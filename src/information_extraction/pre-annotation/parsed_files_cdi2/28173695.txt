Clostridium difficile, which causes pseudomembranous colitis, releases toxin A 
and toxin B. These toxins are considered to be the main causative agents for the 
disease pathogenesis, and their expression is associated with a marked increase 
of apoptosis in mucosal epithelial cells. Colonic epithelial cells are believed 
to form a physical barrier between the lumen and the submucosa, and abnormally 
increased mucosal epithelial cell apoptosis is considered to be an initial step 
in gut inflammation responses. Therefore, one approach to treating 
pseudomembranous colitis would be to develop agents that block the mucosal 
epithelial cell apoptosis caused by toxin A, thus restoring barrier function and 
curing inflammatory responses in the gut. We recently isolated an antimicrobial 
peptide, Periplanetasin-2 (Peri-2, YPCKLNLKLGKVPFH) from the American cockroach, 
whose extracts have shown great potential for clinical use. Here, we assessed 
whether Peri-2 could inhibit the cell toxicity and inflammation caused by C. 
difficile toxin A. Indeed, in human colonocyte HT29 cells, Peri-2 inhibited the 
toxin A-induced decrease in cell proliferation and ameliorated the cell 
apoptosis induced by this toxin. Moreover, in the toxin A-induced mouse 
enteritis model, Peri-2 blocked the mucosal disruption and inflammatory response 
caused by toxin A. These results suggest that the American cockroach peptide 
Peri-2 could be a possible drug candidate for addressing the pseudomembranous 
colitis caused by C. difficile toxin A.
