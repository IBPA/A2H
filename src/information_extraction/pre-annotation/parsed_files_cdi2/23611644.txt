The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Bifidobacterium strains to 
prevent the effects associated with Clostridium difficile infection in a hamster 
model of enterocolitis. After clindamycin treatment (30 mg/kg), animals were 
infected intragastrically with C. difficile (5Ã—108 CFU per animal). Seven days 
prior to antibiotic administration, probiotic treatment was started by 
administering bacterial suspensions of bifidobacteria in drinking water. Strains 
CIDCA 531, CIDCA 5310, CIDCA 5316, CIDCA 5320, CIDCA 5323 and CIDCA 5325 were 
used. Treatment was continued during all the experimental period. Development of 
diarrhoea, enterocolitis and mortality were evaluated. All the infected animals 
belonging to the placebo group developed enterocolitis (5/5) and only two dead 
(2/5) whereas in the group administered with Bifidobacterium bifidum strain 
CIDCA 5310 the ratio of animals with enterocolitis or dead decreased 
significantly (1/5 and 0/5 respectively). Biological activity of caecum contents 
was evaluated in vitro on Vero cells. Animals treated with strain CIDCA 5310 
presented lower biological activity than those belonging to the placebo group. 
The present study shows the potential of selected strains of bifidobacteria to 
antagonise, in vivo, the virulence of C. difficile.
