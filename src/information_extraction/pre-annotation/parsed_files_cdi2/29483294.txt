Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a second messenger that regulates the 
transition from motile to sessile lifestyles in numerous bacteria and controls 
virulence factor production in a variety of pathogens. In Clostridium difficile, 
c-di-GMP negatively regulates flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility and 
promotes the production of type IV pili (TFP), biofilm formation, and surface 
motility in vitro Flagella have been identified as colonization factors in C. 
difficile, but the role of TFP in adherence to host cells and in colonization of 
the mammalian gut is unknown. Here we show that c-di-GMP promotes adherence to 
epithelial cells in vitro, which can be partly attributed to the loss of 
flagella. Using TFP-null mutants, we demonstrate that adherence to epithelial 
cells is partially mediated by TFP and that this TFP-mediated adherence requires 
c-di-GMP regulation. In a mouse model of colonization, the TFP-null mutants 
initially colonized the intestine as well as the parental strain but were 
cleared more quickly. Moreover, compared to the parent strain, C. difficile 
strains lacking TFP were particularly deficient in association with the cecal 
mucosa. Together these data indicate that TFP and their positive regulation by 
c-di-GMP promote attachment of C. difficile to the intestinal epithelium and 
contribute to persistence of C. difficile in the host intestine.
