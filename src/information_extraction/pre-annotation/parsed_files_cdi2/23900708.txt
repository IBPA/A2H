A 23-year-old man living on the island of Hawa'i developed a life threatening 
case of eosinophilic meningitis caused by infection with Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis (rat lungworm disease: RLWD). He was comatose for 3 months, 
incurring brain and nerve damage sufficiently extensive that he was not expected 
to recover. The case was complicated by secondary infections of 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and 
pneumonia, which resulted in an empyema requiring a thoracoscopy and 
decortication. He was treated with prednisone, mebendozal, and pain medication 
for RLWD, and antibiotics and antifungal medications for the secondary 
infections. The administration of herbal supplements was requested by the family 
and approved, and these were administered through a gastric tube. Less than a 
month after being declared in a persistent vegetative state the man was able to 
talk, eat, and had regained some muscle functions. After release from the 
hospital he continued the use of supplements and received treatments of 
intravenous vitamin therapy. Four years after onset of the illness he is able to 
ride a bicycle, is a part time student, plays guitar, and is fluent in two 
foreign languages. RLWD is an emerging tropical disease of growing importance in 
Hawa'i.
