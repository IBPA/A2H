Mouse models have been developed to study the pathogenic process of Clostridium 
difficile infections, first the intestinal colonization and second the toxin 
production. These models have also been used to test the role of environmental 
conditions that modulate infection. Different mouse models have been used 
successfully to study C. difficile infections such as conventional mice, 
gnotobiotic mouse models including the monoxenic C. difficile mouse model, and 
the human microbiota-associated mouse model. The advantages and disadvantages of 
these models are discussed.
