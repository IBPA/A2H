This study was aimed at seeking strains of Clostridium difficile in feces and 
investigation of influence of antibiotics application on frequency of isolation 
and detection of toxing in vivo produced by this microorganism. Samples of feces 
were obtained from experimental dogs consisting of two groups. To groups I 
belonged 150 healthy dogs. Group II consisted of samples of feces received from 
four dogs before and after application of various antibiotics. Clostridium 
difficile was not isolated from group I dogs. From dogs belonging to group II, 
28 strains were isolated. Production of toxing and classification to serological 
groups of the isolated strains were performed. Presence of this microorganism in 
feces of dogs is evident only after multiple application of antibiotics. Results 
of these studies suggest that dogs may constitute a reservoir of Clostridium 
difficile.
