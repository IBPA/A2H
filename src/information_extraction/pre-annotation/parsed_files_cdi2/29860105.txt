The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), human pathogenic 
bacteria (HPB), and antibiotic-resistant HPB (ARHPB) from animal feedlot to 
nearby environment poses a potentially high risk to environmental ecology and 
public health. Here, a metagenomic analysis was employed to explore the 
dissemination of ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from a pig feedlot to surrounding stream 
and agricultural soils. In total, not detectable (ND)-1,628.4 μg/kg of 
antibiotic residues, 18 types of ARGs, 48 HPB species, and 216 ARB isolates were 
detected in all samples. Antibiotic residues from pig feedlot mainly migrated 
into stream sediments and greenhouse soil. The dominant ARGs and HPB species 
from pig feedlot spread into stream sediments (tetracycline resistance genes, 
Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), stream water (multidrug 
resistance (MDR) genes, Shigella flexneri, and Bordetella pertussis), and 
greenhouse soil (MDR genes, Bacillus anthracis, and Brucella melitensis). It is 
concerning that 54.4% of 216 ARB isolates from all samples were potential ARHPB 
species, and genome sequencing and functional annotation of 4 MDR HPB isolates 
showed 9 ARG types. Our findings revealed the potential migration and 
dissemination of antibiotic residues, ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from pig feedlot to 
surrounding stream and agricultural soils via pig sewage discharge and manure 
fertilization.
