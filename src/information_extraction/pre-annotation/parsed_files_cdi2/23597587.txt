Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of antimicrobial-associated 
diarrhea in humans and may cause death. Previously, we discovered that C. 
difficile expresses three polysaccharides, named PSI, PSII, and PSIII. It has 
now been established that PSII is a conserved antigen abundantly present on the 
cell-surface and biofilm of C. difficile. In contrast, the expression of PSI and 
PSIII appears to be stochastic processes. In this work, the total chemical 
synthesis of the PSI pentasaccharide repeating unit carrying a linker at the 
reducing end, 
α-l-Rhap-(1→3)-β-d-Glcp-(1→4)-[α-l-Rhap-(1→3)]-α-d-Glcp-(1→2)-α-d-Glcp-(1→O(CH2)5NH2, 
was achieved by a linear synthesis strategy from four monosaccharide building 
blocks. The synthesized PSI pentasaccharide was conjugated to a subunit of C. 
difficile exotoxin B yielding a potential dual C. difficile vaccine. More 
significantly, sera from healthy horses were shown to contain natural anti-PSI 
IgG antibodies that detected both the synthetic non-phosphorylated PSI repeat 
and the native PSI polysaccharide, with a slightly higher recognition of the 
native PSI polysaccharide.
