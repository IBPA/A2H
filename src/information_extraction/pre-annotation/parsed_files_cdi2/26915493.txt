Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic pathogen that forms spores which promote 
survival in the environment and transmission to new hosts. The regulatory 
pathways by which C. difficile initiates spore formation are poorly understood. 
We identified two factors with limited similarity to the Rap sporulation 
proteins of other spore-forming bacteria. In this study, we show that disruption 
of the gene CD3668 reduces sporulation and increases toxin production and 
motility. This mutant was more virulent and exhibited increased toxin gene 
expression in the hamster model of infection. Based on these phenotypes, we have 
renamed this locus rstA, for regulator of sporulation and toxins. Our data 
demonstrate that RstA is a bifunctional protein that upregulates sporulation 
through an unidentified pathway and represses motility and toxin production by 
influencing sigD transcription. Conserved RstA orthologs are present in other 
pathogenic and industrial Clostridium species and may represent a key regulatory 
protein controlling clostridial sporulation.
