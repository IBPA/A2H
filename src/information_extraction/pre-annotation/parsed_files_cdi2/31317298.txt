PURPOSE: Existing clinical or microbiological scores are not sensitive enough to 
obtain prompt identification of patients at risk of complicated Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI). Our aim was to use a CDI animal model to evaluate 
2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) as a 
marker of severe course of infection.
PROCEDURES: CDI was induced with cefoperazone for 10 days followed by 
clindamycin 1 day before C. difficile inoculation. Mice were divided into wild 
type (n = 6), antibiotic without infection (AC n = 4), h001-infected (n = 5, 
ribotype 001), and h027-infected (n = 5, ribotype 027). Two days after 
inoculation, [18F]FDG-PET was acquired. Weight, general animal condition, and 
survival were monitored daily for 9 days.
RESULTS: h001 group showed symptoms for 4 days with 0 % mortality and a similar 
colon uptake than control animals (h001 0.52 ± 0.20, WT 0.42 ± 0.07, and AC 
0.36 ± 0.06). The h027 group showed symptoms up to 7 days, with 66.7 % of 
mortality 4 days after infection, and significantly higher colon uptake 
(0.93 ± 0.38, p < 0.05). Clinical score was associated to colon and cecum uptake 
(rho = 0.78, p = 0.0001) (rho = 0.73, p = 0.0003).
CONCLUSION: High toxin producer ribotype 027 induced more severe CDI infections, 
correlating with higher colon and cecum [18F]FDG uptake. Colon uptake may 
purportedly serve as early predictor of CDI severity.
