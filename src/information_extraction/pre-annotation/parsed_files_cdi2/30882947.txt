For the human pathogen Clostridioides (also known as Clostridium) difficile, the 
ability to adapt to nutrient availability is critical for its proliferation and 
production of toxins during infection. Synthesis of the toxins is regulated by 
the availability of certain carbon sources, fermentation products and amino 
acids (e.g. proline, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine and valine). The effect of 
proline is attributable at least in part to its role as an inducer and substrate 
of D-proline reductase (PR), a Stickland reaction that regenerates NAD+ from 
NADH. Many Clostridium spp. use Stickland metabolism (co-fermentation of pairs 
of amino acids) to generate ATP and NAD+ . Synthesis of PR is activated by PrdR, 
a proline-responsive regulatory protein. Here we report that PrdR, in the 
presence of proline, represses other NAD+ -generating pathways, such as the 
glycine reductase and succinate-acetyl CoA utilization pathways leading to 
butyrate production, but does so indirectly by affecting the activity of Rex, a 
global redox-sensing regulator that responds to the NAD+ /NADH ratio. Our 
results indicate that PR activity is the favored mechanism for NAD+ regeneration 
and that both Rex and PrdR influence toxin production. Using the hamster model 
of C. difficile infection, we revealed the importance of PrdR-regulated 
Stickland metabolism in the virulence of C. difficile.
