Clostridium difficile infections are a major cause of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea in hospital and care facility patients. In spite of the availability of 
effective antibiotic treatments, C. difficile infection (CDI) is still a major 
cause of patient suffering, death, and substantial health care costs. 
Clostridium difficile exerts its major pathological effects through the actions 
of two protein exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB, which bind to and disrupt gut tissue. 
Antibiotics target the infecting bacteria but not the exotoxins. Administering 
neutralizing antibodies against TcdA and TcdB to patients receiving antibiotic 
treatment might modulate the effects of the exotoxins directly. We have 
developed a mixture of three humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which 
neutralize TcdA and TcdB to address three clinical needs: reduction of the 
severity and duration of diarrhea, reduction of death rates, and reduction of 
the rate of recurrence. The UCB MAb mixture showed higher potency in a variety 
of in vitro binding and neutralization assays (âˆ¼10-fold improvements), higher 
levels of protection in a hamster model of CDI (82% versus 18% at 28 days), and 
higher valencies of toxin binding (12 versus 2 for TcdA and 3 versus 2 for TcdB) 
than other agents in clinical development. Comparisons of the MAb properties 
also offered some insight into the potential relative importance of TcdA and 
TcdB in the disease process.
