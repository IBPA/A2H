The neuropeptide neurotensin mediates several intestinal functions, including 
chloride secretion, motility, and cellular growth. However, whether this peptide 
participates in intestinal inflammation is not known. Toxin A, an enterotoxin 
from Clostridium difficile, mediates pseudomembranous colitis in humans. In 
animal models, toxin A causes an acute inflammatory response characterized by 
activation of sensory neurons and intestinal nerves and immune cells of the 
lamina propria. Here we show that neurotensin and its receptor are elevated in 
the rat colonic mucosa following toxin A administration. Pretreatment of rats 
with the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR-48, 692 inhibits toxin A-induced 
changes in colonic secretion, mucosal permeability, and histologic damage. 
Exposure of colonic explants to toxin A or neurotensin causes mast cell 
degranulation, which is inhibited by SR-48,692. Because substance P was 
previously shown to mediate mast cell activation, we examined whether substance 
P is involved in neurotensin-induced mast cell degranulation. Our results show 
that neurotensin-induced mast cell degranulation in colonic explants is 
inhibited by the substance P (neurokinin-1) receptor antagonist CP-96,345, 
indicating that colonic mast activation in response to neurotensin involves 
release of substance P. We conclude that neurotensin plays a key role in the 
pathogenesis of C. difficile-induced colonic inflammation and mast cell 
activation.
