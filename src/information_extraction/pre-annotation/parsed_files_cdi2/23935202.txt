Clostridium difficile infection is the main cause of healthcare-acquired 
diarrhea in the developed world. In addition to the main virulence factors toxin 
A and B, epidemic, PCR Ribotype 027 strains, such as R20291, produce a third 
toxin, CDT. To develop effective medical countermeasures, it is important to 
understand the importance of each toxin. Accordingly, we created all possible 
combinations of isogenic toxin mutants of R20291 and assessed their virulence. 
We demonstrated that either toxin A or toxin B alone can cause fulminant disease 
in the hamster infection model and present tantalizing data that C. difficile 
toxin may also contribute to virulence.
