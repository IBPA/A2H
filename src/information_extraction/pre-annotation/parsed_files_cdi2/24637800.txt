Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea. 
Recently, we have shown that effective protection can be mediated in hamsters 
through the inclusion of specific recombinant fragments from toxin A and B in a 
systemically delivered vaccine. Interestingly while neutralizing antibodies to 
the binding domains of both toxin A and B are moderately protective, enhanced 
survival is observed when fragments from the glucosyltransferase region of toxin 
B replace those from the binding domain of this toxin. In this addendum, we 
discuss additional information that has been derived from such vaccination 
studies. This includes observations on efficacy and cross-protection against 
different ribotypes mediated by these vaccines and the challenges that remain 
for a vaccine which prevents clinical symptoms but not colonization. The use and 
value of vaccination both in the prevention of infection and for treatment of 
disease relapse will be discussed.
