In mucosal secretions, secretory component (SC) is found either free or bound to 
polymeric IgA within the secretory IgA complex. SC displays numerous and various 
glycans, which are potential ligands for bacterial compounds. We first 
established that human SC (hSC) purified from colostrum (hSCcol) or produced in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells (hSCrec) exhibits the same lectin reactivity. Both 
forms bind to Clostridium difficile toxin A and functionally protect polarized 
Caco-2 cell monolayers from the cytopathic effect of the toxin. The interaction 
is mediated by glycans present on hSC and involves galactose and sialic acid 
residues. hSCcol and hSCrec were also shown to bind enteropathogenic Escherichia 
coli adhesin intimin and to inhibit its infectivity on HEp-2 cells in a 
glycan-dependent manner as well. SC remained operative in the context of the 
whole secretory IgA molecule and can therefore enhance its Fab-mediated 
neutralizing properties. On the contrary, hSC did not interact with three 
different strains of rotavirus (RF, RRV, and SA11). Accordingly, infection of 
target MA104 cells with these rotavirus strains was not reduced in the presence 
of either form of hSC tested. Although not a universal mechanism, these findings 
identify hSC as a microbial scavenger contributing to the antipathogenic arsenal 
that protects the body epithelial surfaces.
