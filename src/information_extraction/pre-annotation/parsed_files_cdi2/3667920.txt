Thirty stool filtrates known to contain Clostridium difficile toxin based on 
previous testing on McCoy cells were tested for toxicity on primary African 
green monkey kidney (AGMK), McCoy, MRC-5, primary rhesus monkey kidney (RMK), 
and Vero cells. All 30 filtrates showed cytotoxic effect at greater than or 
equal to 1:100 dilution on McCoy and Vero cells. A total of 22 filtrates were 
positive on MRC-5 monolayers, while only 16 and 10 filtrates showed positive 
cytotoxic effect on AGMK and RMK cells, respectively. Another 630 stool 
specimens were tested on McCoy and Vero cells only. Of these stool filtrates, 70 
were positive and 560 were negative with both cell lines, which thus gave 100% 
agreement. Vero cells can be used interchangeably with McCoy cells for the 
detection of C. difficile toxin in stool filtrates.
