Intraperitoneal administration of toxins of Clostridium difficile to mice 
resulted in loss of hepatic cytochrome P450 and peroxidation of microsomal 
lipids. Pretreatment with the microsomal enzyme inducer beta-naphthoflavone 
partially alleviated these effects and increased survival time of intoxicated 
animals.
