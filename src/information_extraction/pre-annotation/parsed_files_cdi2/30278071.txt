OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile infection is a public health concern. C. 
difficile was found in healthy human intestine as a member of Clostridium XI. 
Because soluble fermentable fiber ingestion affects intestinal microbiota, we 
used fiber-containing diets to determine the intestinal microbial condition that 
could reduce the presence of Clostridium XI.
METHODS: Newly weaned male mice were assigned to three published diets: Control 
AIN-93G purified diet with only poorly fermented cellulose; Control plus 5% 
purified fermentable fiber inulin; Chow with wheat, soybean and corn that 
provide a mixture of unpurified dietary fibers. Methods were developed to 
quantify 24-hour fecal microbial load and microbial DNA density. The relative 
abundance of bacterial genera and the bacterial diversity were determined 
through 16S rRNA sequence-based fecal microbiota analysis.
RESULTS: Mice adjusted food intake to maintain the same energy intake and body 
weight under these three moderate-fat (7% w:w) diets. Chow-feeding led to higher 
food intake but also higher 24-h fecal output. Chow-feeding and 1-8 wk ingestion 
of inulin-supplemented diet increased daily fecal microbial load and density 
along with lowering the prevalence of Clostridium XI to undetectable. 
Clostridium XI remained undetectable until 4 weeks after the termination of 
inulin-supplemented diet. Fermentable fiber intake did not consistently increase 
probiotic genera such as Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus. Chow feeding, but not 
inulin supplementation, increased the bacterial diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: Increase fecal microbial load/density upon fermentable fiber 
ingestion is associated with a lower and eventually undetectable presence of 
Clostridium XI. Higher bacterial diversity or abundance of particular genera is 
not apparently essential. Future studies are needed to see whether this 
observation can be translated into the reduction of C. difficile at the species 
level in at-risk populations.
