Eight commonly used cephalosporins were evaluated in the hamster colitis mode. 
They were all found to cause hemorrhagic cecitis and death within 10 days of 
being given as subcutaneous or oral challenges. Necropsy findings were 
indistinguishable from clindamycin-induced cecitis. Bacteria-free cecal filtrate 
obtained from hamsters dying of cephalosporin-induced cecitis contained toxin 
similar or identical to hat produced by Clostridium difficile isolated from the 
cecum of a hamster. Daily oral administration of poorly absorbed cephalosporins 
protected hamsters from clindamycin-induced cecitis and death as long as the 
cephalosporins were continued. The absorbable cephalosporins were ineffective in 
protecting hamsters from clindamycin-induced cecitis. This difference probably 
relates to the lower concentrations of absorbable cephalosporins maintained in 
the ceca of the hamsters. The possible correlation of these findings to human 
cases of cephalosporin-induced pseudomembranous colitis is discussed.
