Improved understanding of the interplay between host and microbes stands to 
illuminate new avenues for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Here, 
we provide a high-resolution view of the dynamics between host and gut 
microbiota during antibiotic-induced intestinal microbiota depletion, 
opportunistic Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium difficile pathogenesis, and 
recovery from these perturbed states in a mouse model. Host-centric proteome and 
microbial community profiles provide a nuanced longitudinal view, revealing the 
interdependence between host and microbiota in evolving dysbioses. Time- and 
condition-specific molecular and microbial signatures are evident and clearly 
distinguished from pathogen-independent inflammatory fingerprints. Our data 
reveal that mice recovering from antibiotic treatment or C. difficile infection 
retain lingering signatures of inflammation, despite compositional normalization 
of the microbiota, and host responses could be rapidly and durably relieved 
through fecal transplant. These experiments demonstrate insights that emerge 
from the combination of these orthogonal, untargeted approaches to the 
gastrointestinal ecosystem.
