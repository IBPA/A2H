Several procedures have been described for the culture of Clostridium difficile 
from stool specimens. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness 
of five of these methods for the isolation of C. difficile from feces of 
patients suspected of having C. difficile-associated illness. A total of 564 
stool specimens were cultured by using heat shock, ethanol treatment (ET), and 
direct plating on Carr-Scarborough cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) 
with horse blood (C/S medium), BBL CCFA medium, and Remel C. difficile agar. 
Cytotoxin assays were performed on all specimens. A total of 113 specimens (20%) 
were positive for C. difficile by one or more methods. The numbers of positive 
cultures by using heat shock, ET, and direct plating on C/S medium, BBL CCFA 
medium, and Remel C. difficile agar were 79 (70%), 89 (79%), 91 (81%), 79 (70%), 
and 52 (46%), respectively. We concluded that ET and direct plating on C/S 
medium were the most effective procedures for isolating C. difficile from stool 
specimens and found significant variation in the performance of modified CCFA 
from different manufacturers.
