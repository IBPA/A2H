A total of 313 faecal samples from three pig farms and two cattle farms was 
collected, and Clostridium difficile was isolated from 133/257 piglet samples 
(51.8%) and from 1/56 calf samples (1.8%). Toxins were tested only in calf 
samples and were positive in 44.6% (25/56). The only bovine isolate belonged to 
toxinotype XIa (A(-)B(-)CDT(+)). Porcine isolates belonged to toxinotype 0 
(A(+)B(+)CDT(-)) and toxinotype V (A(+)B(+)CDT(+)). Of the two ribotypes usually 
found in toxinotype V, the strains isolated in this study showed a greater 
similarity to ribotype 066 than to ribotype 078.
