We have noted that prairie dogs given cefoxitin develop diarrhea and lose weight 
yet survive for periods of up to 4 weeks. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis 
that cefoxitin causes Clostridium difficile cecitis in prairie dogs. Six prairie 
dogs were given a single intramuscular dose of 100 mg of cefoxitin per kg of 
body weight, and six control animals received saline; both groups were 
sacrificed 1 week later. Controls had no diarrhea and lost 2% of their body 
weight, whereas cefoxitin-treated animals had diarrhea (P less than 0.001) and 
lost 16% of their body weight (P less than 0.001); one animals died 6 days after 
cefoxitin challenge. None of the controls yielded C. difficile or had cecal 
cytotoxin or pseudomembranes detected. Cecal contents from all cefoxitin-treated 
animals, however, yielded C. difficile (P less than 0.01) and had cecal 
cytotoxin present (P less than 0.01). Four of five surviving animals also had 
cecal pseudomembranes present (P less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that 
in prairie dogs cefoxitin induces C. difficile cecitis. We conclude that the 
prairie dog is another model for the study of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. The 
disease in prairie dogs may have a more chronic course than in other animal 
models of C. difficile-induced diarrhea and may be useful as a model for 
studying certain aspects of C. difficile-induced diarrhea.
