Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 046 was found in 67% of neonatal piglets 
(45/67) sampled from three separate pig-breeding farms in Sweden. Sows from the 
same farms were tested and 50% were colonized in faeces and 30% were colonized 
on skin. An environmental source was suggested because identical PCR ribotypes 
were isolated from faeces as well as externally. Human C. difficile infection 
outbreaks in southern Sweden by the identical PCR ribotype 046 indicate its 
zoonotic potential.
