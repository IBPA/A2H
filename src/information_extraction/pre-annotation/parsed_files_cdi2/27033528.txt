Today the interest toward horse (Equus caballus) and donkey (Equus asinus) milk 
for human consumption is receiving a renewed attention because of its particular 
composition, hypoallergenicity, and nutraceutical properties. The realistic 
perspective of global use of this aliment in balanced diets, especially for 
infancy and geriatrics, poses the need for a more in depth knowledge on milk 
hygiene and on the health status of dairy animals, as a prerequisite of 
consumers' safety. The aim of this paper was to review the available literature 
on the health and hygiene parameters as well as on the potential microbiological 
hazards in horse and donkey milk and the risks related to their consumption. 
Both microbial contamination and somatic cell count are reasonably low in equine 
milk and also the presence of pathogens, like Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella 
spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Brucella spp., Mycobacterium 
spp., Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazakii, Streptococcus equi subsp. 
zooepidemicus, Rhodococcus equi, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, 
Clostridium difficile and Burkholderia mallei is low. However, in those regions 
of the world where the prevalence of Brucella spp. and Rhodococcus equi is high, 
the alimentary risks could increase. Similarly, in areas with higher incidence 
of immunocompromised people, the increased risks should be warned not only for 
pathogens but also for opportunistic microbiota.
