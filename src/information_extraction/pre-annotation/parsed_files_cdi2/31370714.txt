Enteric glial cells (EGCs), one main cell population of the enteric nervous 
system (ENS), play a major role in regulating intestinal barrier function. 
Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is the major virulence factor produced by 
C. difficile and estimated to be toxic to EGCs by inducing cell death, cell 
cycle arrest, and inflammatory cytokine production; however, the detailed 
mechanism for such effect is still unclear. In this study, we further evaluated 
the toxic effect of TcdB on EGCs and the involvement of NADPH oxidases in such 
process using the rat-transformed EGCs (CRL-2690). The results showed that NOX4 
was activated by TcdB in EGCs and functioned as the major factor causing 
cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, NOX4-generated H2O2 was the 
inducer of oxidative stress, Ca2+ homeostasis disorder, and ER stress in EGCs 
upon TcdB treatment, and NOX4 inhibition protected EGCs against TcdB toxicity 
via attenuating these dysfunctions. These findings contribute to our 
understanding of the mechanism by which TcdB affects EGCs and suggest the 
potential value of NOX4 inhibition for treatment against C. difficile infection.
