Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a key virulence factor of bacterium and 
induces intestinal inflammatory disease. Because of its potent cytotoxic and 
proinflammatory activities, we investigated the utility of TcdB in developing 
anti-tumor immunity. TcdB induced cell death in mouse colorectal cancer CT26 
cells, and the intoxicated cells stimulated the activation of mouse bone 
marrow-derived dendritic cells and subsequent T cell activation in vitro. 
Immunization of BALB/c mice with toxin-treated CT26 cells elicited potent 
anti-tumor immunity that protected mice from a lethal challenge of the same 
tumor cells and rejected pre-injected tumors. The anti-tumor immunity generated 
was cell-mediated, long-term, and tumor-specific. Further experiments 
demonstrated that the intact cell bodies were important for the immunogenicity 
since lysing the toxin-treated tumor cells reduced their ability to induce 
antitumor immunity. Finally, we showed that TcdB is able to induce potent 
anti-tumor immunity in B16-F10 melanoma model. Taken together, these data 
demonstrate the utility of C. difficile toxin B for developing anti-tumor 
immunity.
