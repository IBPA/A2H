The global prevalence of severe Clostridium difficile infection highlights the 
profound clinical significance of clostridial glucosylating toxins. Virulence is 
dependent on the autoactivation of a toxin cysteine protease, which is promoted 
by the allosteric cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Host mechanisms 
that protect against such exotoxins are poorly understood. It is increasingly 
appreciated that the pleiotropic functions attributed to nitric oxide (NO), 
including host immunity, are in large part mediated by S-nitrosylation of 
proteins. Here we show that C. difficile toxins are S-nitrosylated by the 
infected host and that S-nitrosylation attenuates virulence by inhibiting toxin 
self-cleavage and cell entry. Notably, InsP(6)- and inositol pyrophosphate 
(InsP(7))-induced conformational changes in the toxin enabled host 
S-nitrosothiols to transnitrosylate the toxin catalytic cysteine, which forms 
part of a structurally conserved nitrosylation motif. Moreover, treatment with 
exogenous InsP(6) enhanced the therapeutic actions of oral S-nitrosothiols in 
mouse models of C. difficile infection. Allostery in bacterial proteins has thus 
been successfully exploited in the evolutionary development of 
nitrosothiol-based innate immunity and may provide an avenue to new therapeutic 
approaches.
