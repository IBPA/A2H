BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxins alter permeability in cultured 
enterocytes and may alter intestinal epithelial permeability to bacteria in 
vivo. Experiments were designed to test the effects of C. difficile toxins on in 
vitro interactions of Enterococcus gallinarum with cultured enterocytes, as well 
as on translocation of E. gallinarum in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mature Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes were pretreated with 
C. difficile toxin A or toxin B followed by incubation with E. gallinarum. E. 
gallinarum-enterocyte interactions were assessed by quantitative culture. For in 
vivo experiments, antibiotic-treated mice were orally inoculated with C. 
difficile or saline, and all mice were orally inoculated 24 h later with E. 
gallinarum and sacrificed after another 24 h for analysis of cecal bacteria, 
cecal C. difficile toxin, and enterococcal translocation. Cecal C. difficile 
toxin was assayed as cytopathic effects on human foreskin fibroblasts.
RESULTS: Although neither toxin had a noticeable effect on bacterial 
internalization by cultured enterocytes, C. difficile toxins were associated 
with increased E. gallinarum transmigration across confluent enterocyte 
cultures. Mice orally inoculated with saline rather than C. difficile (n = 29) 
had no detectable cecal toxin, while mice orally inoculated with C. difficile (n 
= 30) had detectable cecal toxin. Viable E. gallinarum was recovered from the 
mesenteric lymph nodes of 97% of mice orally inoculated with saline followed by 
oral E. gallinarum, but only 37% of mice orally inoculated with C. difficile 
followed by oral E. gallinarum (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that observations with cultured 
enterocytes, demonstrating that C. difficile toxins facilitated bacterial 
migration across the intestinal epithelium, might have little in vivo relevance 
in a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile overgrowth.
