Yogurt exhibits in vitro bactericidal activity against a variety of pathogenic 
microorganisms, including Clostridium difficile. In the present studies, we 
tested whether yogurt ingestion could prevent or ameliorate antibiotic 
associated colitis in the clindamycin-treated hamster model. Male golden Syrian 
hamsters were given 5 mg/kg clindamycin subcutaneously 24 hr before and 6 hr 
following inoculation with 0.5 ml of less than 10, 10(3), 10(5), or 10(6) CFU/ml 
of C. difficile. Hamsters in the control group ingested chow and water ad 
libitum, whereas the experimental group ingested chow and a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 
yogurt and water ad libitum, beginning 24 hr before the first injection of 
clindamycin and continuing throughout the course of the study. Animals were 
monitored for colonization with C. difficile, pathological evidence of colitis, 
and death. Mortality was 100% in yogurt-treated animals, and all animals showed 
histological changes of severe colitis. Fecal and intestinal segment cultures 
were positive for C. difficile in all animals. Thus, in the hamster model, we 
found no evidence to support the possible efficacy of yogurt in the prevention 
of C. difficile colitis.
