Clostridium difficile vaccines composed of surface polysaccharides (PSs) have 
the potential to simultaneously control infection and colonization levels in 
humans. Hot water-phenol treatment of C. difficile biomass can extricate 
water-soluble PS-I and PS-II; and water- and phenol-soluble PS-III. C. difficile 
vaccines based on PS-II have attracted the most attention due its facile 
purification and ubiquitous expression by C. difficile ribotypes. Anti PS-II 
antibodies recognize both C. difficile vegetative cell and sporulating 
preparations and confer protection against C. difficile infection in a mouse 
model. The design of such an efficacious C. difficile PS-II conjugate vaccine is 
described here.
