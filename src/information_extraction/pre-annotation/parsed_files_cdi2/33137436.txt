Despite being incapable of causing Clostridium difficile infection, 
non-toxigenic C. difficile (NTCD) may still be relevant. This study explored the 
role of NTCD as a reservoir of accessory antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in 
NTCD from Southeast Asia. This region has high rates of antimicrobial use, a 
high prevalence of NTCD and phenotypic AMR in such strains. More than half of 
the 28 NTCD strains investigated had at least one accessory AMR gene on mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs) which were similar to the elements found in other 
bacteria, including Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Streptococcus suis, both of 
which are found in the pig gut. Thus, C. difficile may facilitate the movement 
of AMR genes between different hosts within a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. 
C. difficile β-lactamases were not located on MGEs and were unlikely to be 
transferred. Concordance between the MLSB resistance genotype and phenotype was 
low, suggesting multiple resistance mechanisms, many of which remain unknown. On 
the contrary, there was a high concordance between resistance genotype and 
phenotype for both fluoroquinolones and rifaximin. From an epidemiological 
perspective, NTCD populations in Southeast Asia comprised members of 
evolutionary clades 1 and 4, which are thought to have originated from Europe 
and Asia, respectively. This population structure reflects the close 
relationship between the people of the two regions.
