An enzyme immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) to detect 
hamster antibody to toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile was developed in 
which toxin preparations are used to coat the solid phase. The specificity of 
the assay was supported by blocking tests with the toxin preparations and 
proteins from a nontoxigenic strain. Sera from immunized and control hamsters 
were tested by this technique, and results were compared with those from a 
cytotoxicity neutralization assay. Antibody to toxins A and B assayed by ELISA 
showed a close quantitative correlation with antibody titers obtained by 
cytotoxicity neutralization. The ELISA assays described appear to provide a 
sensitive, specific, and practical method to define the prevalence of antibody 
to C. difficile toxins. These assays could be readily applied to human sera to 
examine and study the immune response of patients with C. difficile-induced 
disease.
