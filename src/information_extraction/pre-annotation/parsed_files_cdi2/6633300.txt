A total of 55 strains of Clostridium sordellii, 21 lethal toxin-positive and 34 
lethal toxin-negative, were tested for cytotoxin production in brain heart 
infusion medium supplemented with 0.2% Na2HPO4 (m-BHI) and cooked-meat-glucose 
(CMG) medium using baby hamster kidney (BHK-21/WI-2) cells as indicator cells. 
The m-BHI medium was preferred to CMG medium and 24 hr of incubation was 
sufficient for cytotoxin production. Nineteen of the 21 toxigenic strains were 
also cytotoxigenic, and the strength of the cytotoxigenicity was approximately 
parallel with that of the lethal toxigenicity. Clostridium difficile antitoxin 
neutralized C. sordellii cytotoxin and also C. sordellii antitoxin neutralized 
C. difficile cytotoxin.
