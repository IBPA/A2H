Studies suggest that asymptomatic colonization with Clostridium difficile (CD) 
decreases the risk of CD-associated disease (CDAD) in humans. A hamster model 
was used to test the efficacy of colonization with 3 nontoxigenic CD strains for 
preventing CDAD after exposure to toxigenic CD. Groups of 10 hamsters were given 
10(6) nontoxigenic CD spores 2 days after receiving a single dose of 
clindamycin. Five days later, the hamsters were given 100 spores of 1 of 3 
toxigenic CD strains previously shown to cause mortality within 48 h. Each 
nontoxigenic strain prevented disease in 87%-97% of hamsters that were 
challenged with toxigenic strains. Failure to prevent CDAD was associated with 
failure of colonization with nontoxigenic CD. Colonization with nontoxigenic CD 
strains is highly effective in preventing CDAD in hamsters challenged with 
toxigenic CD strains, which suggests that use of a probiotic strategy for CDAD 
prevention in humans receiving antibiotics might be beneficial.
