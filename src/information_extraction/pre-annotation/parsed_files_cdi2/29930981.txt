BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) and C difficile toxin 
toxin B (TcdB), the major virulence factors of the bacterium, cause intestinal 
tissue damage and inflammation. Although the 2 toxins are homologous and share a 
similar domain structure, TcdA is generally more inflammatory whereas TcdB is 
more cytotoxic. The functional domain of the toxins that govern the 
proinflammatory activities of the 2 toxins is unknown.
METHODS: Here, we investigated toxin domain functions that regulate the 
proinflammatory activity of C difficile toxins. By using a mouse ilea loop 
model, human tissues, and immune cells, we examined the inflammatory responses 
to a series of chimeric toxins or toxin mutants deficient in specific domain 
functions.
RESULTS: Blocking autoprocessing of TcdB by mutagenesis or chemical inhibition, 
while reducing cytotoxicity of the toxin, significantly enhanced its 
proinflammatory activities in the animal model. Furthermore, a noncleavable 
mutant TcdB was significantly more potent than the wild-type toxin in the 
induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human colonic tissues and immune 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a novel mechanism of regulating the 
biological activities of C difficile toxins in that cysteine protease-mediated 
autoprocessing regulates toxins' proinflammatory activities. Our findings 
provide new insight into the pathogenesis of C difficile infection and the 
design of therapeutics against the disease.
