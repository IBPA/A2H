Ten isolates of Clostridium difficile expressing different degrees of 
toxigenicity and virulence in an animal model were assayed for the production of 
proteolytic enzymes by various methods. All strains demonstrated some activity 
in one or more of the assay systems. There was no direct correlation between 
toxigenic status and enzyme production. However, those strains known to be 
highly virulent in a hamster model were the most proteolytic. The most commonly 
detected enzyme was cell associated, and its substrate specificity suggested it 
was a trypsin-like enzyme. Initial purification of the enzyme from strain VPI 
10463 gave a 10% yield with a 14-fold increase in purity. Inhibition studies on 
this preparation indicated that the enzyme was a thiol protease. The enzyme has 
pH and temperature optima of 7.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively. These 
characteristics suggest that the enzyme is more related to clostripain, the 
thiol clostridio-peptidase of C. histolyticum, than to trypsin. Whilst the role 
of this enzyme remains unclear, it is possible that it may be a contributory 
factor in the virulence of the organism as described for other clostridial 
infections.
