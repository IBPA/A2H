The primary challenge for treating Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) is 
maintenance of clinical response after the end of treatment (sustained clinical 
response). Disease recurrence following a positive clinical response occurs in 
approximately 6-25 % of patients after the first episode and in up to 65 % for 
subsequent recurrences. Surotomycin, a novel cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with 
a core derived by Streptomyces roseosporus fermentation, disrupts C. difficile 
cellular membrane activity in both logarithmic and stationary phases and 
minimally disturbs normal gastrointestinal microbiota because of its lack of 
activity against Gram-negative anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Preclinical 
and clinical evidence indicate that surotomycin has low oral bioavailability, 
allowing gastrointestinal tract concentrations to greatly exceed its minimum 
inhibitory concentration for C. difficile. Surotomycin is well tolerated and 
effective in hamster models of CDI. Phase 2 clinical evidence suggests that 
surotomycin (250 mg twice daily) is an effective CDI treatment, with 
statistically lower recurrence rates than vancomycin.
