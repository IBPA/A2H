Soft feces and a decreased delivery rate were observed in a 
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C3H-scid mouse breeding colony. Grossly, the ceca 
were shrunken and edematous in the affected mice. Histopathologically, severe 
edema in the cecal submucosa as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells in 
the lamina propria and submucosa of the ceca and colon were observed. No 
pathogenic microorganisms were detected by the routine microbiological tests. By 
anaerobic bacterial-examination, Clostridium (C.) difficile with toxin A was 
isolated from the cecal contents of the affected mice. The mice were diagnosed 
with C. difficile-associated colitis. This case appears to be the first report 
of natural infection with C. difficile in SPF mice with clinical signs.
