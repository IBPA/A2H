In Sweden there are several reports of mares developing acute colitis while 
their foals were being treated orally for Rhodococcus equi pneumonia with the 
combination of erythromycin and rifampicin. In this study 6 adult horses were 
given low oral dosages of these antibiotics, singly or in combination. Within 3 
days post administration of erythromycin, in one case in combination with 
rifampicin, 2 horses developed severe colitis (one fatal). Clostridium difficile 
was isolated from one of the horses, whereas no specific pathogens were isolated 
from the other. Both horses had typical changes in blood parameters seen in 
acute colitis. Clostridium difficile was also isolated from the faeces of a 
third horse given an even lower dosage of erythromycin in combination with 
rifampicin. This horse developed very mild clinical symptoms and recovered 
spontaneously. In the fourth horse given erythromycin only, very high numbers of 
Clostridium perfringens were isolated. The horses given rifampicin only did not 
develop any clinical symptoms and there were no major changes in their faecal 
flora. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that low dosages of erythromycin 
ethylsuccinate can induce severe colitis in horses associated with major changes 
of the intestinal microflora. Clostridium difficile has been demonstrated as a 
potential aetiological agent in antibiotic-induced acute colitis.
