The population structure of Clostridium difficile currently comprises eight 
major genomic clades. For the highly divergent C-I clade, only two toxigenic 
strains have been reported, which lack the tcdA and tcdC genes and carry a 
complete locus for the binary toxin (CDT) next to an atypical TcdB monotoxin 
pathogenicity locus (PaLoc). As part of a routine surveillance of C. difficile 
in stool samples from diarrheic human patients, we discovered three isolates 
that consistently gave negative results in a PCR-based screening for tcdC. 
Through phenotypic assays, whole-genome sequencing, experiments in cell 
cultures, and infection biomodels we show that these three isolates (i) escape 
common laboratory diagnostic procedures, (ii) represent new ribotypes, 
PFGE-types, and sequence types within the Clade C-I, (iii) carry chromosomal or 
plasmidal TcdBs that induce classical or variant cytopathic effects (CPE), and 
(iv) cause different levels of cytotoxicity and hamster mortality rates. These 
results show that new strains of C. difficile can be detected by more refined 
techniques and raise questions on the origin, evolution, and distribution of the 
toxin loci of C. difficile and the mechanisms by which this emerging pathogen 
causes disease.
