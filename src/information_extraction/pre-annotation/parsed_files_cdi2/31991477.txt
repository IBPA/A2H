A multitude of diverse microorganisms, termed the microbiota, reside in the gut, 
respiratory tract, skin, and genital tract of humans and other animals. Recent 
advances in metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics have enabled detailed 
characterization of these vital microbial communities. Studies in animal models 
have uncovered vital previously unrecognized roles for the microbiota in normal 
function of the immune responses, and when perturbed, in the pathogenesis of 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, but also at distant sites in 
the body including the brain. The composition of gut and respiratory microbiota 
can influence systemic inflammatory responses that mediate asthma, allergy, 
inflammatory bowel disease, obesity-related diseases, and neurodevelopmental or 
neurodegenerative conditions. Experiments in mouse models as well as emerging 
clinical studies have revealed that therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota, 
using fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, or engineered probiotics 
represent effective nontoxic approaches for the treatment or prevention of 
Clostridium difficile infection, allergy, and autoimmune diseases and may 
enhance the efficacy of certain cancer immunotherapeutics. This review discusses 
how commensal bacteria can influence immune responses that mediate a range of 
human diseases and how the microbiota are being targeted to treat these 
diseases, especially those resistant to pharmacological therapies.
