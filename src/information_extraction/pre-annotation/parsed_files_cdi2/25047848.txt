In the past decade, Clostridium difficile has emerged as an important gut 
pathogen. Symptoms of C. difficile infection range from mild diarrhea to 
pseudomembranous colitis. Besides the two main virulence factors toxin A and 
toxin B, other virulence factors are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis 
of the disease. In other Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, 
conserved high-temperature requirement A (HtrA)-like proteases have been shown 
to have a role in protein homeostasis and quality control. This affects the 
functionality of virulence factors and the resistance of bacteria to 
(host-induced) environmental stresses. We found that the C. difficile 630 genome 
encodes a single HtrA-like protease (CD3284; HtrA) and have analyzed its role in 
vivo and in vitro through the creation of an isogenic ClosTron-based htrA mutant 
of C. difficile strain 630Î”erm (wild type). In contrast to the attenuated 
phenotype seen with htrA deletion in other pathogens, this mutant showed 
enhanced virulence in the Golden Syrian hamster model of acute C. difficile 
infection. Microarray data analysis showed a pleiotropic effect of htrA on the 
transcriptome of C. difficile, including upregulation of the toxin A gene. In 
addition, the htrA mutant showed reduced spore formation and adherence to 
colonic cells. Together, our data show that htrA can modulate virulence in C. 
difficile.
