Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of nosocomial and 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. A vaccine, based on formalin-inactivated toxins 
A and B purified from anaerobic cultures of C. difficile strain VPI 10463 
(toxinotype 0), has been in development for the prevention of symptomatic CDI. 
We evaluated the breadth of protection conferred by this C. difficile toxoid 
vaccine in cross-neutralization assessments using sera from vaccinated hamsters 
against a collection of 165 clinical isolates. Hamster antisera raised against 
the C. difficile toxoid vaccine neutralized the cytotoxic activity of culture 
supernatants from several toxinotype 0 strains and heterologous strains from 10 
different toxinotypes. Further assessments performed with purified toxins 
confirmed that vaccine-elicited antibodies can neutralize both A and B toxins 
from a variety of toxinotypes. In the hamster challenge model, the vaccine 
conferred significant cross-protection against disease symptoms and death caused 
by heterologous C. difficile strains from the most common phylogenetic clades, 
including the most prevalent toxinotypes.
