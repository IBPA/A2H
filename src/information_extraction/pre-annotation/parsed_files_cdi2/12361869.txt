The hair cells (HCs) are the most vulnerable elements in the cochlea and damage 
to them is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Understanding 
the intracellular events that lead to the death of HCs is a key to developing 
protective strategies. Recently, it has been shown that the c-Jun-N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in HCs in response to aminoglycosides (J. 
Neurosci. 20 (2000) 43). We have studied the upstream events leading to JNK 
activation in aminoglycoside toxicity in vitro. The small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 
are well known upstream activators of JNK in other cell types. Clostridium 
difficile toxin B monoglucosylates all members of the Rho GTPase subfamily (Rho, 
Rac and Cdc42 isoforms) and inhibits GTP binding by steric interference (Nature 
341 (1989) 209). Organ of Corti explants from p5 rat basal turns were maintained 
in tissue culture and treated with C. difficile toxin B for 12 h. They were then 
treated with toxin B plus gentamicin for 72 h. Significantly less HC death was 
observed compared to with gentamicin alone. Toxin B alone had no effect on HCs 
at the highest concentration used. Using antibodies against phospho-c-Jun, we 
observed background immunoreactivity in control explants, strong staining of 
outer hair cell nuclei in gentamicin treated explants, and weaker immunostaining 
in explants treated with gentamicin and C. difficile toxin B. We conclude that 
Rho family small GTPases play a role in aminoglycoside toxicity signaling as 
upstream activators of the JNK signaling pathway.
