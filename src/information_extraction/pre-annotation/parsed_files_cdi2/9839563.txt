Bacteraemia and subsequent sepsis is one possible complication of Clostridium 
difficile infection. The aim of this study was to examine a correlation between 
bacterial translocation with morphological changes of intestinal mucosa and 
shifts of intestinal microflora in experimental models of C. difficile 
infection. A mouse model was used to study post-antibiotic shifts and mild C. 
difficile infection, and hamsters were used to study fatal enterocolitis. The 
influence of pro- and pre-biotics (lactobacilli and xylitol) were also studied 
in the hamster model. The quantitative composition of luminal and mucosal 
microflora was evaluated in different intestinal loci, inflammatory changes of 
mucosa were estimated in histological sections and bacterial translocation was 
detected in samples from blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In 
cases of mild C. difficile infection, the extent of disturbance of intestinal 
microflora appeared to be a more important promoting factor in translocation 
than inflammatory activity in the mucosa. Translocation was frequent in fatal 
enterocolitis, with facultative species predominating in the intestinal mucosa 
and also C. difficile in some cases. The combination of lactobacilli and xylitol 
had some protective effect against C. difficile infection in these models.
