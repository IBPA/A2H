To identify factors that regulate gut microbiota density and the impact of 
varied microbiota density on health, we assayed this fundamental ecosystem 
property in fecal samples across mammals, human disease, and therapeutic 
interventions. Physiologic features of the host (carrying capacity) and the 
fitness of the gut microbiota shape microbiota density. Therapeutic manipulation 
of microbiota density in mice altered host metabolic and immune homeostasis. In 
humans, gut microbiota density was reduced in Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The gut microbiota in recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection had lower density and reduced fitness that were 
restored by fecal microbiota transplantation. Understanding the interplay 
between microbiota and disease in terms of microbiota density, host carrying 
capacity, and microbiota fitness provide new insights into microbiome structure 
and microbiome targeted therapeutics.
