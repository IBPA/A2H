The protein antisecretory factor (AF) inhibits intestinal fluid secretion 
induced by the cholera toxin (CT) and Clostridium difficile toxin A (CDA). The 
present work investigated whether CT-induced AF protects against the enterotoxin 
action by CDA. Rats were pretreated perorally with CT or buffer as control, 
whereafter CDA-induced fluid secretion and cytotoxicity was tested in vivo in 
ligated intestinal loops; the mucosal level of AF was estimated using the 
Western blot technique. Rats given repeated peroral doses of CT became tolerant 
to CDA, the inhibition of fluid secretion and of cytotoxicity being 79% in eight 
out of nine animals. The repeated CT-treatment also induced long-lasting rise of 
AF in the mucosal epithelium. Recombinant AF given either perorally or 
intravenously inhibited both fluid secretion and cytotoxicity by CDA; similar 
results were obtained with a truncated 16-mer AF peptide.
IN CONCLUSION: peroral CT-treatment induced tolerance to CDA in rat small 
intestine. The tolerance was probably mediated by AF induced via action of 
cholera toxin on the enteric nervous and immune system.
