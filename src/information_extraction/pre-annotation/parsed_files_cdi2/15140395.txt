The antimicrobial susceptibility of 50 Clostridium difficile isolates, 36 of 
them from horse feces and 14 from environmental sites, was determined by broth 
microdilution. The antimicrobial agents tested were avilamycin, cephalothin, 
chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, neomycin, oxacillin, 
oxytetracycline, penicillin, spiramycin, streptomycin, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and virginiamycin. All isolates were 
susceptible to vancomycin (MIC </=1 microg/ml). The MICs of erythromycin, 
oxytetracycline, spiramycin, and virginiamycin showed a bimodal distribution. 
Compared with the majority of isolates, the MICs of erythromycin (MIC > 16 
microg/ml), oxytetracycline (MIC >/=32 microg/ml), spiramycin (MIC > 16 
microg/ml), and virginiamycin (MIC 8-16 microg/ml) were higher for 18 isolates. 
Those were mainly isolated from horses at animal hospitals and further from 
environmental sites at a stud farm. In contrast, all isolates, except one, from 
healthy foals had low MICs of erythromycin, spiramycin, virginiamycin, and 
oxytetracycline. The isolates from soil in public parks had also low MICs of 
these antimicrobial agents. Broth microdilution appeared both reliable and 
reproducible for susceptibility testing of C. difficile. The method was also 
readily performed and the MIC endpoints were easily read.
