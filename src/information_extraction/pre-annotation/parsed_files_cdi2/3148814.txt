The cytopathogenic effect of toxin A from Clostridium difficile was studied in 
cultured human lung fibroblasts. The final effect was dependent on toxin 
concentration and exposure time. Binding of the toxin to cells occurred at 0 
degrees C as well as at 37 degrees C. The latency before appearance of the 
cytopathogenic effect was dose-dependent with a minimum of 45 min. The 
appearance of a cytopathogenic effect in toxin-treated cells was prevented by 
the addition of trypsin, antitoxin, lysosomotropic agents, inhibitors of the 
energy metabolism, 200 mM KCl, 20 mM benzyl alcohol and by incubation at 18 
degrees C. Several inhibitors of lysosomal proteases did not prevent the 
appearance of the cytopathogenic effect. When the extracellular pH was lowered 
to 4.5 for 5 min immediately after toxin binding the period of latency was 
significantly shortened. Likewise, the protective effects of lysosomotropic 
agents were abolished by lowering the extracellular pH. Chinese hamster ovary 
cell mutants, defective in acidification of their endosomes, were less sensitive 
to toxin A than wildtype cells. The results indicate that cellular 
internalisation of toxin A is necessary for intoxication. Moreover, we postulate 
that the toxin needs some sort of enzymatic activation which can take place only 
after exposure of the toxin to a low pH.
