DS-2969b, a novel GyrB inhibitor, transiently and reversibly altered the counts 
of limited intestinal microbiota at around 10 μg/g of faecal levels in rats and 
monkeys. Considering the high activity of DS-2969b against Clostridium 
difficile, 10 μg/g of faecal levels would be sufficient for clearing 
C. difficile from the intestine.
