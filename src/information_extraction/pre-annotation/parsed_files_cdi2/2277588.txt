Nine toxigenic and six non-toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile, of 
varying virulence in the hamster model of antibiotic-associated colitis, were 
examined for the presence of a capsule. Antibody stabilisation of the capsule 
with heterologous and/or homologous antiserum fixed in glutaraldehyde, or direct 
fixation in glutaraldehyde/diamine, were used with added ruthenium red to stain 
the capsular glycocalyx. All strains possessed a capsule which was either 
loose-knit or compact, sometimes with attached globular masses. Better capsule 
preservation was achieved in some strains with glutaraldehyde/diamine/ruthenium 
red fixative than with homologous or heterologous antibody stabilisation. The 
possession of a capsule following in vitro growth does not appear to correlate 
with the virulence status of these strains of C. difficile.
