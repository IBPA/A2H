Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine with several 
biological activities against hematopoietic cells. Recent results indicated that 
IL-11 reduced mucosal damage in animal models of colitis. This study aimed to 
explore the action of recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) on the intestinal 
effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory enterotoxin, and 
cholera toxin, a noninflammatory enterotoxin in rat ileum. We administered 
rhIL-11 subcutaneously to rats before injection of toxin A into ileal loops and 
measured fluid secretion, epithelial permeability to mannitol, histopathological 
damage, and release of rat mast cell protease II (RMCP II) from intestinal mast 
cells and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and macrophage inflammatory 
protein-2 (MIP-2) from lamina propria macrophages. rhIL-11 (50-1,000 
micrograms/kg) inhibited toxin A but not cholera toxin-mediated secretion and 
permeability in a dose-dependent fashion and reduced toxin A-induced epithelial 
cell damage. Rats treated with rhIL-11 also showed reduced RMCP II, TNF-alpha, 
and MIP-2 release in response to toxin A. Exposure of rat peripheral monocytes 
in vitro to rhIL-11 (1 microgram/ml) inhibited lipopolysaccharide and toxin 
A-mediated increases in TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels. We conclude that 
rhIL-11 blocks the intestinal effects of C. difficile toxin A, possibly by 
inhibiting release of inflammatory mediators from mucosal mast cells and 
intestinal macrophages.
