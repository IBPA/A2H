One hundred and seventeen faecal samples from pet dogs (pup = 21 and adult = 96) 
brought for treatment to a veterinary clinic were examined for Clostridium 
difficile. A total of 16 (13.67%) samples were positive. Nine (56.25%) isolates 
were obtained from 17 adult dogs undergoing antibiotic treatment and this was 
significantly higher (p < 0.01) as compared to isolates from dogs without 
antibiotic treatment. Ten isolates (62.5%) were toxigenic (all toxinotype 0) and 
six were non-toxigenic. None of the isolates were positive for binary toxin 
genes. PCR ribotyping revealed three different ribotypes (012, 014 and 046) 
among A(+)B(+) isolates and five different ribotypes (010, SLO 131, and ACD 001 
to ACD 003) among A(-)B(-) isolates. The PFGE analysis of toxigenic isolates 
revealed three different pulsotypes corresponding to the PCR ribotypes.
