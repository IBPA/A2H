A Syrian hamster that had been treated with topical antibiotic ointment for 10 
days following injuries sustained during fighting was presented moribund. 
Postmortem and microscopic examinations revealed lesions consistent with 
clostridial typhlitis and enteritis. Anaerobic culture of caecal contents 
resulted in the isolation of two Clostridium species, and caecal contents 
contained Clostridium difficile enterotoxins. Based on these findings, a 
diagnosis of acute C. difficile enterotoxaemia was made. This report discusses 
the pathogenesis of C. difficile enterotoxaemia and the potential role of 
topical antibiotic ointment therapy in initiating the disease.
