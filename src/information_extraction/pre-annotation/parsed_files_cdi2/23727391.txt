Clostridium difficile is a significant nosocomial threat to human health and is 
the most commonly identified cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The 
development of C. difficile colitis requires production of toxins A and/or B, 
but some strains do not express these proteins. These non-toxigenic C. difficile 
(NTCD) have garnered attention for their capacity to colonize humans and 
potentially reduce the risk for symptomatic colitis caused by toxigenic strains. 
Isolates of NTCD have been obtained from the environment as well as from animal 
and human sources. Studies in a hamster CDI model have demonstrated a protective 
effect of NTCD against toxigenic infection. The extent to which this protective 
effect of NTCD occurs in humans remains to be defined. Evidence for a 
therapeutic or preventive role for NTCD is limited but clinical prophylaxis 
studies are ongoing. NTCD potentially represents an exciting new tool in 
preventing CDI and its recurrences.
