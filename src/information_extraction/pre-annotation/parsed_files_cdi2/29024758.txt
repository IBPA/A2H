Clostridium difficile is an important enteric pathogen in humans causing 
infections in the healthcare environment and the community. Carriage of 
C. difficile and C. difficile-related enterocolitis has been reported in piglets 
worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of C. difficile 
isolation from pigs in Ireland. Faecal samples from piglet litters and sows were 
collected from six farms in 2015. The sows were non-diarrhoeal at the time of 
sampling. The diarrhoeal status of the piglets was unknown. C. difficile was 
isolated from 34/44 (77%) of piglet litter samples and from 33/156 (21%) of sow 
samples. The isolation rate in sows varied from 3 to 39% and in piglet litters 
from 72 to 86% depending on farm location. Toxin A and toxin B were present in 
99% (66/67) of isolates; and binary toxin in 85% (57/67). Only PCR-ribotypes 078 
(88%) and 193 (12%) were identified in piglets. Seven PCR-ribotypes were 
detected in sow C. difficile isolates: PCR-ribotypes 078 (67%), 050 (12%), 
014/020 (6%), 015 (6%), 029 (3%), 035 (3%) and 193 (3%). This study shows that 
toxigenic C. difficile strains such as PCR-ribotype 078 can be commonly isolated 
from pigs at different geographical locations in Ireland. Since PCR-ribotype 078 
is frequently found in humans in Ireland, this highlights the potential for 
interspecies transmission.
