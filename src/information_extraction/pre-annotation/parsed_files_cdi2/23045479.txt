Clostridium difficile toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) induce a pronounced systemic 
and intestinal inflammatory response. A(2B) adenosine receptors (A(2B)ARs) are 
the predominant adenosine receptors in the intestinal epithelium. We 
investigated whether A(2B)ARs are upregulated in human intestinal cells by TcdA 
or TcdB and whether blockade of A(2B)ARs can ameliorate C. difficile 
TcdA-induced enteritis and alter the outcome of C. difficile infection (CDI). 
Adenosine receptor subtype (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) mRNAs were assayed in 
HCT-8 cells. Ileal loops from wild-type rabbits and mice and A(2B)AR(-/-) mice 
were treated with TcdA, with or without the selective A(2B)AR antagonist ATL692 
or PSB1115. A murine model of CDI was used to determine the effect of A(2B)AR 
deletion or blockade with the orally available agent ATL801, on clinical 
outcome, histopathology and intestinal interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression from 
infection. TcdA and TcdB upregulated A(2B)AR gene expression in HCT-8 cells. 
ATL692 decreased TcdA-induced secretion and epithelial injury in rabbit ileum. 
Deletion of A(2B)ARs reduced secretion and histopathology in TcdA-challenged 
mouse ileum. Deletion or blockade of A(2B)ARs reduced histopathology, IL-6 
expression, weight loss, diarrhea, and mortality in C. difficile-infected mice. 
A(2B)ARs mediate C. difficile toxin-induced enteritis and disease. Inhibition of 
A(2B)AR activation may be a potential strategy to limit morbidity and mortality 
from CDI.
