Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile is a gastrointestinal pathogen that 
colonizes the intestinal tract of mammals and can cause severe diarrheal 
disease. Although C. difficile growth is confined to the intestinal tract, our 
understanding of the specific metabolites and host factors that are important 
for the growth of the bacterium is limited. In other enteric pathogens, the 
membrane-derived metabolite, ethanolamine (EA), is utilized as a nutrient source 
and can function as a signal to initiate the production of virulence factors. In 
this study, we investigated the effects of ethanolamine and the role of the 
predicted ethanolamine gene cluster (CD1907-CD1925) on C. difficile growth. 
Using targeted mutagenesis, we disrupted genes within the eut cluster and 
assessed their roles in ethanolamine utilization, and the impact of eut 
disruption on the outcome of infection in a hamster model of disease. Our 
results indicate that the eut gene cluster is required for the growth of C. 
difficile on ethanolamine as a primary nutrient source. Further, the inability 
to utilize ethanolamine resulted in greater virulence and a shorter time to 
morbidity in the animal model. Overall, these data suggest that ethanolamine is 
an important nutrient source within the host and that, in contrast to other 
intestinal pathogens, the metabolism of ethanolamine by C. difficile can delay 
the onset of disease.
