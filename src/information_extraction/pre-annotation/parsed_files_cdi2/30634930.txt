BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a main cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in humans. Several studies have been performed 
to reveal the prevalence rate of C. difficile in cats and dogs. However, little 
is known about the epidemiology of C. difficile in healthy pets in China. This 
study aimed to assess the burden of C. difficile shedding by healthy dogs and 
cats in China. Furthermore, the genetic diversity and antimicrobial 
susceptibility patterns of the recovered isolates were determined.
METHODS: A total of 175 faecal samples were collected from 146 healthy dogs and 
29 cats. C. difficile strains were isolated and identified from the feces of 
these pets. The characterized C. difficile strains were typed by multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST), and the MICs of the isolates were determined against 
ampicillin, clindamycin, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, 
metronidazole and vancomycin by the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Overall, 3 faecal samples (1.7%) were C. difficile culture positive. 
One sample (0.7%) from a dog was C. difficile culture positive, while two cats 
(7.0%) yielded positive cultures. The prevalence rate differed significantly 
between cats and dogs. These isolates were typed into 3 MLST genotypes and were 
susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, metronidazole and moxifloxacin and 
resistant to ampicillin, clindamycin and cefoxitin. Notably, one strain, D141-1, 
which was resistant to three kinds of antibiotics and carried toxin genes, was 
recovered in the faeces of a healthy dog.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that common pets may be a source of pathogenic 
C. difficile, indicating that household transmission of C. difficile from pets 
to humans can not be excluded.
