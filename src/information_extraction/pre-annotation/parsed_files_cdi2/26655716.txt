The epithelial cells of the gut form a physical barrier against the luminal 
contents. The collapse of this barrier causes inflammation, and its therapeutic 
restoration can protect the gut against inflammation. EGF enhances mucosal 
barrier function and increases colonocyte proliferation, thereby ameliorating 
inflammatory responses in the gut. Based on our previous finding that the insect 
peptide CopA3 promotes neuronal growth, we herein tested whether CopA3 could 
increase the cell proliferation of colonocytes, enhance mucosal barrier 
function, and ameliorate gut inflammation. Our results revealed that CopA3 
significantly increased epithelial cell proliferation in mouse colonic crypts 
and also enhanced colonic epithelial barrier function. Moreover, CopA3 treatment 
ameliorated Clostridium difficile toxin As-induced inflammation responses in the 
mouse small intestine (acute enteritis) and completely blocked inflammatory 
responses and subsequent lethality in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse 
model of chronic colitis. The marked CopA3-induced increase of colonocyte 
proliferation was found to require rapid protein degradation of p21(Cip1/Waf1), 
and an in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that CopA3 directly facilitated 
ubiquitin ligase activity against p21(Cip1/Waf1). Taken together, our findings 
indicate that the insect peptide CopA3 prevents gut inflammation by increasing 
epithelial cell proliferation and mucosal barrier function.
