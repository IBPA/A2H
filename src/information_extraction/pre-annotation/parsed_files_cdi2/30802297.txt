Infection with Clostridium difficile is one of the major causes of health care 
acquired diarrhea and colitis. Signaling though MyD88 downstream of TLRs is 
critical for initiating the early protective host response in mouse models of C. 
difficile infection (CDI). In the intestine, MyD88 is expressed in various 
tissues and cell types, such as the intestinal epithelium and mononuclear 
phagocytes (MNP), including DC or macrophages. Using a genetic gain-of-function 
system, we demonstrate here that restricting functional MyD88 signaling to the 
intestinal epithelium, but also to MNPs is sufficient to protect mice during 
acute CDI by upregulation of the intestinal barrier function and recruitment of 
neutrophils. Nevertheless, we also show that mice depleted for CD11c-expressing 
MNPs in the intestine display no major defects in mounting an effective 
inflammatory response, indicating that the absence of these cells is irrelevant 
for inducing host protection during acute infection. Together, our results 
highlight the importance of epithelial-specific MyD88 signaling and demonstrate 
that although functional MyD88 signaling in DC and macrophages alone is 
sufficient to correct the phenotype of MyD88-deficiency, these cells do not seem 
to be essential for host protection in MyD88-sufficient animals during acute 
infection with C. difficile.
