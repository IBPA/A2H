The capability of a recombinant mucin-like fusion protein, P-selectin 
glycoprotein ligand-1/mouse IgG2b (PSGL-1/mIgG2b), carrying Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc 
determinants to bind and inhibit Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) was 
investigated. The fusion protein, produced by a glyco-engineered stable CHO-K1 
cell line and designated C-PGC2, was purified by affinity and gel filtration 
chromatography from large-scale cultures. Liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to characterize O-glycans released by reductive 
β-elimination, and new diagnostic ions to distinguish Galα1,3Gal- from 
Galα1,4Gal-terminated O-glycans were identified. The C-PGC2 cell line, which was 
20-fold more sensitive to TcdA than the wild-type CHO-K1, is proposed as a novel 
cell-based model for TcdA cytotoxicity and neutralization assays. The 
C-PGC2-produced fusion protein could competitively inhibit TcdA binding to 
rabbit erythrocytes, making it a high-efficiency inhibitor of the 
hemagglutination property of TcdA. The fusion protein also exhibited a moderate 
capability for neutralization of TcdA cytotoxicity in both C-PGC2 and CHO-K1 
cells, the former with and the latter without cell surface Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc 
sequences. Future studies in animal models of C. difficile infection will reveal 
its TcdA-inhibitory effect and therapeutic potential in C. difficile-associated 
diseases.
