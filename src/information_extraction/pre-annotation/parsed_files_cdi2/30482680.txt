Clostridium difficile causes increasing numbers of life-threatening intestinal 
infections. Symptoms associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) are mediated 
by secreted protein toxins, whose virulence is modulated by intracellular 
auto-proteolysis following allosteric activation of their protease domains by 
inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Here, we explore the possibility of 
inactivating the C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) by triggering its auto-proteolysis 
in the gut lumen prior to cell uptake using gain-of-function small molecules. We 
anticipated that high calcium concentrations typically found in the gut would 
strongly chelate IP6, precluding it from pre-emptively inducing toxin 
auto-proteolysis if administered exogenously. We therefore designed IP6 analogs 
with reduced susceptibility to complexation by calcium, which maintained 
allosteric activity at physiological calcium concentrations. We found that oral 
administration of IP6 analogs attenuated inflammation and promoted survival in 
mouse models of CDI. Our data provide impetus to further develop small-molecule 
allosteric triggers of toxin auto-proteolysis as a therapeutic strategy.
