A study of Clostridium difficile diversity in pigs, calves and horses in 
Slovenia was conducted. A total of 547 samples were collected and C. difficile 
was isolated from 247/485 (50.9%) piglet samples, from 4/42 (9.5%) calf samples, 
and 1/20 (5%) horse samples. The isolates were characterized by toxinotyping, 
PCR-ribotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using restriction 
endonuclease SmaI. Piglet isolates belonged to two toxinotypes (V and 0), four 
PCR-ribotypes (066, 029, SI 011, SI 010), and six pulsotypes. Bovine isolates 
were grouped into two toxinotypes (XIa and 0), three PCR-ribotypes (077, 002, 
033), and three pulsotypes. The only equine isolate was indistinguishable from 
one calf isolate (XIa/033) in toxinotype, PCR-ribotype, and pulsotype. None of 
detected genotypes was present in all three animal hosts.
