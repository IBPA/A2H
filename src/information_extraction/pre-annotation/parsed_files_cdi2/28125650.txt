Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) are a leading cause of nosocomial 
diarrhea in the developed world. The main virulence factors of the bacterium are 
the large clostridial toxins (LCTs), TcdA and TcdB, which are largely 
responsible for the symptoms of the disease. Recent outbreaks of CDI have been 
associated with the emergence of hypervirulent strains, such as NAP1/BI/027, 
many strains of which also produce a third toxin, binary toxin (CDTa and CDTb). 
These hypervirulent strains have been associated with increased morbidity and 
higher mortality. Here we present pre-clinical data describing a novel 
tetravalent vaccine composed of attenuated forms of TcdA, TcdB and binary toxin 
components CDTa and CDTb. We demonstrate, using the Syrian golden hamster model 
of CDI, that the inclusion of binary toxin components CDTa and CDTb 
significantly improves the efficacy of the vaccine against challenge with NAP1 
strains in comparison to vaccines containing only TcdA and TcdB antigens, while 
providing comparable efficacy against challenge with the prototypic, 
non-epidemic strain VPI10463. This combination vaccine elicits high neutralizing 
antibody titers against TcdA, TcdB and binary toxin in both hamsters and rhesus 
macaques. Finally we present data that binary toxin alone can act as a virulence 
factor in animal models. Taken together, these data strongly support the 
inclusion of binary toxin in a vaccine against CDI to provide enhanced 
protection from epidemic strains of C. difficile.
