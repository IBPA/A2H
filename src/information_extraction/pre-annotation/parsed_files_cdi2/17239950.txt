Clostridium difficile is a common nosocomial pathogen in humans and animals that 
causes diarrhea and colitis following antibiotic therapy. Isolates of C. 
difficile obtained from faecal material from 20 human patients and 6 equine 
subjects with antibiotic-associated diarrhea were investigated regarding 
production of toxins A and B, their capacity to adhere to the human intestinal 
Caco-2 cell line and equine intestinal cells, and for the presence of fimbriae. 
The results showed that most (17/20) of the human clinical isolates produced 
both toxins A and B. One of the human isolates proved toxin A-negative/toxin 
B-positive. All (6/6) horse isolates were positive for both toxins A and B. Both 
the human and horse isolates possessed the capacity to adhere, to varying 
degree, to human and equine intestinal cells. It appeared that human isolates 
produced greater amounts of toxin B, and that there was a host-species 
dependency on ability to attach to intestinal epithelial cells. No fimbriae were 
found in any of the investigated isolates.
