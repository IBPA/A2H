The process of internalisation of Clostridium difficile toxin B into human lung 
fibroblasts was further studied, with the aim of elucidating the fate of 
endocytosed toxin. Development of the toxin-induced cytopathogenic effect was 
reversibly inhibited at 18 degrees C and in the presence of 200 mM KCl or 1-20 
mM benzyl alcohol, i.e. at conditions when the fusion between endosomes and 
lysosomes is prevented. Fibroblasts treated with toxin at 37 degrees C but 
transferred to 18 degrees C within 10 min were also completely protected, 
whereas transfer to 18 degrees C later during the latency resulted in only 
partial protection. KCl was also protective upon addition after the toxin 
binding step. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases, such as chymostatin, leupeptin 
and antipain, prevented the appearance of the cytopathogenic effect, when 
present during toxin exposure or added after the toxin binding step. Chinese 
hamster ovary cell mutants, defective in acidification of their endosomes, were 
resistant to toxin B, whereas wildtype cells were sensitive. The resistance was 
not overcome by applying a low extracellular pH. The results suggest that 
exposure to a low pH compartment is necessary but not sufficient for entry of 
active toxin B to the cytosol. In addition to a low pH, a fusion of 
toxin-containing endosomes with lysosomes and a further processing of the toxin 
by lysosomal proteases is required for cellular intoxication.
