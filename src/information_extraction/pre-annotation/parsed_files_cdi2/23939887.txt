Nontoxigenic Clostridium difficile (NTCD) has been shown to prevent fatal C. 
difficile infection in the hamster model when hamsters are challenged with 
standard toxigenic C. difficile strains. The purpose of this study was to 
determine if NTCD can prevent C. difficile infection in the hamster model when 
hamsters are challenged with restriction endonuclease analysis group BI C. 
difficile strains. Groups of 10 hamsters were given oral clindamycin, followed 
on day 2 by 10(6) CFU of spores of NTCD strain M3 or T7, and were challenged on 
day 5 with 100 CFU of spores of BI1 or BI6. To conserve animals, results for 
control hamsters challenged with BI1 or BI6 from the present study and controls 
from previous identical experiments were combined for statistical comparisons. 
NTCD strains M3 and T7 achieved 100% colonization and were 100% protective 
against challenge with BI1 (P â‰¤ 0.001). M3 colonized 9/10 hamsters and protected 
against BI6 challenge in the colonized hamsters (P = 0.0003). T7 colonized 10/10 
hamsters, but following BI6 challenge, cocolonization occurred in 5 hamsters, 4 
of which died, for protection of 6/10 animals (P = 0.02). NTCD colonization 
provides protection against challenge with toxigenic BI group strains. M3 is 
more effective than T7 in preventing C. difficile infection caused by the BI6 
epidemic strain. Prevention of C. difficile infection caused by the epidemic BI6 
strain may be more challenging than that of infections caused by historic BI1 
and non-BI C. difficile strains.
