Foodborne ingestion through pork products of Clostridium difficile has been 
suggested a possible route of transmission of C difficile from pigs to humans. 
To determine whether C. difficile bacteria are present in the intestines of 
slaughter pigs, rectum contents of 677 slaughter pigs from 52 farms were 
collected at the slaughterhouse. Data on farm specific factors were collected 
and the association of these factors with the presence of C. difficile in pig 
herds from 39 farms was assessed. The prevalence of C. difficile and the 
ribotypical diversity that were found in this study were much higher than 
previously reported in literature, with an overall C. difficile prevalence of 
8.6% (58/677). Sixteen distinct C. difficile ribotypes were identified, 
predominantly type 078 (31.0%, 18/58). This type is also commonly found in 
humans with C. difficile infection (CDI). Both on individual pig level and on 
herd level, no significant difference between the prevalence of C. difficile in 
pigs derived from conventional or organic farming types was detected. Farm 
system, size, and presence of other animal species on the farm did not result in 
significant different prevalences of C. difficile.
