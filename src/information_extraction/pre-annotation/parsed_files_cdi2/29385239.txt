BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile (CD) infection (CDI) increases patient 
morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Antibiotic treatment induces gut 
dysbiosis and is both a major risk factor for CD colonization and treatment of 
CDI. Probiotics have been trialed to support commensal gut microbiota and reduce 
CDI. This study investigated commensal microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (FP) 
and a prebiotic, both known to yield butyrate and be anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory, on CD colonization and gut integrity in mice.
METHODS: Mice were randomly grouped and supplemented daily with FP, prebiotic, 
FP + prebiotic, FP/prebiotic supernatant, or saline throughout the entire study. 
Following treatment with clindamycin for 3 days, mice were exposed to CD. Feces 
were collected at baseline, the day after antibiotic, and 1, 3, and 5 days after 
CD exposure and cultured for bacterial overgrowth and CD colonization. On days 1 
and 5 after CD exposure, mice were randomly euthanized, and proximal colon was 
dissected for histological analysis and preparation of RNA for analysis of 
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
RESULTS: Although all mice exhibited bacterial overgrowth and CD colonization, 
bacterial burden resolved quicker in the FP + prebiotic group. This was 
associated with induction and resolution of innate immune responses, anion 
exchanger, and tight junction protein preservation in proximal colon. CD toxin 
virulence potential was questionable as expression of CD toxin B receptor was 
depleted in the FP + prebiotic group.
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with anti-inflammatory butyrate-supporting commensal 
bacteria and prebiotic may support innate immune responses and minimize 
bacterial burden and negative effects during antibiotic and CD exposure.
