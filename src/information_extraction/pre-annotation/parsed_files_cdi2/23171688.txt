A total of 250 fecal content samples were collected from 25 farrow-to-finish pig 
farms and examined for the prevalence of Clostridium difficile by using ethanol 
treatment followed by plating onto selective 
media--cycloserine-cefoxitin-mannitol agar--for the isolation of Clostridium 
difficile. Two specimens (0.8%, 95% confidential interval: 0-2.9%) were positive 
for C. difficile. One isolate was only positive for toxin B, and the other 
isolate was negative for both toxins A and B. Thus, prevalence of Clostridium 
difficile was found to be low among finishing pigs in Japan.
