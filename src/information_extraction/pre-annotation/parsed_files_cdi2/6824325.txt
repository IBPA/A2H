The mouse lethality test is the most sensitive method for confirming the 
diagnosis of infant botulism. Both Clostridium difficile and Clostridium 
botulinum produce heat-labile toxins which are lethal for mice and can be found 
in the feces of infants. These two toxins can be distinguished from one another 
in this assay when both are present in the same fecal specimen because they 
appear to be immunologically distinct toxins.
