Clostridium difficile toxin A is known to cause deacetylation of tubulin 
proteins, which blocks microtubule formation and triggers barrier dysfunction in 
the gut. Based on our previous finding that the Clostridium difficile toxin 
A-dependent activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC-6) is responsible for 
tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule disassembly, we herein examined 
the possible effect of potassium acetate (PA; whose acetyl group prevents the 
binding of tubulin to HDAC-6) as a competitive/false substrate. Our results 
revealed that PA inhibited toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin and 
recovered toxin A-induced microtubule disassembly. In addition, PA treatment 
significantly decreased the production of IL-6 (a marker of inflamed tissue) in 
the toxin A-induced mouse enteritis model. An in vitro HDAC assay revealed that 
PA directly inhibited HDAC-6-mediated tubulin deacetylation, indicating that PA 
acted as a false substrate for HDAC-6. These results collectively indicate that 
PA treatment inhibits HDAC-6, thereby reducing the cytotoxicity and inflammatory 
responses caused by C. difficile toxin A.
