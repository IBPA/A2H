Clostridium difficile is responsible for a wide spectrum of infection from 
asymptomatic carriage to severe, relapsing colitis. Since 2003, C. difficile 
infections have increased with a higher morbidity and mortality due to the 
emergence of epidemic and hypervirulent C. difficile strains such as those of 
the epidemic lineage 027/BI/NAP1. To decipher the hypervirulence and epidemicity 
of 027 strains, we analyzed gene expression profiles of the R20291 027 strain 
using a monoxenic mouse model during the first 38h of infection. A total of 741 
genes were differentially expressed during the course of infection. They are 
mainly distributed in functional categories involved in host adaptation. Several 
genes of PTS and ABC transporters were significantly regulated during the 
infection, underlying the ability of strain R20291 to adapt its metabolism 
according to nutrient availability in the digestive tract. In this animal model, 
despite the early sporulation process, sporulation efficiency seems to indicate 
that growth of R20291 vegetative cells versus spores were favored during 
infection. The bacterial mechanisms associated to adaptability and flexibility 
within the gut environment, in addition to the virulence factor expression and 
antibiotic resistance, should contribute to the epidemicity and hypervirulence 
of the C. difficile 027 strains.
