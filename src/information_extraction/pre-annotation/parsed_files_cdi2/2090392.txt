The major change in the ultrastructure of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
treated with Clostridium difficile enterotoxin A was the formation of bundles of 
filaments in the nucleoplasm. The filaments appeared after 2.5 h and disappeared 
by the fourth hour of incubation with the toxin. To partially characterize these 
filaments, laser diffractometry and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry were 
employed. The bundles consist of coiled filaments of about 11 nm and 16 nm 
diameter and a main long axial periodicity of about 26 nm. Postembedding 
immunogold labelling with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that these 
intranuclear filaments are comprised mainly of actin, but also contain lamin and 
vinculin. Between 2.5 and 3 h of incubation with enterotoxin A, the lamins were 
located close to the nuclear envelope, but they were also consistently found 
scattered in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Such an unusual distribution of 
lamins might mediate the adverse effects of enterotoxin A on nuclear 
organization and function and thus cause the eventual death of CHO cells.
