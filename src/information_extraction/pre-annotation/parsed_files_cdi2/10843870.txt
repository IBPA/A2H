Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
is upregulated in arterial injury and plays a role in regulating VSMC 
proliferation and restenosis. Inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1beta 
(IL-1beta)] released during vascular injury induce iNOS. Small GTP-binding 
proteins of the Ras superfamily play a major role in IL-1beta-dependent 
signaling pathways. In this study, we examined the role of Rho GTPases in 
regulating iNOS expression in VSMCs. Treatment of VSMCs with mevastatin, which 
inhibits isoprenylation of Rho and other small GTP-binding proteins, produced 
significantly higher amounts of IL-1beta-evoked NO and iNOS protein compared 
with control. Similarly, bacterial toxins [Toxin B from Clostridium difficile 
and C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (C3) toxin from Clostridium botulinium] that 
specifically inactivate Rho proteins increased NOS products (NO and citrulline) 
and iNOS expression. Toxin B increased the activity of iNOS promoter-reporter 
construct in VSMCs. Both toxins enhanced IL-1beta-stimulated iNOS expression and 
NO production. These data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of Rho 
induces iNOS and suggest a role for Rho protein in IL-1beta-stimulated NO 
production in VSMCs.
