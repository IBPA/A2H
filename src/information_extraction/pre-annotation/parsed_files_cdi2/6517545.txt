Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast used in a number of countries for general and 
antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal illnesses, was examined for possible 
application in the prevention of clindamycin-induced mortality in the hamster 
colitis model. Hamsters were given free access to an aqueous 5% suspension of 
lyophilized yeast for 3 days before and 10 days after administration of a single 
oral clindamycin dose of from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg. Mortality was recorded in groups 
of 7 to 20 animals every 24 h for 10 to 30 days. Mean cecal concentrations of S. 
boulardii were greater than 10(6) CFU/ml throughout the yeast administration 
period. Yeast treatment significantly decreased cumulative percent mortality by 
an average of 29%. Death onset was not affected by yeast treatment. Cecitis was 
present in 86% of moribund animals (N = 95) and was absent in all surviving 
animals examined (N = 27). Toxigenic Clostridium difficile was isolated from 13 
of 14 moribund hamsters examined. No adverse effects of the yeast treatment were 
observed in animals receiving S. boulardii without clindamycin. The results 
suggest that S. boulardii warrants further evaluation for the prevention of 
antibiotic-associated colitis.
