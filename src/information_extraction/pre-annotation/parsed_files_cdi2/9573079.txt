Clostridium difficile toxin A binds nonspecifically to a mouse monoclonal 
antibody (MAb) immunoglobulin G3 lambda chain [IgG3(lambda)], through the Fab 
component. This binding, which is retained even after boiling the MAb, is 
temperature dependent, with more toxin bound at 4 than 37 degrees C (P = 
0.0024). The nonspecific binding was decreased by incubation of the IgG3 lambda 
MAb with alpha- or beta-galactosidase (P = 0.0001 and 0.029, respectively), 
indicating that toxin A binds to a carbohydrate moiety on the Fab. However, 
binding was not blocked by the Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin BS-1, indicating 
that a terminal alpha-galactose may not be involved. Binding was also not 
affected by competitive assays with Lewis X antigen. The dependence on 
carbohydrate moieties in nonspecific binding was also shown for two other MAbs, 
IgA(kappa) and IgM(lambda), with demonstration of a significant reduction in 
binding with alpha-galactosidase (P = 0.0001 and 0.0002, respectively) but not 
beta-galactosidase (P = 0.27 and 0.25, respectively).
