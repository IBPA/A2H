The spore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile represents the principal cause 
of hospital-acquired diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis worldwide. C. 
difficile infection (CDI) is mediated by 2 bacterial toxins, A and B; 
neutralizing these toxins with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provides a potential 
nonantibiotic strategy for combating the rising prevalence, severity, and 
recurrence of CDI. Novel antitoxin mAbs were generated in mice and were 
humanized. The humanized antitoxin A mAb PA-50 and antitoxin B mAb PA-41 have 
picomolar potencies in vitro and bind to novel regions of the respective toxins. 
In a hamster model for CDI, 95% of animals treated with a combination of 
humanized PA-50 and PA-41 showed long-term survival relative to 0% survival of 
animals treated with standard antibiotics or comparator mAbs. These humanized 
mAbs provide insight into C. difficile intoxication and hold promise as 
potential nonantibiotic agents for improving clinical management of CDI.
