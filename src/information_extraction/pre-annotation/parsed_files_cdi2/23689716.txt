The novel antibiotic MBX-500, dosed at 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg twice daily for 7 
days, was evaluated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 
in the gnotobiotic pig model. MBX-500 increased survival at all doses and at 
high doses improved clinical signs and reduced lesion severity, similar to 
vancomycin. Our results show that MBX-500 is an effective antibiotic for the 
treatment of diarrhea associated with CDI and prevents severe systemic disease.
