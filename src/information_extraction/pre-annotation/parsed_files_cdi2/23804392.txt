Cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (CCFA), CCFA with horse blood and 
taurocholate (CCFA-HT), and cycloserine-cefoxitin mannitol broth with 
taurocholate and lysozyme (CCMB-TAL) were compared for recovery of Clostridium 
difficile from 120 stool specimens. Compared to CCFA, CCFA-HT enhanced C. 
difficile growth and improved recovery by 4%. In a separate study, 9% (8/91) of 
stool samples previously C. difficile negative on plate medium were C. difficile 
positive when cultured in CCMB-TAL.
