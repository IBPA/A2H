The efficacy of oral tigecycline treatment (2 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days) 
of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was evaluated in the gnotobiotic pig 
model, and its effect on human gut microflora transplanted into the gnotobiotic 
pig was determined. Tigecycline oral treatment improved survival, clinical 
signs, and lesion severity and markedly decreased concentrations of Firmicutes 
but did not promote CDI. Our data showed that oral tigecycline treatment has a 
potential beneficial effect on the treatment of CDI.
