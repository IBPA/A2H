Analysis of crude culture filtrate of Clostridium difficile by Mono Q-anion 
exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) demonstrated that toxin A had 
distinct peaks of activity for cytotoxicity and haemagglutination, as also did 
highly purified toxin A obtained by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography (TG) 
followed by two sequential anion-exchange chromatographic steps with Q-Sepharose 
FF and Mono Q. From TG unbound fractions a highly cytotoxic but weakly 
haemagglutinating variant (toxin A') of toxin A was obtained by Q-Sepharose FF 
and Mono Q chromatography. Analysis of toxins A and A' from cultures of C. 
difficile in a chemically defined medium, and of toxin A dialysed against brain 
heart infusion broth, indicated that A' was not merely toxin A coupled to a 
component of the growth medium. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under 
non-denaturing conditions showed that toxins A and A' had the same Mr. 
Immunoblotting with mouse monospecific A antitoxin showed that five bands larger 
than the major 240-Kda band were more strongly developed in toxin A than in A' 
in denaturing but non-reducing conditions, and in reducing conditions eight 
bands (38-175 Kda) were seen in toxin A but not A'. Immunoblotting with a 
monoclonal antibody (PCG-4) showed that, in both reducing and non-reducing 
conditions, two bands of 160 and 155 Kda were more prominent in toxins A and A' 
respectively, and four bands (195, 180, 175 and 125 Kda) were detected only in 
toxin A'.
