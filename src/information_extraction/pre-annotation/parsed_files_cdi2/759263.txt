Toxins produced by Clostridium difficile have been implicated in the etiology of 
antibiotic-induced colitis. Clostridium difficile antitoxin is not available, 
but recent studies have shown that toxins present in the feces of patients with 
this disease are neutralized by Clostridium sordellii antitoxin. We found that 
C. sordellii antitoxin neutralized toxins produced in broth cultures of either 
C. sordellii or C. difficile and that passive immunization with C. sordellii 
antitoxin before challenge with clindamycin prevented colitis in hamsters. 
Significantly fewer antitoxin-treated animals than unimmunized controls 
developed diarrhea and died with hemorrhagic colitis. Administration of 300 U of 
antitoxin parenterally either on the day of challenge with clindamycin or 24 hr 
later provided significant protection (25% mortality vs. 100% mortality in 
controls, P less than 0.01). None of eight animals given antitoxin (300 U) both 
on the day of challenge and 24 hr later died. Filtrates prepared from cecal 
contents of dead or killed hamsters were tested for toxicity by intraperitoneal 
injection into hamsters and by addition to monolayers of monkey kidney cells. 
Fecal filtrates from antitoxin-protected animals were not toxic in these assays, 
but filtrates from control animals were uniformly toxic. Passive immunization 
against clostridial toxins was protective against clindamycin-associated colitis 
in this model. This finding further substantiates the importance of these toxins 
in the pathogenesis of antibiotic-induced colitis.
