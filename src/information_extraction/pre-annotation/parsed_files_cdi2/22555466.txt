Models of Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile) have been used 
extensively for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) research. The hamster model 
of C. difficile infection has been most extensively employed for the study of C. 
difficile and this has been used in many different areas of research, including 
the induction of C. difficile, the testing of new treatments, population 
dynamics and characterization of virulence. Investigations using in vitro models 
for C. difficile introduced the concept of colonization resistance, evaluated 
the role of antibiotics in C. difficile development, explored population 
dynamics and have been useful in the evaluation of C. difficile treatments. 
Experiments using models have major advantages over clinical studies and have 
been indispensible in furthering C. difficile research. It is important for 
future study programs to carefully consider the approach to use and therefore be 
better placed to inform the design and interpretation of clinical studies.
