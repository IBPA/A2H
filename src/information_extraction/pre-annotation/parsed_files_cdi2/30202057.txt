Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in treating recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Bacterial colonization in recipients 
after FMT has been studied, but little is known about the role of the gut fungal 
community, or mycobiota. Here, we show evidence of gut fungal dysbiosis in CDI, 
and that donor-derived fungal colonization in recipients is associated with FMT 
response. CDI is accompanied by over-representation of Candida albicans and 
decreased fungal diversity, richness, and evenness. Cure after FMT is associated 
with increased colonization of donor-derived fungal taxa in recipients. 
Recipients of successful FMT ("responders") display, after FMT, a high relative 
abundance of Saccharomyces and Aspergillus, whereas "nonresponders" and 
individuals treated with antibiotics display a dominant presence of Candida. 
High abundance of C. albicans in donor stool also correlates with reduced FMT 
efficacy. Furthermore, C. albicans reduces FMT efficacy in a mouse model of CDI, 
while antifungal treatment reestablishes its efficacy, supporting a potential 
causal relationship between gut fungal dysbiosis and FMT outcome.
