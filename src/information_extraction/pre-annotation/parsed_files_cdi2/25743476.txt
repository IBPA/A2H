Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous 
colitis mainly through two exotoxins TcdA and TcdB that target intestinal 
epithelial cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in regulating 
intestinal inflammatory responses. In the current study, we explored the 
interaction of TcdB-intoxicated epithelial cells with mouse bone marrow-derived 
DCs. TcdB induced cell death and heat shock protein translocation in mouse 
intestinal epithelial CT26 cells. The intoxicated epithelial cells promoted the 
phagocytosis and the TNF-α secretion by DCs. Incubation with TcdB-intoxicated 
CT26 cells stimulated DC maturation. Moreover, TcdB-treated CT26 cells induced 
DC immigration when they were injected into mice subcutaneously. Taken together, 
these data demonstrate that TcdB-intoxicated intestinal epithelial cells are 
able to stimulate DC activation in vitro and attract DCs in vivo, indicating 
that epithelial cells may be able to regulate DC activation under the exposure 
of TcdB during C. difficile infection.
