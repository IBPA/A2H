A toxin produced by Clostridium difficile has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated colitis in humans and experimental 
animals. This study was undertaken in order to define the sequential evolution 
of caecal mucosal lesions in the hamster and to relate those lesions directly to 
the clostridial toxin. Sterile filtrates from a culture of C. difficile and from 
caecal contents of clindamycin-treated hamsters were studied with respect to 
their effects on the caecal mucosa and on cultured cell monolayers. The toxic 
filtrates both produced cellular swelling in vitro, and appeared to have a 
similar cytotoxic effect on caecal epithelial cells in vivo. Cellular damage was 
followed by extensive epithelial desquamation and the evolution of an acute 
pseudomembranous typhlitis. The pathogenetic sequence produced by the filtrates 
was identical with that previously described after direct clindamycin treatment. 
These findings demonstrate that intraluminal clostridial toxin can mediate 
development of the characteristic antibiotic-associated mucosal lesions.
