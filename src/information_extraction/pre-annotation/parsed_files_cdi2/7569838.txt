In order to ascertain the importance of Campylobacter spp., C.difficile, 
C.perfringens and Salmonella as agents of bacterial gastroenteritis in dogs, two 
groups of animals were studied prospectively. The first group consisted of 77 
puppies in 14 litters, with fecal cultures performed weekly for 10 weeks, 
starting at birth. The second group consisted of a kennel population with every 
dog cultured at entry, and at two-month intervals thereafter. Incidence of 
Campylobacter spp. was 32 and 31 per 100 dog-month of observation for healthy 
pups and healthy adult dogs respectively, 46 and 0 for C.difficile, 51 and 36 
for C.perfringens and 6.5 and 1.3 for Salmonella. The incidence of Campylobacter 
spp. in pups peaked at 8 weeks of age. This incidence (43 per 100 dog-months) 
was higher in pups reared together with older dogs than in pups reared without 
contact to other dogs (0 per 100 dog-months). Toxigenic strains of C.difficile 
were found in 61.5% of the healthy neonate dogs. None of the cases of non-watery 
and non-inflammatory diarrhea we observed was associated with any of the 
pathogens studied. Furthermore newly acquired colonization with Campylobacter 
spp. or Salmonella was never associated with episodes of diarrhea. No 
conclusions could be drawn about the role of bacterial pathogens for causation 
of watery or inflammatory diarrhea which were not observed in our study.
