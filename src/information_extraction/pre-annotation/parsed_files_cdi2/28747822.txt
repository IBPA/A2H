Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the main cause of hospital-acquired 
diarrhea that can cause colitis or even death. The medical-treatment cost and 
deaths caused by CDI are increasing annually worldwide. New approaches for 
prevention and treatment of these infections are needed, such as the use of 
probiotics. Probiotics, including Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus, are 
microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when administered in 
adequate amounts. The effect of Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 on infectious 
disease caused by C. difficile 027 was investigated in a mouse model. The 
survival rates for mice given the pathogen alone, and with live cells, or dead 
cells of B. longum were 40, 70, and 60%, respectively. In addition, the 
intestinal tissues of the B. longum-treated group maintained structural 
integrity with some degree of damage. These findings suggested that B. longum 
ATCC 15707 has a function in repressing the infectious disease caused by C. 
difficile 027.
