Clostridium difficile toxin A was evaluated for an antitumor effect in vivo on 
HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. A mean 
reduction in tumor volume of at least 65%, by measurement in three dimensions, 
was observed in mice who received two 9- to 13-day courses of daily 
intraperitoneal injections of toxin A as compared to mice receiving diluent 
alone. Reversible adverse effects of toxin A were noted in some animals, 
consisting primarily of liver toxicity and skin rash. HCT 116 cells in toxin 
A-treated mice grew as flattened tumors with ulcerated centers compared to 
rounded tumors without ulceration in controls. Histologic examination of tumors 
from representative mice revealed that two thirds of the tumor in a treated 
mouse was necrotic compared to only one third in a control, suggesting greater 
antitumor efficacy of toxin A than estimated by tumor measurements alone.
