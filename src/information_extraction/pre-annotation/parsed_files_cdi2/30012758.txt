Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and has gained worldwide notoriety due to 
emerging hypervirulent strains and the high incidence of recurrence. We 
previously reported protection of mice from CDI using the antigerminant bile 
salt analog CamSA. Here we describe the effects of CamSA in the hamster model of 
CDI. CamSA treatment of hamsters showed no toxicity and did not affect the 
richness or diversity of gut microbiota; however, minor changes in community 
composition were observed. Treatment of C. difficile-challenged hamsters with 
CamSA doubled the mean time to death, compared to control hamsters. However, 
CamSA alone was insufficient to prevent CDI in hamsters. CamSA in conjunction 
with suboptimal concentrations of vancomycin led to complete protection from CDI 
in 70% of animals. Protected animals remained disease-free at least 30 days 
postchallenge and showed no signs of colonic tissue damage. In a 
delayed-treatment model of hamster CDI, CamSA was unable to prevent infection 
signs and death. These data support a putative model in which CamSA reduces the 
number of germinating C. difficile spores but does not keep all of the spores 
from germinating. Vancomycin halts division of any vegetative cells that are 
able to grow from spores that escape CamSA.
