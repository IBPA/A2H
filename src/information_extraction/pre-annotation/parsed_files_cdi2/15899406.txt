Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and 
the primary cause of pseudomembraneous colitis in hospitalised patients. We 
assessed the protective effect of anti-surface layer protein (SLP) antibodies on 
C. difficile infection in a lethal hamster challenge model. Post-challenge 
survival was significantly prolonged in the anti-SLP treated group compared with 
control groups (P=0.0281 and P=0.0283). The potential mechanism of action of the 
antiserum was shown to be through enhancement of C. difficile phagocytosis. This 
report indicates that anti-SLP antibodies can modulate the course of C. 
difficile infection and may therefore merit closer investigation for use as 
constituents of multi-component vaccines against C. difficile associated 
diarrhoea.
