Clostridium difficile was incriminated by Hughes and Jarvis (1987) as a cause of 
intestinal infections in USA in the 1980-1984 period in 45 p. 100 of cases, 
whereas Salmonellae only in 12 p. 100. Four strains of this organism are studied 
in this paper in comparison with ten strains of C. bifermentans and six of C. 
sordellii, because the three species share a common antigen and have other 
common characteristics, as well. However, spores of C. difficile swell the 
bacteria and those of other bacteria (C. bifermentans and C. sordellii) do not; 
C. difficile does not produce indole, whereas the other species produce it. We 
confirmed the selective capacity of the medium of George et al. (1979) using the 
"alcohol shock" and as selective agents cycloserine D and cefoxitin. C. 
difficile proved to be most susceptible to metronidazole and rifampin. Whereas 
the former antibiotic was considered as a cause of post-antibiotic intestinal 
infections by different authors, the second was not, to our knowledge. The 
strain 10463 has a considerable toxicity (1000 DLM/ml for the white mouse, and 
pathogenicity--2000--5000 DCL for the white mouse, as compared to 25 DCL of the 
other three strains). Using this toxin an antitoxic serum was obtained in horse, 
with a capacity of neutralizing the action of the toxin up to a dilution of 1 p. 
1000.
