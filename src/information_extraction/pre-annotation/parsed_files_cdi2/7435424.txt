Vancomycin protects hamsters from the development of Clostridium difficile 
colitis after treatment with clindamycin, and vancomycin is useful in treatment 
of humans with the disease. Relapses have occurred in both hamsters and humans 
when vancomycin is discontinued. Vancomycin appears to enhance susceptibility to 
colonization with C. difficile by eliminating competing intestinal organisms. 
The nature of these organisms is not known, but various tools are now available 
to aid in identifying them. Cancer chemotherapeutic agents should be added to 
the list of factors such as surgery and antibiotics that may predispose to 
emergence of C. difficile. The number of organisms required for colonization of 
antibiotic-treated hamsters is low and cross-infection seems to play a role in 
the disease in hamster colonies. The organism can be detected on surfaces in 
rooms of patients with the disease, and on the hands of personnel caring for 
them. Outbreaks of the disease have been recognized. Our results suggest 
isolation precautions should be used to prevent spread of the organism from 
patients with the disease to others being treated with antibiotics.
