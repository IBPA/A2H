RhoB is the only member of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases, which is 
classified as an immediate early gene product. RhoB is up-regulated in response 
to growth factors as well as cytotoxic and genotoxic agents. Clostridial 
glucosylating toxins have been reported to evoke pronounced RhoB expression, 
based on the inactivation of Rho/Ras proteins. In this study, we report on a 
long lasting expression of RhoB in cultured cells upon activation of Rho 
proteins by the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli. The 
observations of this study highlight a new pathway involving Rac1, which 
positively regulates the activity of the rhoB promoter and RhoB expression. 
Conversely, the isomeric cytotoxic necrotizing factor from Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis (CNFy) drives GTP-loading of basal RhoB but fails to cause 
activation of the rhoB promoter and thus its expression. CNF1 inhibits 
cytokinesis and induces the formation of bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells. Upon 
long term treatment with CNF1, RhoB(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
exhibit DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and loss of membrane 
integrity, while RhoB(+/-) MEFs persist as bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells 
without any signs of cell death. In conclusion, the cytoprotective RhoB response 
is not only evoked by bacterial protein toxins inactivating Rho/Ras proteins but 
also by the Rac1-activating toxin CNF1.
