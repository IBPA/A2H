Clostridium difficile in one of the most commonly reported nosocomial pathogens 
worldwide. Beyond antibiotic use, little is known about the host, microbiota, 
and environmental factors that contribute to susceptibility to and severity of 
C. difficile infection (CDI). We recently observed that in a mouse model of CDI, 
excess dietary zinc (Zn) alters the gut microbiota and decreases resistance to 
CDI. Moreover, we determined that high levels of Zn exacerbate C. 
difficile-associated disease and calprotectin-mediated Zn limitation is an 
essential host response to infection. In this addendum, we discuss how these 
findings add to our understanding of CDI and consider the potential implications 
of excess metal intake on the microbiota and infection.
