LFF571 is a novel semisynthetic thiopeptide antibiotic with potent activity 
against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens, including Clostridium difficile. 
In vivo efficacy of LFF571 was compared to vancomycin in a hamster model of C. 
difficile infection (CDI). Infection was induced in Golden Syrian hamsters using 
a toxigenic strain of C. difficile. Treatment started 24 h postinfection and 
consisted of saline, vancomycin, or LFF571. Cox regression was used to analyze 
survival data from a cohort of animals evaluated across seven serial 
experimental groups treated with vancomycin at 20 mg/kg, LFF571 at 5 mg/kg, or 
vehicle alone. Survival was right censored; animals were not observed beyond day 
21. At death or end of study, cecal contents were tested for C. difficile toxins 
A and B. In summary, the data showed that 5 mg/kg LFF571 decreased the risk of 
death by 79% (P < 0.0001) and 69% (P = 0.0022) compared with saline and 20 mg/kg 
vancomycin, respectively. Further analysis of the pooled data indicated that the 
survival benefit of LFF571 treatment at 5 mg/kg compared to vancomycin at 20 
mg/kg was due primarily to a decrease in the risk of recurrence after end of 
treatment. Animals successfully treated with LFF571 or vancomycin had no 
detectable C. difficile toxin. Overall, LFF571 was more efficacious at the end 
of the study, at a lower dose, and with fewer recurrences, than vancomycin in 
the hamster model of CDI. LFF571 is being assessed in humans for safety and 
efficacy in the treatment of C. difficile infections.
