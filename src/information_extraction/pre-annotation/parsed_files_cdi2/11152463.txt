Clostridium difficile toxin B (269 kDa), which is one of the causative agents of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, inactivates Rho 
GTPases by glucosylation. Here we studied the uptake and membrane interaction of 
the toxin with eukaryotic target cells. Bafilomycin A1, which prevents 
acidification of endosomal compartments, blocked the cellular uptake of toxin B 
in Chinese hamster ovary cells cells. Extracellular acidification (pH </= 5.2) 
induced uptake of toxin B into the cytosol even in the presence of bafilomycin 
A1. Toxin B increased (86)Rb(+) release when preloaded Chinese hamster ovary 
cells were exposed to low pH (pH </= 5.6) for 5 min. Release of (86)Rb(+) 
depended on the concentration of toxin B and on the pH of the extracellular 
medium. An antibody directed against the holotoxin prevented channel formation, 
whereas an antibody against the N-terminal enzyme domain was without effect. The 
N-terminally truncated toxin B fragment consisting of amino acids 547-2366 
increased (86)Rb(+) efflux when cells were exposed to low pH. Toxin B also 
induced pH-dependent channel formation in artificial lipid bilayer membranes. 
Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, another member of the family of large 
clostridial cytotoxins, also induced increased (86)Rb(+) release at low pH. The 
results suggest that large clostridial cytotoxins including C. difficile toxin B 
and C. sordellii lethal toxin undergo structural changes at low pH of endosomes 
that are accompanied by membrane insertion and channel formation.
