Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), one of the virulence factors produced by the 
bacteria, exerts its toxicity by up-regulating various signaling cascades 
downstream of the heterotrimeric GTPases Gq and G12/13 in an unknown fashion. 
Here, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal region (residues 
575-1,285) of PMT, which carries an intracellularly active moiety. The overall 
structure of C-terminal region of PMT displays a Trojan horse-like shape, 
composed of three domains with a "feet"-,"body"-, and "head"-type arrangement, 
which were designated C1, C2, and C3 from the N to the C terminus, respectively. 
The C1 domain, showing marked similarity in steric structure to the N-terminal 
domain of Clostridium difficile toxin B, was found to lead the toxin molecule to 
the plasma membrane. The C3 domain possesses the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad 
that is organized only when the Cys is released from a disulfide bond. The 
steric alignment of the triad corresponded well to that of papain or other 
enzymes carrying Cys-His-Asp. PMT toxicities on target cells were completely 
abrogated when one of the amino acids constituting the triad was mutated. Our 
results indicate that PMT is an enzyme toxin carrying the cysteine protease-like 
catalytic triad dependent on the redox state and functions on the cytoplasmic 
face of the plasma membrane of target cells.
