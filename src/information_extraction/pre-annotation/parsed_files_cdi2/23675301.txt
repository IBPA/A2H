Clostridium difficile spores must germinate in vivo to become actively growing 
bacteria in order to produce the toxins that are necessary for disease. C. 
difficile spores germinate in vitro in response to certain bile acids and 
glycine. In other sporulating bacteria, proteins embedded within the inner 
membrane of the spore sense the presence of germinants and trigger the release 
of Ca⁺⁺-dipicolinic acid (Ca⁺⁺-DPA) from the spore core and subsequent 
hydrolysis of the spore cortex, a specialized peptidoglycan. Based upon homology 
searches of known germinant receptors from other spore-forming bacteria, C. 
difficile likely uses unique mechanisms to recognize germinants. Here, we 
identify the germination-specific protease, CspC, as the C. difficile bile acid 
germinant receptor and show that bile acid-mediated germination is important for 
establishing C. difficile disease in the hamster model of infection. These 
results highlight the importance of bile acids in triggering in vivo germination 
and provide the first description of a C. difficile spore germinant receptor. 
Blocking the interaction of bile acids with the C. difficile spore may represent 
an attractive target for novel therapeutics.
