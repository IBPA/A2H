Novel antibody constructs consisting of two or more different camelid 
heavy-chain only antibodies (VHHs) joined via peptide linkers have proven to 
have potent toxin-neutralizing activity in vivo against Shiga, botulinum, 
Clostridium difficile, anthrax, and ricin toxins. However, the mechanisms by 
which these so-called bispecific VHH heterodimers promote toxin neutralization 
remain poorly understood. In the current study we produced a new collection of 
ricin-specific VHH heterodimers, as well as VHH homodimers, and characterized 
them for their ability neutralize ricin in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate 
that the VHH heterodimers, but not homodimers were able to completely protect 
mice against ricin challenge, even though the two classes of antibodies 
(heterodimers and homodimers) had virtually identical affinities for ricin 
holotoxin and similar IC50 values in a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay. The VHH 
heterodimers did differ from the homodimers in their ability to promote toxin 
aggregation in solution, as revealed through analytical ultracentrifugation. 
Moreover, the VHH heterodimers that were most effective at promoting ricin 
aggregation in solution were also the most effective at blocking ricin 
attachment to cell surfaces. Collectively, these data suggest that heterodimeric 
VHH-based neutralizing agents may function through the formation of 
antibody-toxin complexes that are impaired in their ability to access host cell 
receptors.
