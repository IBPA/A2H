BACKGROUND: The fecal microbiota, fecal bile acid concentrations, and abundance 
of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are altered in acute and 
chronic gastrointestinal disease in adult dogs. However, less is known in young 
puppies.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine composition of the fecal microbiota, assess 
development of fecal bile acid profiles, and determine the abundance of 
Clostridial species in puppies, young adult dogs, and adult dogs.
ANIMALS: Healthy puppies from a whelping kennel (n = 53) and healthy 
client-owned dogs <1 year old (n = 20) were separated into 6 age groups, then 
compared to client-owned dogs over 1 year of age (n = 13).
METHODS: Prospective observational study. Naturally voided fecal samples were 
analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure bacterial 
abundances. Fecal bile acids were quantified using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: Puppies up to 5 to 6 weeks of age had increased Dysbiosis Index (median 
[min-max]: 5.39 [1.32-8.6], P < .001), increased abundance of C. difficile (4.1 
[0.01-4.85] log DNA, P < .001), decreased secondary bile acid concentrations 
(0.61 [0.28-5.06] μg/mg, P = .006), and decreased abundance of C. hiranonis 
(0.84 [0.01-6.71], P = .005) compared to adult dogs (-4.62 [-8.36 to -0.61], 
0.01 [0.01-0.01], 4.12 [0.32-8.94], and 6.02 [5.06-7.00], respectively). 
Secondary bile acid concentration positively correlated with C. hiranonis 
abundance (ρ = 0.77; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The increase in secondary bile acids and 
simultaneous decrease of C. difficile and C. perfringens after 5 to 6 weeks of 
age warrants further investigation into regulatory impacts that secondary bile 
acids could have on clostridial species in dogs.
