Clostridium (C.) difficile is a common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in horses. 
Vancomycin and metronidazole have been used as standard treatments but are only 
moderately effective, which highlights the need for a novel alternative therapy. 
In the current study, we prepared antiserum of equine origin against both C. 
difficile toxins A and B as well as whole-cell bacteria. The toxin-neutralizing 
activities of the antibodies were evaluated in vitro and the prophylactic 
effects of in vivo passive immunotherapy were demonstrated using a conventional 
mouse model. The data demonstrated that immunized horses generated antibodies 
against both toxins A and B that possessed toxin-neutralizing activity. 
Additionally, mice treated with the antiserum lost less weight without any sign 
of illness and regained weight back to a normal range more rapidly compared to 
the control group when challenged orally with 10(7) C. difficile spores 1 day 
after serum injection. These results indicate that intravenous delivery of 
hyperimmune serum can protect animals from C. difficile challenge in a 
dose-dependent manner. Hence, immunotherapy may be a promising prophylactic 
strategy for preventing C. difficile infection in horses.
