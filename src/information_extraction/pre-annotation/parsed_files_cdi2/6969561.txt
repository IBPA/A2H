Penicillin treatment resulted in lethal hemorrhagic cecitis in seven of eight 
guinea pigs. Cecal contents at necropsy from all seven animals contained a 
cytopathic toxin which was neutralized by Clostridium sordellii and C difficile 
antitoxins. Bacteriologic cultural examinations of these specimens yielded 
penicillin-sensitive strains of C difficile which produced a similar or 
identical cytotoxin in vitro. Stools obtained before penicillin administration 
and cecal contents from control animals lacked a cytotoxin and cultures failed 
to yield C difficile. Intracecal injection of cell-free supernatant of C 
difficile broth cultures reproduced the lesion noted with penicillin treatment. 
These results implicate C difficile as an agent of penicillin-induced lethal 
hemorrhagic cecitis in guinea pigs.
