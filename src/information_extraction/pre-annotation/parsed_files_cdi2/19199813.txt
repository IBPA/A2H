Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) belongs to the family of clostridial 
glucosylating toxins. TcsL exhibits glucosyltransferase activity to inactivate 
Rho and Ras proteins. On cultured cells, TcsL causes actin reorganization 
("cytopathic effect") and apoptotic cell death ("cytotoxic effect"). This study 
is based on the concept that the cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the 
glucosylation of critical substrate proteins rather than on the 
glucosyltransferase activity per se. The cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the 
glucosyltransferase activity of TcsL, as neither chemically inactivated TcsL nor 
a glucosyltransferase-deficient mutant version of TcsL caused it. The TcsL 
homologous toxin B from Clostridium difficile serotype F strain 1470 (TcdBF) 
also failed to cause cytotoxic effects. Correlation of the toxins' respective 
protein substrate specificities highlighted (H/K/N)Ras as critical substrate 
proteins for the cytotoxic effects. (H/K/N)Ras are critical upstream regulators 
of phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival signaling. 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) classified to activate PI3K/Akt signaling 
downstream of apoptosis-inducing stimuli prevented the cytotoxic effects of 
TcsL. In conclusion, (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation and subsequent inhibition of 
PI3K/Akt signaling are critical for the cytotoxic effects of TcsL.
