There are numerous concerns over the potential for transfer of pathogens between 
species during clinical xenotransplantation, and although current clinical 
application is limited, porcine xenografts have been previously used to treat 
patients with severe burns. Donor animals providing the xenografts are sourced 
from a healthy commercial herd, however, as pigs are a known source of zoonotic 
agents, a number of diseases are required to be excluded from pigs used for 
xenotransplantation purposes. Many studies have indicated the relevance of viral 
zoonoses, however, little has been done with regard to the potential for 
transfer of pathogens related to health care associated infections. Clostridium 
difficile is a major cause of neonatal enteritis in pigs and an important 
feature of this organism is that pigs can be asymptomatic carriers. This study 
has examined the incidence of C. difficile PCR ribotypes present in healthy 
donor pigs to determine if pig faeces, and in particular, contamination of skin 
with faecal matter, is a potential route for the transfer of C. difficile. 
Animals were found to have human ribotype 017 present in the faecal matter, 
however, no C. difficile was isolated from skin samples taken from the same 
animals. In addition, due to the risk factors associated with C. difficile 
infection, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the C. difficile isolates has 
been determined.
