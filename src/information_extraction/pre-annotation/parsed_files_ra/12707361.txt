We reported recently that albumin is a suitable drug carrier for targeted 
delivery of methotrexate (MTX) to tumors. Due to pathophysiological conditions 
in neoplastic tissue, high amounts of albumin accumulate in tumors and are 
metabolized by malignant cells. MTX, covalently coupled to human serum albumin 
(MTX-HSA) for cancer treatment, is currently being evaluated in phase II 
clinical trials. Because synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
shares various features observed also in tumors, albumin-based drug targeting of 
inflamed joints might be an attractive therapeutic approach. Therefore, the 
pharmacokinetics of albumin and MTX in a mouse model of arthritis was examined. 
Additionally, uptake of albumin by synovial fibroblasts of RA patients and the 
efficacy of MTX and MTX-HSA in arthritic mice were studied. The results show 
that when compared with MTX, significantly higher amounts of albumin accumulate 
in inflamed paws, and significantly lower amounts of albumin are found in the 
liver and the kidneys. The protein is metabolized by human synovial fibroblasts 
in vitro and in vivo. MTX-HSA was significantly more effective in suppression of 
the onset of arthritis in mice than was MTX. In conclusion, albumin appears to 
be a suitable drug carrier in RA, most likely due to effects on synovial 
fibroblasts, which might increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects 
of MTX.
