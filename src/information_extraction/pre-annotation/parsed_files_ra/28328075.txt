BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, chronic autoimmune disease 
characterized by various inflammatory symptoms, including joint swelling, joint 
pain, and both structural and functional joint damage. The most commonly used 
animal model for studying RA is mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA); the 
wide use of this model is due primarily to many similarities with RA in human 
patients. Metabolomics is used increasingly in biological studies for diagnosing 
disease and for predicting and evaluating drug interventions, as a large number 
of disease-associated metabolites can be analyzed and interpreted from a 
biological perspective.
AIM: To profile free amino acids and their biogenic metabolites in CIA mice 
plasma.
METHOD: Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
coupled with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for metabolomics study.
RESULTS: Profile of 45 amine metabolites, including free amino acids and their 
biogenic metabolites in plasma was obtained from CIA mice. We found that the 
plasma levels of 20 amine metabolites were significantly decreased in the CIA 
group.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a disordered amine response is linked to 
RA-associated muscle wasting and energy expenditure.
