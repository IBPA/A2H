Neutrophil recruitment into the joint is a hallmark of inflammatory arthritides, 
including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a mouse model of autoantibody-induced 
inflammatory arthritis, neutrophils infiltrate the joint via multiple 
chemoattractant receptors, including the leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) receptor BLT1 
and the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CXCR2. Once in the joint, neutrophils 
perpetuate their own recruitment by releasing LTB(4) and IL-1β, presumably after 
activation by immune complexes deposited on joint structures. Two pathways by 
which immune complexes may activate neutrophils include complement fixation, 
resulting in the generation of C5a, and direct engagement of Fcγ receptors 
(FcγRs). Previous investigations showed that this model of autoantibody-induced 
arthritis requires the C5a receptor C5aR and FcγRs, but the simultaneous 
necessity for both pathways was not understood. Here we show that C5aR and FcγRs 
work in sequence to initiate and sustain neutrophil recruitment in vivo. 
Specifically, C5aR activation of neutrophils is required for LTB(4) release and 
early neutrophil recruitment into the joint, whereas FcγR engagement upon 
neutrophils induces IL-1β release and subsequent neutrophil-active chemokine 
production, ensuring continued inflammation. These findings support the concept 
that immune complex-mediated leukocyte activation is not composed of overlapping 
and redundant pathways, but that each element serves a distinct and critical 
function in vivo, culminating in tissue inflammation.
