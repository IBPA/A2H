CML-1 is a purified extract from a mixture of 13 Oriental herbs (Achyranthis 
Radix, Angelicae Gigantis Radix, Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus, Eucommiae Cortex, 
Glycyrrhizae Radix, Hoelen, Lycii Fructus, Paeoniae Radix, Rehmanniae Radix 
Preparata and Atractylodis Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Zizyphi Semen, Acori 
Graminei Rhizoma) that have been widely used for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases in Asia. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory 
and analgesic potential of CML-1. The animals used in this study were 
administered either vehicle or CML-1 (30, 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg) orally. The 
vascular permeability induced by acetic acid was significantly reduced by CML-1 
in all doses. The swelling of the rat's hind paw induced by carrageenan was 
significantly inhibited by CML-1 in doses of 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg. In the case 
of rheumatoid arthritis induced by complete Freund's adjuvant in rats, the 
treatment with CML-1 at a dose level of 300 mg/kg inhibited edema. CML-1 at a 
dose level of 600 mg/kg inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing syndrome, however 
it did not have any anti-nociceptive action in the Randall-Selitto assay or the 
hot plate test. Our findings suggest that CML-1 has a potent anti-inflammatory 
activity.
