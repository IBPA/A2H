Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious medical problem, with approximately 1% of 
the people in the world affected. The disease is autoimmune in nature and 
characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue in multiple joints, 
which leads to joint destruction, although the etiopathogenesis has not been 
elucidated completely. It is remarkable that expression of inflammatory 
cytokines is augmented in the joints. We previously reported on an inflammatory 
arthropathy resembling RA that develops in high incidence among transgenic (Tg) 
mice that carry the human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) tax gene. 
Autoimmune pathogenesis was suggested in this RA model, and levels of cytokines 
including IL-1 were elevated in the joints of these Tg mice. Depletion of IL-1 
by gene targeting greatly reduced the incidence of the disease, indicating the 
importance of this cytokine in the development of arthritis. Furthermore, IL-1 
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)-deficient mice develop autoimmunity and arthritis 
spontaneously. These observations suggest that excess IL-1 signaling causes 
autoimmunity. We show that IL-1 activates the immune system non-specifically by 
inducing CD40L and OX40 co-signaling molecules on T cells. In this review, the 
roles of IL-1 in the development of autoimmunity and arthritis will be discussed 
in correlation with the development of new drugs.
