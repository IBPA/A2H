OBJECTIVE: CD8+ T cells are part of the T cell pool infiltrating the synovium in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their role in the pathogenesis of RA has not 
been fully delineated. Using the K/BxN mouse model of spontaneous chronic 
arthritis, which shares many similarities with RA, we studied the potential of 
CD8+ T cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to stop and reverse the 
progression of experimental arthritis.
METHODS: CD8+ T cells from the blood and articular infiltrate of K/BxN mice were 
characterized for cell surface phenotypic markers and for cytokine production. 
Additionally, mice were treated with specific anti-CD8 mAb (YTS105 and 
YTS169.4), with and without thymectomy.
RESULTS: CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood and joints of K/BxN mice were 
mainly CD69+ and CD62L-CD27+ T cells expressing proinflammatory cytokines 
(interferon-γ [IFNγ], tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], interleukin-17a [IL-17A], 
and IL-4), and granzyme B. In mice receiving anti-CD8 mAb, the arthritis score 
improved 5 days after treatment. Recovery of the CD8+ T cells was associated 
with a new increase in the arthritis score after 20 days. In thymectomized and 
anti-CD8 mAb-treated mice, the arthritis score improved permanently. Histologic 
analysis showed an absence of inflammatory infiltrate in the anti-CD8 
mAb-treated mice. In anti-CD8 mAb-treated mice, the serologic levels of TNFα, 
IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-5 normalized. The levels of the disease-related 
anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase antibodies did not change.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that synovial activated effector CD8+ T cells 
locally synthesize proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL-17, IL-6) and 
granzyme B in the arthritic joint, thus playing a pivotal role in maintaining 
chronic synovitis in the K/BxN mouse model of arthritis.
