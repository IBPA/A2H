BACKGROUND: We recently synthesized a hydrophilic polymer, 
poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-co-N-(3-azidopropyl)methacrylamide), 
p(HPMA-co-AzMA), by RAFT polymerization using a novel azide-containing 
methacrylamide monomer that through a post modification strategy using click 
chemistry enabled facile preparation of a panel of versatile and well-defined 
bioconjugates. In this work we screen a panel of different molecular weight (Mw) 
fluorescently tagged p(HPMA-co-AzMA) in healthy mice, by live bioimaging, to 
select an extended circulatory half-life material for investigating joint 
accumulation in a murine collagen antibody-induced arthritis model.
FINDINGS: Fluorescence image analysis revealed half-lifes of <20 min, 2.8 h and 
6.4 h for p(HPMA-co-AzMA) of 15, 36 and 54 kDa, respectively, with ~10% polymer 
retained in the blood after 24 h for the highest Mw. p(HPMA-co-AzMA) of 54 kDa 
showed enhanced accumulation in the joints of the arthritic mouse model with a 
bioavailability (AUC = 1783% · h) ~12 times higher (P = 0.01) than healthy 
control (AUC = 148% · h).
CONCLUSIONS: p(HPMA-co-AzMA) of 54 kDa exhibited extended circulatory half-life 
and preferential accumulation in inflamed joints of a murine model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). This combined with well-defined polymer size and versatility for 
conjugation of a range of biomolecules promotes p(HPMA-co-AzMA) for potential 
applications in the delivery of drugs for treatment of RA.
