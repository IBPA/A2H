Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is an 
important signaling enzyme downstream of immunoreceptors containing an 
intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine activating motif (ITAM). These receptors 
encompass a wide variety of biological functions involved in autoimmune disease 
pathogenesis. There has been considerable interest in the development of 
inhibitors of the Syk pathway for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. We report that Syk inhibition mechanistically 
caused peri-islet hemorrhages and fibrin deposition in the rat pancreas and that 
this finding is due to a homeostatic functional defect in platelets. In more 
limited studies, similar lesions could not be induced in mice, dogs, and 
cynomolgus monkeys at similar or higher plasma drug concentrations. 
Irradiation-induced thrombocytopenia caused a phenotypically similar peri-islet 
pancreas lesion and the formation of this lesion could be prevented by platelet 
transfusion. In addition, Syk inhibitor-induced lesions were prevented by the 
coadministration of prednisone. A relatively greater sensitivity of rat 
platelets to Syk inhibition was supported by functional analyses demonstrating 
rat-specific differences in response to convulxin, a glycoprotein VI agonist 
that signals through Syk. These data demonstrate that the Syk pathway is 
critical in platelet-endothelial cell homeostasis in the peri-islet pancreatic 
microvasculature in rats.
