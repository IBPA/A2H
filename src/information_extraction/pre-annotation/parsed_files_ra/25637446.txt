Methyl salicylate 2-O-β-D-lactoside (MSL) is a derivative of natural salicylate 
isolated from Gaultheria yunnanensis (Franch.) Rehder, which is widely used for 
treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), swelling and pain. The aim of the present 
study was to investigate the effect of MSL on the progression of 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rat in vivo and explore the 
anti-inflammatory effects and mechanism of MSL in lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-treated murine macrophages RAW264.7 cells in vitro. Our results showed 
that MSL significantly inhibited the arthritis progression in AIA rats, 
decreasing the right hind paw swelling and ankle diameter, attenuating 
histopathological changes and suppressing the plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-1β 
in AIA rats. Besides, MSL had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the 
LPS-activated RAW264.7. MSL dose-dependently inhibited the activity of COX-1, 
and COX-2. Moreover, MSL prominently inhibited LPS-induced activation of MAPK in 
RAW264.7 cells by blocking phosphorylation of p38 and ERK. Our study suggests 
that MSL may be effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases by 
inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine production and regulating the MAPK 
signal pathway.
