Adjuvant arthritis (AA) serves as an excellent model for human rheumatoid 
arthritis. AA is readily inducible in certain rat strains, but not in others. 
Susceptibility/resistance to AA is determined by multiple factors. Among the 
genetic factors, both MHC and non-MHC genes contribute to arthritis 
susceptibility, and specific quantitative trait loci show association with the 
severity of the disease. Differential T-cell proliferative and cytokine 
responses, as well as antibody responses, to heat-shock proteins are evident 
when comparing AA-susceptible and AA-resistant rats. In addition, neuroendocrine 
factors and the housing environment can further modulate arthritis 
susceptibility/severity in particular rat strains.
