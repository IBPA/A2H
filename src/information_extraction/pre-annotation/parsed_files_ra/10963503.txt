Biologic agents that target molecules and cells involved in chronic inflammation 
are coming into clinical use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). New 
agents block the action of cytokines, which play a key role in the pathogenesis 
of RA. Among the many cytokines involved in RA, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is 
believed to be dominant. Two agents for neutralizing TNF are now available. One 
is a recombinant molecule, etanercept, which is derived from a naturally 
occurring TNF antagonist, one of the soluble human TNF receptors. The other, 
infliximab, is a chimeric (human-mouse) monoclonal antibody against human TNF. 
These biologic agents have been shown to relieve symptoms in patients with 
refractory RA. If tolerance of these and other anticipated anticytokine agents 
continues over the long term, treatment for patients with RA will become safer 
and more effective.
