In an effort to identify CYP and hERG clean mPGES-1 inhibitors from the 
dihydrofuran-fused tricyclic benzo[d]imidazole series lead 7, an extensive 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were performed. Optimization of A, 
D and E-rings in 7 afforded many potent compounds with human whole blood potency 
in the range of 160-950 nM. Selected inhibitors 21d, 21j, 21m, 21n, 21p and 22b 
provided selectivity against COX-enzymes and mPGES-1 isoforms (mPGES-2 and 
cPGES) along with sufficient selectivity against prostanoid synthases. Most of 
the tested analogs demonstrated required metabolic stability in liver 
microsomes, low hERG and CYP liability. Oral pharmacokinetics and 
bioavailability of lead compounds 21j, 21m and 21p are discussed in multiple 
species like rat, guinea pig, dog, and cynomolgus monkey. Besides, these 
compounds revealed low to moderate activity against human pregnane X receptor 
(hPXR). The selected lead 21j further demonstrated in vivo efficacy in acute 
hyperalgesia (ED50: 39.6 mg/kg) and MIA-induced osteoarthritic pain models 
(ED50: 106 mg/kg).
