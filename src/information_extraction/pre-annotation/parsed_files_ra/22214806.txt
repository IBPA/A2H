Prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients has significantly improved with 
the recent use of biologics targeting TNFÎ±, IL-6, and co-stimulatory molecule. 
In US and Europe, clear therapeutic benefit of anti-CD20 antibodies is also 
confirmed. As a disease specific marker, rheumatoid factor and 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody are crucial in RA, although the pathology of 
them is not defined. Here we focus on glycolytic enzyme such as 
glucose-6-phospate isomerase, that is confirmed as arthritogenic in two 
different mouse models, and discuss about pathogenic relevance to RA.
