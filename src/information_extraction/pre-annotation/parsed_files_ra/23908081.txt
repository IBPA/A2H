OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of Chuju total flavonoids (CJTF) on the 
secreted frizzledrelated protein 4 (SFRP4) expression in Wnt pathway in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model rats.
METHODS: The role of CJTF in the treatment of RA model rats was evaluated by rat 
arthritis score and paw edema score. The expression regulation of the SFRP4, 
β-catenin and C-myc in Wnt pathway in RA model rats was detected by RT-PCR and 
Western blot after CJTF gavage treatment.
RESULTS: After CJTF treatment, the rat arthritis score and paw edema score in RA 
model rats were significantly decreased when the RA model rats were treated with 
CJTF, the SFRP4 expression was significantly up-regulated, while the β-catenin 
and C-myc gene expression were significantly downregulated in RA model rat 
synovial tissues.
CONCLUSION: CJTF has significant therapeutic effect and inhibitory effect on Wnt 
pathway activation by targeting SFRP4 in RA model rat synovium.
