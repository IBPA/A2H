Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) of a living system received scientific 
attention because of its potential for monitoring increased levels of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this 
study, a highly sensitive cryogenic charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was used 
to monitor in a RA mouse model the photon emission both without and with 
luminol. For that purpose, arthritis was induced in mice utilizing a repeated 
co-administration of type II collagen with lipopolysaccharide. Quantitative 
imaging of ultra-weak photon emission of the front and back paws of the animals 
was initiated 70 days after the first injection. All of the animals were 
measured once without luminol and once again immediately after luminol 
injection. Data illustrated a higher UPE intensity after initiating arthritis by 
CII-injection of the animals. The increase in UPE intensity was measured with 
and without using luminol indicating that this imaging technology may be useful 
for the future study of human RA.
