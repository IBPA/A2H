Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disorder which involves the activation of 
immune system against the self-tissues. The main targets of this disease are the 
joints. Being systemic the development of this disease involves different 
mechanisms and thus the exact cause of this disease remains unknown. Although 
different drugs have been developed, none has been found to be the cure for this 
disease. In the current study the rat carrageenin paw was used as a model for 
acute inflammation and mycobacterium induced adjuvant arthritic model was used 
for exploring the antiarthritic potential of methanolic extract of Gentiana 
kurroo. In this study the different extracts tested showed less inhibition of 
acute inflammation than methanolic extract. The methanolic extract was further 
used in different doses and the anti-inflammatory efficacy was found to be dose 
dependent. The results obtained were significant with the control and the 
standard groups. In the arthritic model the methanolic extract showed decrease 
in the paw volume of arthritic animals and also in the arthritic symptoms. Again 
the results obtained were found to be significantly dose dependent. From the 
results obtained it can be concluded that this extract may serve as a source of 
drug against the rheumatoid arthritis.
