Leukocyte recruitment of sites of inflammation and tissue injury involves 
leukocyte rolling along the endothelial wall, followed by firm adherence of the 
leukocyte, and finally transmigration of the leukocyte across cell junctions 
into the underlying tissue. The initial rolling step is mediated by the 
interaction of leukocyte glycoproteins containing active moieties such as sialyl 
Lewisx (sLex) with P-selectin expressed on endothelial cells. Consequently, 
inhibition of this interaction by means of a small molecule P-selectin 
antagonist is an attractive strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
such as arthritis. High-throughput screening of the Wyeth chemical library 
identified the quinoline salicylic acid class of compounds (1) as antagonists of 
P-selectin, with potency in in vitro and cell-based assays far superior to that 
of sLex. Through iterative medicinal chemistry, we identified analogues with 
improved P-selectin activity, decreased inhibition of dihydrooratate 
dehydrogenase, and acceptable CYP profiles. Lead compound 36 was efficacious in 
the rat AIA model of rheumatoid arthritis.
