Rituximab, a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody directed to the CD20 
antigen expressed on pre-B lymphocytes and mature lymphocytes, causes a profound 
B-cell depletion. Due to its peculiar characteristics, this drug has been used 
to treat oncohaematological diseases, B cell-related autoimmune diseases, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and, more recently, HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinaemic 
vasculitis. Rituximab-based treatment, however, may induce an increased 
replication of several viruses such as hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, 
varicella-zoster virus, echovirus, and parvovirus B19. Recent data suggest that 
rituximab-based chemotherapy induces an increase in HCV expression in hepatic 
cells, which may become a target for a cell-mediated immune reaction after the 
withdrawal of treatment and the restoration of the immune control. Only a few 
small studies have investigated the occurrence of HCV reactivation and an 
associated hepatic flare in patients with oncohaematological diseases receiving 
R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). 
These studies suggest that the hepatic flares are frequently asymptomatic, but 
life-threatening liver failure occurs in nearly 10% of cases.
