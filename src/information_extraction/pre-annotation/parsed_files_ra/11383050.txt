INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antineoplastic agent widely used in low 
dose to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its side effects can 
partly be explained by folate antagonism. Folinic acid (Leucovorin) is generally 
administered with MTX to decrease MTX-induced toxicity. However information 
regarding the inhibitory effect of folinic acid against cytogenetic damage 
caused by MTX is limited. The aim of this study was to assess the protective 
effect of folinic acid against MTX-genotoxicity.
METHODS: This study was done on Wistar albino rats and in patients with RA. 
Forty rats of both sexes were randomized into four equal groups and dosed in the 
following way: Group-I, distilled water vehicle; Group-II, 0.5 mg/kg folinic 
acid; Group-III, 0.5 mg/kg MTX; Group-IV, 0.5 mg/kg folinic acid plus 0.5 mg/kg 
MTX. Doses were given i.p., once daily for 8 consecutive days. A bone marrow 
chromosomal study and a micronucleus test were performed for each rat. Twenty 
patients with RA (5 males and 15 females) on a 10 mg weekly dose of MTX, i.m., 
for one month, were administered the same dose of MTX in addition to 10 mg of 
folinic acid as a single dose 4 hours after MTX administration, i.m., every week 
for another 4 weeks. Chromosomal studies as well as a micronucleus test were 
evaluated for each patient.
RESULTS: MTX produced a significant genetic injury as proved by the increased 
incidence of chromosomal aberration and micronuclei formation in Group-III 
animals. Inversely, folinic acid (group IV) produced a significant protection 
against genetic damages induced by MTX. In RA patients, folinic acid provides 
satisfactory improvement of MTX-induced genetic damage.
CONCLUSION: Folinic acid has a protective affect against MTX genotoxicity in 
human as well as in animal models.
