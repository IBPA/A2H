Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an experimental arthritis model used to 
study the inflammatory processes in this disease and test potential 
therapeutics. In order to better characterize this model, we conducted the first 
comprehensive gene expression analysis of rat CIA. To evaluate how closely the 
rat model reflects human rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we also analysed gene 
expression in human RA, using genome-wide Affymetrix gene arrays. By applying 
multiple strategies, including comparison of the highest induced genes, 
expression of immunological-associated genes as well as Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA), we were able to compare the two expression profiles. Among the 
highest induced genes in RA were several B-cell-associated genes, including 
immunoglobulins, B-cell markers such as CD20, and cytokines and chemokines that 
act on B cells such as TNFSF13b/BLyS and CXCL13, none of which was upregulated 
in CIA. The latter was instead characterized by the upregulation of genes 
expressed primarily in macrophages and dendritic cells. Of the 22 pathways 
identified as significant in both diseases by IPA, only three (IL6, chemokine 
signalling and antigen presentation) were present in both settings. We conclude 
that there are significant differences in the inflammatory mechanisms between 
human RA and rat CIA, and that genome-wide comparative gene expression analyses 
are useful tools to evaluate the relevance of animal models to human disease.
