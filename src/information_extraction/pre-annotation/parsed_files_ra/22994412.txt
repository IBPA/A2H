CONTEXT: Clematichinenoside (AR-6) is a triterpene saponin from an 
anti-arthritic herbal formula Wei-Ling-Xian in Chinese, which is an herbal 
medicine derived from the dried root and rhizome of Clematis chinensis Osbeck, 
C. hexapetala Pall., or C. manshurica Rupr. (Ranunculaceae).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the modulating effect and explored the potential 
mechanism of AR-6 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) in a rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CIA was evaluated by measuring body weight, paw swelling 
and organ index. Expression of TNF-α, PI3K and p-Akt in synovium tissue was 
measured by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, expression of TNF-α mRNA, PI3K 
mRNA and p-Akt mRNA was measured with RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The intragastric administration of AR-6 (32, 16 and 8 mg/kg), 
especially the high dose level of 32 mg/kg, significantly suppressed the 
swelling of hind paws of CIA rats (p < 0.01) and inhibited their body weight 
loss (p < 0.01). Based on histopathological observation, all AR-6 groups showed 
great amelioration compared with model group. Moreover, AR-6 significantly 
reduced the production of TNF-α, PI3K and p-Akt expression by 
immunohistochemistry (p < 0.01), and decreased TNF-α mRNA, PI3K mRNA and p-Akt 
mRNA in CIA rat synovium (p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Our study indicates the mechanism of AR-6 is associated with 
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and TNF-α.
CONCLUSIONS: Such characteristics relating to AR-6 curing chronic inflammation 
of CIA, may be effectively applied to the therapeutic potential in patients with 
inactive RA.
