Autoimmune diseases are a significant area of unmet medical need in the Western 
World, but human antibodies are an emerging drug class that could address this 
demand. Some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are currently 
benefiting from antibody treatment and new and existing technologies for 
antibody generation could facilitate the production of effective human 
antibodies as future drug candidates for other autoimmune diseases. Several 
methods of generating human antibodies for use as therapeutics have been 
established, the most commonly used being phage display and transgenic mouse 
technologies and more recently, cell-free display technologies have also 
emerged. In this review, we explain the principles behind the various methods of 
antibody generation and highlight some potential benefits of certain approaches 
in the context of treatment of autoimmune disease.
