Daphnetin (DAP), a coumarin derivative, has been reported to have multiple 
pharmacological actions including analgesia, antimalarial, anti-arthritic, and 
anti-pyretic properties. It is unclear whether DAP has neuroprotective effects 
on ischemic brain injury. In this study, we found that DAP treatment (i.c.v.) 
reduced the infarct volume at 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion injury and 
improved neurological behaviors in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse 
model. Moreover, we provided evidences that DAP had protective effects on 
infarct volume in neonate rats even it was administrated at 4 h after cerebral 
hypoxia/ischemia injury. To explore its neuroprotective mechanisms of DAP, we 
examined the protection of DAP on glutamate toxicity-induced cell death in 
hippocampal HT-22 cells. Our results demonstrated that DAP protected against 
glutamate toxicity in HT-22 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, 
we found that DAP maintained the cellular levels of glutathione and superoxide 
dismutase activity, suggesting the anti-oxidatant activity of DAP. Since DAP has 
been used for the treatment of coagulation disorder and rheumatoid arthritis for 
long time with a safety profile, DAP will be a promising agent for the treatment 
of stroke.
