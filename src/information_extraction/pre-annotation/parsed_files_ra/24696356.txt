The use of live, attenuated, or genetically modified microbes or their cellular 
component(s) or metabolites has begun to emerge as a potential new approach in 
medicinal research to deliver biologically active entities. Thus, advancing our 
knowledge of such microbe-mediated therapy may suggest new avenues for 
therapeutic intervention in many diseases. We had earlier reported that the 
total lipid of attenuated Leishmania donovani suppressed the inflammatory 
responses in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Our present study reveals that the 
pLLD, isolated from pathogenic L. donovani, decreases the inflammatory level of 
bacterial endotoxin in stimulated mouse macrophages, as also in the in vivo 
murine system. It exerts the activity by reducing the level of different 
mediators, such as cytokine-chemokine(s). It also suppresses the expression of 
the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-ÎºBp65 in stimulated macrophage cells, 
improves the endotoxin-associated liver damage, reduces the vascular 
permeability factors, such as VEGF, and suppresses the expression of cell 
adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, PECAM-1, P-selectin, and 
E-selectin, in liver of septic mice. These findings indicate that pLLD may prove 
to be a potential anti-inflammatory agent and protect from endotoxin-induced 
sepsis in hepatic impairment.
