BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex disease characterized by 
autoimmune inflammation and joint destruction. Despite recent advances in RA 
treatment, current therapies require further improvement to overcome adverse 
events and ineffectiveness in some cases. By targeting different 
pathways/molecules using drug combinations, a better treatment can be obtained, 
whereas adverse events are reduced. In order to develop a new treatment option, 
the present study employs a gene therapy-based combination therapy using 
doxycycline and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT).
METHODS: DBA/1 mice were immunized with type II collagen to induce arthritis. 
Four weeks before immunization, they received a doxycycline containing diet and 
a single injection of adeno-associated virus vector expressing hAAT under the 
control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter. Control groups received 
doxycycline alone or saline. Macroscopic arthritis development as well as 
histopathological changes in the joint were evaluated. In addition, the effects 
of hAAT and doxycycline on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha-induced interleukin (IL)-6 production from mouse fibroblast cells 
were also determined.
RESULTS: Combination therapy significantly reduced arthritis development and 
progression compared to the control group in respect to macroscopic as well as 
histopathological changes. Doxycycline and hAAT in combination also inhibited 
IL-6 expression from LPS-stimulated NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, indicating a 
contributing mechanism of arthritis inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study indicate that a 
combination therapy using AAT and doxycycline holds promising potential as a new 
therapy for RA.
