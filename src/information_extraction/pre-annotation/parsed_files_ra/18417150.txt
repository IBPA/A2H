Drugs that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) are particularly important 
in the treatment of severe inflammatory progression in rheumatoid arthritis, 
Crohn's disease and psoriasis. Despite the central role of the TNF/TNF receptor 
(TNFR) in various disease states, there is a paucity of information concerning 
TNFR2 signaling. In this study, we have developed a simple and highly sensitive 
cell-death based assay system for analyzing TNFR2-mediated bioactivity that can 
be used to screen for TNFR2-selective drugs. Using a lentiviral vector, a 
chimeric receptor was engineered from the extracellular and transmembrane domain 
of human TNFR2 and the intracellular domain of mouse Fas and the recombinant 
protein was then expressed in TNFR1(-/-)R2(-/-) mouse preadipocytes. Our results 
demonstrate that this chimeric receptor is capable of inducing apoptosis by 
transmembrane- as well as soluble-TNF stimuli. Moreover, we found that our 
bioassay based on cell death phenotype had an approximately 80-fold higher 
sensitivity over existing bioassays. We believe our assay system will be an 
invaluable research tool for studying TNFR2 and for screening TNFR2-targeted 
drugs.
