Antibodies to citrullinated proteins and rheumatoid factor (RF) are widely used 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the antibodies to citrullinated 
proteins appear to be the most specific markers of the disease. The objective 
was to compare the diagnostic performance of the anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide 2 (anti-CCP2) and citrullinated protein Antibodies (CPA) with RF in the 
diagnosis of RA. Serum samples of 139 patients with RA and 131 patients with 
other rheumatic diseases were checked for anti-CCP2, CPA uses citrullinated 
recombinant rat filaggrin as the antigen assay, and RF. The specificity, 
sensitivity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of tests were then 
compared. The sensitivity of anti-CCP2, CPA, and RF were 82.7, 83.5, and 61.5%, 
respectively. The specificities of the tests were 91.2, 78.6, and 90.5%, 
respectively. The area under ROC curves for the tests were 0.925, 0.890, and 
0.847, respectively. Exclusion of overlaps was associated with improved 
specificity for CPA but no change in the specificity of RF and anti-CCP. The 
sensitivity of anti-CCP2, CPA, and RF were 66.7, 77.8, and 51.9% for patients 
with early RA, respectively. The findings of the present study indicate that 
anti-CCP2 might be of a better diagnostic value for the diagnosis of RA. They 
also showed that CPA and in the second place anti-CCP2 were useful in the 
diagnosis of early RA.
