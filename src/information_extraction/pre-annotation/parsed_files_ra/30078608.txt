Due to the complex biological pathways involved in rheumatoid arthritis, 
discovery of multi-targeting small molecules provides an effective strategy to 
achieve better efficacy and lower toxicity. Herein the first Syk/PDGFR-α/c-Kit 
inhibitors were designed and evaluated. Dihydrofuropyrimidine derivative 13 
showed potent inhibitory activity against the three targets. Importantly, 
compound 13 exhibited good cellular efficacy against fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (IC50 = 3.21 μM) and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells 
(IC50 = 2.03 μM) and significantly decreased the secretion of inflammatory 
cytokines. Thus, Syk/PDGFR-α/c-Kit triple inhibitor 13 represented a promising 
lead compound for the treatment of RA.
