iRHOM2, encoded by the gene Rhbdf2, regulates the maturation of the TNF-α 
convertase (TACE), which controls shedding of TNF-α and its biological activity 
in vivo. TACE is a potential target to treat TNF-α-dependent diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, but there are concerns about potential side effects, 
because TACE also protects the skin and intestinal barrier by activating EGFR 
signaling. Here we report that inactivation of Rhbdf2 allows tissue-specific 
regulation of TACE by selectively preventing its maturation in immune cells, 
without affecting its homeostatic functions in other tissues. The related 
iRHOM1, which is widely expressed, except in hematopoietic cells, supported TACE 
maturation and shedding of the EGFR ligand TGF-α in Rhbdf2-deficient cells. 
Remarkably, mice lacking Rhbdf2 were protected from K/BxN inflammatory arthritis 
to the same extent as mice lacking TACE in myeloid cells or Tnfa-deficient mice. 
In probing the underlying mechanism, we found that two main drivers of K/BxN 
arthritis, complement C5a and immune complexes, stimulated iRHOM2/TACE-dependent 
shedding of TNF-α in mouse and human cells. These data demonstrate that iRHOM2 
and myeloid-expressed TACE play a critical role in inflammatory arthritis and 
indicate that iRHOM2 is a potential therapeutic target for selective 
inactivation of TACE in myeloid cells.
