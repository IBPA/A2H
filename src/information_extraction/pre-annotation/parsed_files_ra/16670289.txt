Macrophages are known to play a key role during inflammation in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Inflammatory macrophages have increased expression of CD64, the 
high-affinity receptor for IgG. Targeting this receptor through a CD64-directed 
immunotoxin, composed of an Ab against CD64 and Ricin A, results in effective 
killing of inflammatory macrophages. In this study, we show elevated levels of 
CD64 on synovial macrophages in both synovial lining and synovial fluid in RA 
patients. The CD64-directed immunotoxin efficiently eliminates activated 
synovial macrophages in vitro, while leaving quiescent, low CD64-expressing 
macrophages unaffected. To examine whether killing of CD64 macrophages results 
in therapeutic effects in vivo, we established an adjuvant arthritis (AA) model 
in newly generated human CD64 (hCD64) transgenic rats. We demonstrate that hCD64 
regulation in this transgenic rat model is similar as in humans. After AA 
induction, treatment with CD64-directed immunotoxin results in significant 
inhibition of disease activity. There is a direct correlation between 
immunotoxin treatment and decreased macrophage numbers, followed by diminished 
inflammation and bone erosion in paws of these hCD64 transgenic rats. These data 
support synovial macrophages to play a crucial role in joint inflammation in AA 
in rats and in human RA. Selective elimination of inflammatory macrophages 
through a CD64-directed immunotoxin may provide a novel approach for treatment 
of RA.
