Total paeony glucosides (TPG) extracted from the roots of Radix Paeoniae Rubrae, 
have been approved for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis by the State Food and 
Drug Administration. We previously demonstrated the myocardial protective 
effects of TPG in both isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia rat and acute 
myocardial infarction rat. However, the underlying mechanism of TPG effect in 
cardiomyocytes remains to be investigated. The aims of this study were to 
elucidate the effect of TPG on the activities of antioxidant defense targets and 
the bioenergetic system in rat cardiomyocytes. The changes of viability, 
antioxidant defense system activities, protein contents, and mitochondrial 
functions in tert-butyl hydroperoxide challenged H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were 
evaluated. The results suggest that TPG ameliorated cardiomyoblast dysfunction 
by preserving antioxidant defense and bioenergetic system.
