Rheumatoid arthritis is a common chronic inflammatory disorder and a major cause 
of disability. Despite the progress made with recent clinical use of 
anti-cytokine biologics, the response rate of rheumatoid arthritis treatment 
remains unsatisfactory, owing largely to the complexity of cytokine interactions 
and the multiplicity of cytokine targets. Here, we show a nanoparticle-based 
broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory strategy for rheumatoid arthritis management. 
By fusing neutrophil membrane onto polymeric cores, we prepare neutrophil 
membrane-coated nanoparticles that inherit the antigenic exterior and associated 
membrane functions of the source cells, which makes them ideal decoys of 
neutrophil-targeted biological molecules. It is shown that these nanoparticles 
can neutralize proinflammatory cytokines, suppress synovial inflammation, target 
deep into the cartilage matrix, and provide strong chondroprotection against 
joint damage. In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis and a human 
transgenic mouse model of arthritis, the neutrophil membrane-coated 
nanoparticles show significant therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating joint damage 
and suppressing overall arthritis severity.
