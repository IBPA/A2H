Baseline sympathetic activity was found to be elevated in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) patients and it is related to increased cardiovascular risk in these 
patients. Although many studies have highlighted the association between RA and 
increased cardiac sympathetic activity, the underlying mechanistic links remain 
unclear. The aim of the present study was to understand how diseases-triggered 
changes in gene expression may result in maladaptive physiological changes. Our 
results suggest that the equilibrium between noradrenaline synthesis, release 
and reuptake was disrupted in the ventricles of arthritic rats. In the acute 
phase of the arthritic process, decreased gene expression of MAO-A might lead to 
accumulation of noradrenaline in myocardial interstitial space, whereas 
increased gene expression of NET protected cardiomyocytes from the deleterious 
effects of enhanced noradrenaline. During the chronic phase, reduced expression 
of Î²1-adrenoceptor and decreased efficiency of noradrenaline reuptake contribute 
to progressive damage of the myocardium and limits heart efficiency.
