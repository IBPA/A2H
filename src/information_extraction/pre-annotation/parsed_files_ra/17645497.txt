Auranofin (AF) is a sulphur-containing gold compound. Because of its 
anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, AF has been widely used for 
the therapeutic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, little is known 
about its mechanism of action. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying 
the anti-inflammatory effect of AF, we studied the effects of AF on cellular 
responses to interleukin-6 (IL-6). In HepG2 human hepatoma cells, AF markedly 
inhibited IL-6-induced phosphorylation of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT3 translocation into 
the nucleus. Consistent with this, AF diminished IL-6-induced production of the 
acute-phase proteins, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, C3 complement and alpha(1)-acid 
glycoprotein, and gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, all of 
whose transcriptional activities are regulated by STAT3. The inhibitory activity 
of AF on STAT3 phosphorylation was also demonstrated in primary cells, i.e. 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients, human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells and rat astrocytes. Auranofin-mediated inhibition of 
STAT3 phosphorylation was recovered by pretreatment with antioxidants containing 
thiol groups. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory action of AF is 
associated with a blockade of JAK1/STAT3 signalling. Thiol-group-reactive 
proteins may be involved in AF-induced suppression of JAK1/STAT3 
phosphorylation.
