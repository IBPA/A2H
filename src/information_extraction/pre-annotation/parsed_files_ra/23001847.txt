Migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are critical in 
the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hypoxic conditions are present in 
RA joints, and hypoxia has been extensively studied in angiogenesis and 
inflammation. However, its effect on the migration and invasion of RA-FLSs 
remains unknown. In this study, we observed that RA-FLSs exposed to hypoxic 
conditions experienced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with increased 
cell migration and invasion. We demonstrated that hypoxia-induced EMT was 
accompanied by increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression and 
activation of Akt. After knockdown or inhibition of HIF-1α in hypoxia by small 
interfering RNA or genistein (Gen) treatment, the EMT transformation and 
invasion ability of FLSs were regained. HIF-1α could be blocked by 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, indicating that HIF-1α 
activation was regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Administration of LY294002 (20 
mg/kg, intra-peritoneally) twice weekly and Gen (25 mg/kg, by gavage) daily for 
3 weeks from day 20 after primary immunization in a collagen-induced arthritis 
rat model, markedly alleviated the clinical signs, radiology progression, 
synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cells infiltration of joints. Thus, 
results of this study suggest that activation of the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α pathway 
plays a pivotal role in mediating hypoxia-induced EMT transformation and 
invasion of RA-FLSs under hypoxia.
