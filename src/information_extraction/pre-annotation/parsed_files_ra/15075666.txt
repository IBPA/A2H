SR31747A is currently being evaluated in phase IIb clinical trials for prostate 
cancer treatment. The molecule is a peripheral sigma ligand that binds four 
proteins in human cells, i.e. SRBP-1, sigma-2, HSI and its relative SRBP-2. 
SR31747A is a dual agent with both immunomodulatory and antiproliferative 
activities. The molecule blocks proliferation of human and mouse lymphocytes, 
modulates the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and was shown 
to protect animals in vivo against acute and chronic inflammatory conditions 
such as acute graft-versus-host reaction, lethality induced by staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B and lipopolysaccharide or rheumatoid arthritis. Besides these 
immunomodulatory activities, the molecule also inhibits the proliferation of 
various tumor cell lines in vitro in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. 
In vivo, SR31747A has potent antitumoral activity as demonstrated against 
mammary and prostatic tumoral cell lines injected into nude mice, where both 
tumor incidence and growth were decreased by more than 40% following daily 
SR31747A treatment at 25 mg/kg i.p. The recent literature on SR31747A in cancer 
is reviewed here. We focus specifically on preclinical data obtained in vivo and 
on studies aimed at deciphering the mode of action of the molecule.
