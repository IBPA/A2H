Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The agents, interfering specifically with the 
cytokine, have been produced to ameliorate disease activity of RA. There are 
only two reagents available in the Japanese market. Infliximab, a chimeric 
(mouse/human) IgG 1 monoclonal antibody to TNF-alpha, shows better efficacy in 
the combination with methotrexate (MTX) which reduces antichimeric molecule 
antibody responses in the RA therapy. Etanercept is a soluble form of human TNF 
type II receptor linked to an IgG 1-Fc moietry. Both TNF-alpha antagonists 
demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy and the addition of MTX at the early 
phase from the onset protected bone destruction. Infections are most frequent in 
their adverse effects.
