Alterations of the phospholipid (PL) compositions of body fluids are assumed to 
be indicative of inflammatory diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Recently, we have shown that particularly the 
phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine (PC/LPC) ratio determined in human 
synovial fluids (SF) and sera represents a reliable measure of the inflammatory 
state in RA patients. However, it is not yet clear to what extent the PC/LPC 
ratio is also affected by nutrition habits. In the present study, the PL and the 
corresponding acyl chain compositions of human body fluids (SF and serum of RA 
patients as well as serum from healthy volunteers) are compared with those of 
two other mammalian species (horses and dogs suffering from degenerative joint 
diseases as well as healthy controls) by high-resolution 31P-nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The most important result of 
this study is that the PL compositions of SF and serum of horse and dog are 
comparable with those of human body fluids. Compared with humans, however, the 
horse body fluid contains less PCs with highly unsaturated arachidonoyl 
residues, while that of dogs possesses the highest content of 
arachidonoyl-containing PC. These species-related differences stem primarily 
from different nutrition habits (meat vs. plants).
