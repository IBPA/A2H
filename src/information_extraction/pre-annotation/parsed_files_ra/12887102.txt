Autoantibodies directed against variable domain epitopes of the alpha/beta T 
cell receptor (TCR) occur in sera of man, mouse and other vertebrates. Here, we 
focus upon autoantibodies expressed in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
systemic erythematosus (SLE) with parallel studies involving collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA) in mice transgenic for human HLA-DR conferring resistance or 
susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We report specificity characterization of 
polyclonal and monoclonal IgM and IgG autoantibodies from SLE and for IgM 
monoclonal autoantibodies of RA patients. The data suggests that autoantibodies 
directed against "public" idiotopes present in the first complementarity 
determining region (CDR1) and the third framework (FR3) of the Vbeta gene 
products are generated in response to over-production of autodestructive T cells 
bearing particular Vbeta gene products and function to modulate (downregulate) 
the expression of these T cells. Since antibodies of these specificities are 
present in polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations used for 
therapeutic purposes, the immunomodulatory effects of antibodies directed 
against TCR variable domains may account, at least in part, for the efficacy of 
IVIG preparations in therapy of autoimmune diseases and in the prevention of 
graft versus host reactions.
