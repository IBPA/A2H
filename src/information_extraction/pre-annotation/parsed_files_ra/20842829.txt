Rituximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody, which binds to the CD20 
antigen on B lymphocytes and causes depletion of CD20+ cells in the mechanism of 
complement-dependent and independent cytolysis, cell cytotoxicity and 
antibody-dependent mechanism and apoptosis. Rituximab is currently registered 
for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 
rheumatoid arthritis. Rituximab also demonstrated efficacy in a number of other 
autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. In patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus rituximab decreases the number of autoreactive 
VH4.34 B cells, what contributes to sustaining B cell homeostasis and immune 
tolerance. A decrease in levels of circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies and an 
increase of C3 concentration is observed parallel to clinical improvement. 
Diagnostic procedures performed before initiation of rituximab therapy and 
during treatment include basic laboratory tests as well as exclusion of heart 
insufficiency and infections.
