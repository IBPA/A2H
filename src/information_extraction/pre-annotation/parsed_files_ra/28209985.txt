Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced angiogenesis plays important roles in 
the progression of various diseases, including cancer, wet age-related macular 
degeneration, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the relevance and role of 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in angiogenesis have not yet been 
clearly elucidated. In this study, VCAM-1 knockdown shows VCAM-1 involvement in 
TNFα-induced angiogenesis. Through competitive blocking experiments with VCAM-1 
Ig-like domain 6 (VCAM-1-D6) protein, we identified VCAM-1-D6 as a key domain 
regulating TNFα-induced vascular tube formation. We demonstrated that a 
monoclonal antibody specific to VCAM-1-D6 suppressed TNFα-induced endothelial 
cell migration and tube formation and TNFα-induced vessel sprouting in rat 
aortas. We also found that the antibody insignificantly affected endothelial 
cell viability, morphology and activation. Finally, the antibody specifically 
blocked VCAM-1-mediated cell-cell contacts by directly inhibiting 
VCAM-1-D6-mediated interaction between VCAM-1 molecules. These findings suggest 
that VCAM-1-D6 may be a potential novel therapeutic target in TNFα-induced 
angiogenesis and that antibody-based modulation of VCAM-1-D6 may be an effective 
strategy to suppress TNFα-induced angiogenesis.
