Airway inflammation is the major pathological feature of asthma. Thus, the 
current therapeutic strategy for asthma is to control inflammation. Limethason, 
an anti-inflammation drug, is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The 
aim of the present study was to detect the anti-inflammatory effect and side 
effects of limethason on airways that were sensitized with ovalbumin in a murine 
model of chronic asthma. In the present study, BALB/c mice were sensitized with 
ovalbumin. Airway hyperresponsiveness was estimated, and hematoxylin and eosin 
staining, Periodic acid-Schiff staining and bronchoalveolar lavage were used to 
detect the effect on chronic asthma. Limethason effectively reduced airway 
hyperresponsiveness, and inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus 
secretion. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis revealed that limethason 
suppressed levels of airway eosinophils. In the period of treatment, limethason 
exhibited no influence on morphology of the femoral head, bone mineral content 
or bone mineral density, which were detected by histological studies and 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The index of liver, spleen, kidney, 
gastrocnemius and brown adipose tissue also demonstrated that limethason had no 
adverse effects on organs and tissues. The present study revealed that 
limethason could effectively reduce inflammation in an asthma mouse model 
without side effects. Therefore, limethason may have therapeutic potential for 
treating chronic asthma clinically.
