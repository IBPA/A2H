OBJECTIVE: For the inflammation characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, the 
relative contribution of mediators produced locally in the synovium versus those 
circulating systemically is unknown. Complement factor C3 is made in rheumatoid 
synovium and has been proposed to be a crucial driver of inflammation. The aim 
of this study was to test, in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, whether C3 
synthesized within the synovium is important in promoting inflammation.
METHODS: Radiation bone marrow chimeras between normal and C3(-/-) mice were 
constructed in order to generate animals that expressed or lacked expression of 
C3 only in hematopoietic cells. Parabiotic mice were made by surgically linking 
C3(-/-) mice to irradiated wild-type mice to obtain animals having C3 only in 
the circulation. Arthritis was induced by injection of serum from arthritic 
K/BxN mice.
RESULTS: In bone marrow chimeras, synthesis of C3 by radioresistant cells was 
necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to serum-transferred 
arthritis. Parabionts having C3 only in the circulation remained sensitive to 
arthritis induction, and the cartilage of these arthritic mice contained 
deposits of C3.
CONCLUSION: In a mouse model in which the alternative pathway of complement 
activation is critical to the induction of arthritis by autoantibodies, 
circulating C3 was necessary and sufficient for arthritis induction.
