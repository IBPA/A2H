The antigens that trigger the pathogenic immune response in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) remain unknown. Until recently it was assumed that either viral or 
microbial antigens, or joint-specific antigens were the target of arthritogenic 
T and B lymphocytes in RA. Consequently, murine models of arthritis are induced 
by immunization with either joint-specific antigens such as type II collagen or 
microbial products such as streptococcal cell wall. In the K/BxN T-cell receptor 
transgenic mouse model arthritis is caused by a systemic autoimmune response to 
the ubiquitously expressed glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 
(G6PI). The autoreactive transgenic T cells recognize G6PI and provide help for 
the production of arthritogenic IgG antibodies against G6PI. More recently it 
was shown that G6PI immunization induces severe symmetrical peripheral 
polyarthritis in genetically unaltered DBA/I mice. In that model CD4+ T cells 
are necessary not only for the induction but also for the effector phase of 
arthritis. Here we review the pathomechanisms that lead from systemic 
autoreactivity to arthritis in these models, consider the relevance of anti-G6PI 
immune reactivity for RA, and discuss the insights into the pathogenesis of RA 
and possibly other autoimmune conditions that can be gained from these models.
