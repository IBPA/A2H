The protein tyrosine phosphatase LYP, a key regulator of TCR signaling, presents 
a single nucleotide polymorphism, C1858T, associated with several autoimmune 
diseases such as type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. This 
polymorphism changes an R by a W in the P1 Pro rich motif of LYP, which binds to 
CSK SH3 domain, another negative regulator of TCR signaling. Based on the 
analysis of the mouse homologue, Pep, it was proposed that LYP and CSK bind 
constitutively to inhibit LCK and subsequently TCR signaling. The detailed study 
of LYP/CSK interaction, here presented, showed that LYP/CSK interaction was 
inducible upon TCR stimulation, and involved LYP P1 and P2 motifs, and CSK SH3 
and SH2 domains. Abrogating LYP/CSK interaction did not preclude the regulation 
of TCR signaling by these proteins.
