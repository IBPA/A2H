Survivin is known as an inhibitor of apoptosis and a positive regulator of cell 
division. We have recently identified survivin as a predictor of joint 
destruction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) is 
expressed in the inflamed joints and has adjuvant properties in arthritis. 
Studies on 90 RA patients (median age 60.5 years [range, 24-87], disease 
duration 10.5 years [range, 0-35]) show a strong positive association between 
the levels of survivin and Flt3L in blood. Here, we present experimental 
evidence connecting survivin and Flt3L signaling. Treatment of BALB/c mice with 
Flt3L led to an increase of survivin in the bone marrow and in splenic dendritic 
cells. Flt3L changed the profile of survivin splice variants, increasing 
transcription of the short survivin40 in the bone marrow. Treatment with an Flt3 
inhibitor reduced total survivin expression in bone marrow and in the dendritic 
cell population in spleen. Inhibition of survivin transcription in mice, by 
shRNA lentiviral constructs, reduced the gene expression of Flt3L. We conclude 
that expression of survivin is a downstream event of Flt3 signaling, which 
serves as an essential mechanism supporting survival of leukocytes during their 
differentiation, and maturation of dendritic cells, in RA.
