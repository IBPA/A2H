The interaction of immune complexes with the human Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIa, 
initiates the release of inflammatory mediators and is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus, so this FcR is a potential target for therapy. We 
have used the three-dimensional structure of an FcgammaRIIa dimer to design 
small molecule inhibitors, modeled on a distinct groove and pocket created by 
receptor dimerization, adjacent to the ligand-binding sites. These small 
chemical entities (SCEs) blocked immune complex-induced platelet activation and 
aggregation and tumor necrosis factor secretion from macrophages in a human cell 
line and transgenic mouse macrophages. The SCE appeared specific for 
FcgammaRIIa, as they inhibited only immune complex-induced responses and had no 
effect on responses to stimuli unrelated to FcR, for example platelet 
stimulation with arachidonic acid. In vivo testing of the SCE in FcgammaRIIa 
transgenic mice showed that they inhibited the development and stopped the 
progression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The SCEs were more potent than 
methotrexate and anti-CD3 in sustained suppression of CIA. Thus, in vitro and in 
vivo activity of these SCE FcgammaRIIa receptor antagonists demonstrated their 
potential as anti-inflammatory agents for autoimmune diseases involving immune 
complexes.
