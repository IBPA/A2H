Background The medicinal properties of Inula cappa, a perennial shrub, are 
ascribed to its roots. In this article, we study the anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory activities of I. cappa root extracts based on its utilization 
in traditional medicine-treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, menoxenia, fever, 
jaundice and many others. Methods Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
activities of I. cappa extracts were studied. The anti-inflammatory activity was 
determined by carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and cotton pellet-induced 
granulation method while the immunomodulatory activity was estimated by 
phagocytic assay method, hemagglutinating antibody (HA) titer assay, 
delayed-type hypersensitivity assay method, plaque forming cell assay and 
determination of immunoprophylatic activity. Results The methanolic extract 
showed maximum reduction in the rat paw edema and showed significant inhibition 
of the cotton pellet-induced granulomas in rats. The methanolic extract also 
showed potential immunomodulatory activity in all the assays performed. Two 
sesquiterpenes, isoalantolactone and germacranolide were also isolated from the 
methanolic extract. Conclusions The present study supports the evidence that the 
roots of I. cappa can be used as a potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
agent.
