BACKGROUND: Anti-inflammatory gene therapy is promising in inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have previously demonstrated that 
intra-muscular (i.m.) electrotransfer (ET) of plasmids encoding three different 
human tumor necrosis factor-alpha-soluble receptor I variants (hTNFR-Is) exert 
protective effects in an experimental RA model. However, such a systemic 
approach could be responsible for side effects. The present study aimed at 
performing an intra-articular (i.a.) gene therapy by electrotransfer using the 
hTNFR-Is plasmids.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated targeting of mice joints by CCD optical 
imaging after i.a. ET of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and we showed that ET led 
to strongly increased transgene expression in a plasmid dose-dependent manner. 
Moreover, articular and seric hTNFR-Is was detectable for 2 weeks. As expected, 
systemic hTNFR-Is rates were lower after i.a. ET than after i.m. ET. A longer 
protein secretion could be achieved with several i.a. ETs. Also, we observed 
that hTNFR-Is expression within arthritic joints was slightly higher than in 
normal joints.
CONCLUSIONS: In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for RA, we 
demonstrated that hTNFR-Is/mIgG1-encoding plasmid i.a. ET decreased joint 
destruction in the ankles. In conclusion, our results suggest that local TNFR-Is 
gene therapy may play a role in decreasing joint destruction in CIA.
