CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an 
important costimulatory molecule during the immune response. Here, we report a 
blocking mouse antihuman CD40 monoclonal antibody, mAb 3G3, of which the 
specificity was verified by flow cytometry and Western blot. It was shown by 
competition test that 3G3 bound to a different site (epitope) of CD40 from the 
reported CD40 mAbs, including clone mAb89, 3B2, and 5C11. It was also found that 
mAb 3G3 could inhibit homotypic aggregation of Daudi cells induced by the 
agonistic anti-CD40 mAb 5C11. Furthermore, mAb 3G3 effectively inhibited the 
proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction 
assay. Finally, a sensitive and specific soluble CD40 (sCD40) ELISA kit was 
established by matching mAb 3G3 with 5C11, and it was found that the levels of 
sCD40 in sera from patients with immune disorders such as hyperthyroidism, 
chronic nephritis, and rheumatoid arthritis were obviously higher than those 
from normal individuals. Thus, this blocking anti-CD40 mAb provides a novel tool 
for the study of CD40.
