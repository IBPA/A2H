TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A), also known as TNFSF15, is a member of the TNF 
superfamily. Its known receptor is death receptor 3 (DR3). In humans, TL1A also 
binds to a secreted TNF family member called decoy receptor 3, which interferes 
with the interaction between TL1A and DR3. TL1A/DR3 signal has been implicated 
in several autoimmune diseases in animal models as well as in clinical 
conditions. We generated TL1A gene knockout (KO) mice to assess its role in 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of human rheumatoid arthritis. 
The KO mice were fertile and had no visible anomalies. Their lymphoid organ size 
and cellularity, T and B cell subpopulations, Th cell and regulatory T cell 
development in vivo and in vitro, and antiviral immune responses were comparable 
to those of wild-type mice. However, the KO mice presented ameliorated CIA in 
terms of clinical scores, disease incidence, and pathological scores. The KO 
mice had reduced titers of pathogenic anti-collagen Abs in the sera. No apparent 
defect was found in the function of follicular Th cells. We revealed that plasma 
cells but not B cells expressed high levels of DR3 and were direct targets of 
TL1A. In the presence of TL1A, they survived better and produced more pathogenic 
Ab. This study presented novel knowledge about the role of TL1A in humoral 
immune responses and its mechanism of action in CIA pathogenesis.
