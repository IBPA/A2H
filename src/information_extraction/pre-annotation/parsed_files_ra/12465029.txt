Five protected analogues of beta-D-galactosyl-(5R)-5-hydroxy-L-lysine were 
prepared, in which the galactosyl moiety was modified by monodeoxygenation or 
inversion of stereochemistry at C-4. The building blocks were used in the 
solid-phase synthesis of a set of glycopeptides related to the peptide fragment 
CII256-273 from type II collagen. Evaluation of the glycopeptides revealed that 
T-cell hybridomas obtained in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which is a 
common mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis, recognized the galactosyl moiety 
with high specificity for individual hydroxy groups. Moreover, T-cell hybridomas 
obtained in a humanized variant of CIA were also found to recognize the 
glycopeptides in an equally carbohydrate-specific manner. The results allowed 
the generation of models of the complexes formed between the appropriate class 
II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, glycopeptide, and the T-cell 
receptor, that is, of an interaction that is critical for the stimulation of T 
cells in the arthritis models. In the structural models, peptide side chains 
anchor the glycopeptide in pockets in the class II MHC molecule, whereas the 
galactosylated hydroxylysine residue forms the key contacts with the T-cell 
receptor. Importantly, the results also suggest that a T-cell response towards 
glycopeptide fragments from type II collagen could play an important role in the 
development of rheumatoid arthritis in humans.
