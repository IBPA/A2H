The contributions of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis have not been elucidated. Here, we show that Ahr deficiency 
ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis, a mouse model of RA. Collagen-immunized 
Ahr KO mice showed decreased serum levels of such proinflammatory cytokines as 
IL-1Î² and IL-6. The Th17 and Th1 cell populations in lymph nodes from these mice 
decreased and increased, respectively, whereas the percentage of regulatory T 
cells was unchanged. Interestingly, a lack of Ahr specifically in T cells 
significantly suppressed collagen-induced arthritis development, whereas Ahr 
deficiency in macrophages had no effect. These finding indicate that the 
development of experimental autoimmune arthritis depends on the presence of Ahr 
in T cells, and that Th1/Th17 balance may be particularly important for this 
process.
