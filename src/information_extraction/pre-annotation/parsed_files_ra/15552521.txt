Leflunomide was first shown to have disease-modifying properties in a rat model 
of adjuvant-induced arthritis. Leflunomide has been subsequently used with 
success in several animal models of tissue and organ allograft and of autoimmune 
disease including collagen- and adjuvant-induced arthritis, interstitial 
nephritis, myasthenia gravis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on its 
success as an immunosuppressive agent in these models, leflunomide was tested 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
