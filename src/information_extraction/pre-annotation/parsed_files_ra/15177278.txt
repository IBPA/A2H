Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, 
is involved in many pathological conditions, for example, tumorigenesis, 
diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis. Angiostatin, which contains the 
kringle 1-4 domains of plasminogen, is known to be a potent inhibitor of 
angiogenesis and a strong suppressor of various solid tumors. In this study, we 
expressed recombinant protein containing the kringle 1-3 domains of human 
plasminogen in Escherichia coli and investigated its biological activities. The 
protein was successfully refolded from inclusion bodies and purified at a 30% 
overall yield, as a single peak by HPLC. The purified recombinant protein had 
biochemical properties that were similar to those of the native form, which 
included molecular size, lysine-binding capacity, and immunoreactivity with a 
specific antibody. The recombinant protein was also found to strongly inhibit 
the proliferation of bovine capillary endothelial cells in vitro, and the 
formation of new capillaries on chick embryos. In addition, it suppressed the 
growth of primary Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma in an in vivo mouse 
model. Our findings suggest that the recombinant kringle 1-3 domains in a 
prokaryote expression system have anti-angiogenic activities, which may be 
useful in clinical and basic research in the field of angiogenesis.
