The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse spontaneously develops diabetes and 
sialadenitis. The sialadenitis is characterized by histopathological changes in 
salivary glands and functional deficit similar to Sjögren's syndrome. In humans, 
Sjögren's syndrome could be associated with other connective tissue disorders, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study the genetic control of 
sialadenitis in mice was compared to that of arthritis. We have previously 
reported a NOD locus, identified in an F2 cross with the H2(q) congenic NOD 
(NOD.Q) and C57BL/10.Q (B10.Q) strains, that promoted susceptibility to 
collagen-induced arthritis. The sialadenitis in NOD.Q showed a similar 
histological phenotype as in NOD, whereas no submandibular gland infiltration 
was found in B10.Q. The development of sialadenitis was independent of 
immunization with type II collagen and established arthritis. To identify the 
genetic control of sialadenitis, a gene segregation experiment was performed on 
an (NOD.QxB10.Q)F2 cross and genetic mapping of 353 F2 mice revealed one 
significant locus associated with sialadenitis on chromosome 4, LOD score 4.7. 
The NOD.Q allele-mediated susceptibility under a recessive inheritance pattern. 
The genetic control of sialadenitis seemed to be unique in comparison to 
diabetes and arthritis, as no loci associated with these diseases have been 
identified at the same location.
