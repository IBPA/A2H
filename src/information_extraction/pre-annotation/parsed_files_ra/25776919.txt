The discovery of Th17 cells, along with many other Th cell subsets in the recent 
years, has expanded the Th1/Th2 paradigm that had persisted since its 
proposition by Mosmann in 1986. Defined by the characteristic expression of the 
transcription factor retinoic-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) and production 
of IL-17A (IL-17), Th17 cells are powerful inducers of tissue inflammation with 
a recognized role against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Despite this, the 
interest in their study came from the pivotal role they play in the development 
and maintenance of major chronic inflammatory conditions such as multiple 
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, hence they have been the 
target of promising new anti-Th17 therapies. Accordingly, the identification of 
opportunistic pathogens whose clearance relies on the Th17 response is of huge 
prophylactic importance. As shown here for the first time, this applies to 
Sporothrix schenckii, a thermo-dimorphic fungus and the causative agent of 
sporotrichosis. Our results show that both Th17 and Th1/Th17 mixed cells are 
developed during the S. schenckii systemic mice infection, which also leads to 
augmented production of IL-17 and IL-22. Also, by using an antibody-mediated 
IL-23 depletion model, we further demonstrate that optimal fungal clearance, but 
not survival, depends on an intact Th17 response.
