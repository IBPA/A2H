ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Aconitum carmichaelii (AC) is a common herbal 
medicine used as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent in Eastern Asia. In 
Korea, a commercial processed AC (Aconibal®) is traditionally used to treat the 
symptoms of spondylosis deformans and rheumatic pain.
AIM OF STUDY: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is systemic and autoimmune disease 
characterized by chronic inflammation. Methotrexate (MTX) is often the 
first-line therapy for RA. If MTX monotherapy is ineffective or RA is initially 
severe, adding a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor to the treatment 
can be beneficial. However, its inhibitory effects on RA when combined with MTX 
are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the stable modulation of and synergistic 
to additive effect on TNF-α using AC combined with MTX (AMC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An inflammatory response mimicking RA was induced in the 
mouse macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 using interferon-γ or lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS). We predicted that AC and MTX at a 3:1 ratio would have synergistic 
therapeutic effects and this was determined using the Chou-Talalay method of 
median effect analysis and CalcuSyn software. We analyzed the profiles of 
various inflammatory cytokine-related proteins using Search tool for retrieval 
of interacting genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
RESULTS: The expression levels of selected inflammatory immune mediators such as 
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1α, chemokine ligand 5, granulocyte-colony stimulating 
factor, nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase were reduced via regulation of 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. AMC inhibited the levels 
of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -3 in the human synovial cell line SW982.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time the potential beneficial effects 
of AMC in RA management.
