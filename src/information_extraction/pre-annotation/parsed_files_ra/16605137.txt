A pathogenic role for autoantibodies, immune complexes and mast cells has long 
been hypothesized in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies demonstrating 
novel RA-associated autoantibodies and the efficacy of B cell-directed therapy 
have led to a renewed interest in the role of humoral immunity in RA. Mouse 
models of arthritis have provided further support for a direct pathogenic role 
of autoantibodies in the development of synovial inflammation. Interestingly, in 
antibody-mediated K/BxN serum transfer arthritis, mast cells have now been 
identified as a critical cellular mediator of autoantibody-driven joint 
inflammation. Here, we focus on the role of autoantibodies and mast cells in 
murine and human inflammatory arthritis.
