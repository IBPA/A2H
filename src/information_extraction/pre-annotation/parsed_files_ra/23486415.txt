OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor 
inhibition in a mouse model of autoantibody-mediated arthritis.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by K/BxN serum transfer. 
Arthritic mice were treated with the LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425 and 
arthritis severity was assessed clinically and histologically. Expression of 
inflammatory mediators in joints was identified by a mouse cytokine array and 
validated by western blot and real-time PCR assays. Effects of treatment with 
LPA receptor antagonist or with small interfering RNA on bone metabolism were 
assessed by in vitro assays of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, osteoblasts 
differentiation and bone mineralisation.
RESULTS: Mice treated with the LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 showed attenuated 
arthritis characterised by reduction of synovial inflammation, cartilage damage 
and, more markedly, bone erosion. We detected increased apoptosis, reduction of 
inflammatory mediators and of bone remodelling proteins in arthritic joints from 
mice treated with Ki16425. In addition, we demonstrated that inhibition or 
suppression of LPA1 receptor reduces osteoclast differentiation and bone 
resorption and, on the contrary, it promotes differentiation of osteoblasts and 
bone mineralisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological inhibition of LPA1 receptor in the K/BxN 
serum-transfer arthritis model led to reduction of severity of arthritis 
involving multiple mechanisms, increased apoptosis, reduced inflammatory 
mediators and proteins involved in bone remodelling, that show LPA1 as a very 
promising target in rheumatoid arthritis treatment.
