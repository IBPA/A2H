Therapeutic effects of HL for a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse models of 
HL-23 composed of 95mol% l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 5mol% 
polyoxyethylenedodecylether (C12(EO)23) in vivo were examined. Remarkably high 
therapeutic effects of HL-23 for CIA mouse models were obtained on the basis of 
clinical assessment of arthritis. The reduction of hyperplastic synovial 
membrane (pannus tissue) and destruction of the cartilage and bone by HL-23 was 
revealed on the basis of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and safranin O staining. 
Furthermore, the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 
(IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 for CIA mouse models treated 
with HL-23 were investigated. Remarkably high therapeutic effects without joint 
swelling were obtained in CIA mouse models treated with HL-23.
