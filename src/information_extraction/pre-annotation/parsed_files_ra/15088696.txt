Traditionally S. anacardium is used for rejuvenation, rheumatoid arthritis, 
fever and neurological disorders. In the present study it was observed that a 
fraction of S. anacacrdium at dose of 1 mg/100 g body wt, significantly reduced 
serum cholesterol from 378.87 mg/dl in the rats fed with atherogenic diet (AD) 
to 197.99 mg/dl (45-52%) in the rats fed with AD diet and increased serum 
HDL-cholesterol (33-37%). The same fraction also inhibited LPS induced NO 
production in the culture activated rat peritoneal macrophages in the dose 
dependent manner with IC50 value at 50 ng/ml of the culture medium. The drug in 
the above doses was completely safe and non-toxic, (no change in the enzymes), 
to liver and kidney functions.
