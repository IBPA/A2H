Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a key member of the TGF-β superfamily, 
plays critical roles in various medical conditions. Recently, GDF11 was found to 
suppress the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) signaling pathway and protect against inflammation. This study aimed to 
investigate the role of GDF11 in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
We demonstrated that GDF11 treatment antagonized TNF-α-induced inflammation in 
macrophages. Moreover, GDF11 inhibited the development of arthritis in the 
collagen-induced arthritis and collagen antibody-induced arthritis models. Local 
gene transfer of GDF11 via adeno-associated virus exerted therapeutic effects, 
while local knockdown of GDF11 exaggerated inflammation in our collagen-induced 
arthritis model, as detected by expression levels of inflammatory biomarkers and 
the destruction of joint structures. Additionally, the results from both in 
vitro experiments and luciferase reporter gene mouse experiments implied that 
the NF-κB pathway might play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of GDF11 
in RA. This study presents GDF11 as a potential target for the treatment of 
inflammatory arthritis, including RA.-Li, W., Wang, W., Liu, L., Qu, R., Chen, 
X., Qiu, C., Li, J., Hayball, J., Liu, L., Chen, J., Wang, X., Pan, X., Zhao, Y. 
GDF11 antagonizes TNF-α-induced inflammation and protects against the 
development of inflammatory arthritis in mice.
