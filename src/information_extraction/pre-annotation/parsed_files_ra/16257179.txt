Proteoglycan (PG)-induced arthritis (PGIA), a murine model for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), is driven by antigen (PG)-specific T and B cell activation. In 
order to analyze the pathogenic role of antigen-specific T cells in the 
development of autoimmune arthritis, we have generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse. 
The CD4(+) T cells of this TCR-5/4E8-Tg line express a functional T cell 
receptor (TCR) composed of the Valpha1.1 and Vbeta4 chains with specificity for 
the dominant arthritogenic T cell epitope of human cartilage PG. Adoptive 
transfer of naive TCR-5/4E8-Tg cells induced arthritis with severe clinical 
symptoms in syngeneic immunodeficient BALB/c.RAG2(-/-) mice. In vivo activation 
of TCR-5/4E8-Tg CD4(+)Vbeta4(+) cells with cartilage PG seemed to be critical 
for arthritis induction. Arthritis never developed after transfer of naive 
wild-type cells. The arthritis was characterized as a chronic progressive 
disease with intermittent spontaneous exacerbations and remissions. Inflamed 
joints showed extensive cartilage damage and bone erosions leading to massive 
ankylosis in peripheral joints. These PG epitope-specific TCR-5/4E8-Tg mice can 
be valuable research tools for studying antigen-driven T cell regulation in 
arthritis, and migration of T cells to the joints. In addition the model may be 
used for the development of immune modulating strategies in T cell-mediated 
autoimmune diseases.
