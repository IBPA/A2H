Ectopic lymphoid follicles are a key feature of chronic inflammatory autoimmune 
and infectious diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and 
Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis. Homeostatic chemokines are considered to 
be involved in the formation of such tertiary lymphoid tissue. High expression 
of CXCL13 and its receptor, CXCR5, has been associated with the formation of 
ectopic lymphoid follicles in chronic infectious diseases. Here, we defined the 
role of CXCR5 in the development of mucosal tertiary lymphoid tissue and gastric 
inflammation in a mouse model of chronic H. pylori infection. CXCR5-deficient 
mice failed to develop organized gastric lymphoid follicles despite similar 
bacterial colonization density as infected wild-type mice. CXCR5 deficiency 
altered Th17 responses but not Th1-type cellular immune responses to H. pylori 
infection. Furthermore, CXCR5-deficient mice exhibited lower H. pylori-specific 
serum IgG and IgA levels and an overall decrease in chronic gastric immune 
responses. In conclusion, the development of mucosal tertiary ectopic follicles 
during chronic H. pylori infection is strongly dependent on the CXCL13/CXCR5 
signaling axis, and lack of de novo lymphoid tissue formation attenuates chronic 
immune responses.
