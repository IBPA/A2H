Antigen presentation to T cells by MHC molecules is essential for adaptive 
immune responses. To determine the exact position of a gene affecting expression 
of MHC molecules, we finely mapped a previously defined rat quantitative trait 
locus regulating MHC class II on microglia in an advanced intercross line. We 
identified a small interval including the gene MHC class II transactivator 
(Mhc2ta) and, using a map over six inbred strains combined with gene sequencing 
and expression analysis, two conserved Mhc2ta haplotypes segregating with MHC 
class II levels. In humans, a -168A --> G polymorphism in the type III promoter 
of the MHC class II transactivator (MHC2TA) was associated with increased 
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and myocardial 
infarction, as well as lower expression of MHC2TA after stimulation of 
leukocytes with interferon-gamma. We conclude that polymorphisms in Mhc2ta and 
MHC2TA result in differential MHC molecule expression and are associated with 
susceptibility to common complex diseases with inflammatory components.
