Angiogenesis is a necessary component of normal tissue repair, tumor growth and 
dissemination, and a wide variety of other inflammatory and pathological 
processes as well, including diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
psoriasis. Consequently, the last two decades have seen extensive research into 
the regulation of neovascularization, particularly in tumors. Partly due to the 
emphasis on tumor angiogenesis, much of this effort has been devoted to the 
detection and characterization of angiogenic growth factors and inhibitory 
molecules. Thus assays have commonly been developed to measure the amount of 
vascular growth in vivo, or the modulation of endothelial cell (EC) 
proliferation, or migration in simple 2D culture systems (1).
