Autoantibodies of the IgG class and the immune complexes they form are central 
players in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Receptors for the Fc part 
of IgG, FcgammaR constitute one of the main effector mechanisms through which 
IgG immune complexes exert their action. The different members of the FcgammaR 
family exhibit extensive structural homology leading to redundancy in ligand 
specificity and signal transduction. Moreover, the initiation of effector 
mechanisms by IgG immune complexes can also be mediated by the complement 
system. This strong redundancy and high degree of complexity hampers a direct in 
vivo analysis of antibody effector pathways. Over the last decade, mice 
deficient for different combinations of FcgammaR have been generated by gene 
targeting. These knockout mice provide excellent tools to define the specific 
contribution of the different FcgammaR to IgG effector pathways in 
well-established in vivo mouse models for arthritis. This review will discuss 
the results of the studies that analyze the role of the different members of the 
FcgammaR family in murine arthritis models and their implications for our 
understanding of the human disease.
