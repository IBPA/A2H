To study the mechanism and inhibitory effect of Saposhnikovia divaricata 
polysaccharide (SDP) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from 
rheumatoid arthritis rat model. Rheumatoid arthritis rat model was established 
by the classical composite factors including wind, cold, damp plus biological 
agents. The synovial tissues were digested with trypsin to isolate FLS cells. 
The different dosage of SDP was applied in culture. The cell viability was 
evaluated by MTT assay and the apoptosis was determined by analytic flow 
cytometry. The expression change of p53 gene was monitored by RT-PCR method. The 
production of secretory inflammation factors TNF-α and IL-1β were determined by 
ELISA. The proliferative and apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, 
MMP-1, MMP-3, P53 were measured by western blotting. Our data demonstrated that 
treatment with high concentration of SDP could enhance the expression of P53 at 
both mRNA (P<0.05) and protein (P<0.05) level, inhibit the secretion of TNF-α 
(P<0.05) and IL-1β (P<0.05). Simultaneously, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and level of 
MMP-1, MMP-3 was significantly decreased, and apoptotic marker caspase-3 protein 
was increased. In addition, the FACS analysis consistently consolidated the 
apoptosis-inducing effect of SDP on RAFLS. SDP could significantly inhibit 
dysplasia of RAFLS via modulation of p53 expression and suppression of 
inflammatory factors, which suggested a potential therapeutic value for 
rheumatoid arthritis.
