The C5a receptor (C5aR) is a 7 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 
that mediates the powerful pro-inflammatory effect of the complement activation 
product C5a. Excess C5a generated under pathological conditions has been 
implicated in a variety of conditions including sepsis, asthma and rheumatoid 
arthritis, but very little is known about the regulation of expression of the 
C5aR. The 5' promoter region and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the C5aR mRNA 
were cloned, generating enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-reporter 
plasmids, which were transfected into the monocytic cell line U937. Most of the 
cloned 2kb 5' region was dispensable for the expression of the reporter 
constructs and the majority of regulatory sequences are in the first 200 bp. 
Three motifs, a NFÎºB, a CCAAT and a NFAT site, were identified to be of 
importance by site directed mutagenesis for basal expression. Analysis of the 
3'UTR of the C5aR mRNA showed that it contained two AU-rich elements (AREs), 
however site directed mutagenesis showed that these had no effect on basal 
expression. While the phorbol ester PMA and dibutyryl cAMP increased C5aR 
protein expression, these agents had no effect on the regulation of expression 
via the promoter or the 3'UTR. This is the first study to investigate the role 
of both the promoter and 3'UTR in regulating C5aR expression and our results 
show that regulation of the human C5aR is similar but not identical to that of 
the mouse C5aR.
