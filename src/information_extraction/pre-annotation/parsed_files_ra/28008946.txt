Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is related to the 
induction of T helper (Th)17 cells, which secrete interleukin-17, and activation 
of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. The expression 
of high-temperature requirement protein A (HtrA) 2, a serine protease involved 
in apoptosis, was decreased in RA patients nonresponsive to drug treatment of 
RA. The aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression of HtrA2 has a 
therapeutic effect on RA. Th17 differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, and 
lymphocyte activation are increased in motor neuron degeneration (mnd)2 mice, 
which lack HtrA2 activity because of a missense mutation (Ser276Cys) in the 
protease domain of HtrA2. The inhibitor of HtrA2 also increased Th17 
differentiation. On the other hand, HtrA2 induced cleavage of STAT3 and 
overexpression of HtrA2 attenuated CIA in a mouse model. HtrA2 overexpression 
inhibited plaque development as well as the differentiation of Th17 in ApoE-/- 
mice after immunization with proteoglycans to induce a hyperlipidemia-based RA 
animal model. The therapeutic function of HtrA2 in inflammatory diseases is 
linked with Th17 development and the STAT3 pathway in splenocytes. These results 
suggest that HtrA2 participates in immunomodulatory activity where the 
upregulation of HtrA2 may shed light on therapeutic approaches to RA and 
hyperlipidemia.
