OBJECTIVE: To describe the kinetics of leukocyte migration into a distal joint 
during the development of chronic inflammation in a murine model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), to identify leukocyte subpopulations recruited in the synovial 
vessels, and to test in real time the effects of an antiinflammatory compound on 
leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in the arthritic joint.
METHODS: We used intravital video microscopy (IVM), which was adapted to the 
microcirculation of the mouse ankle, to monitor the kinetics of 
leukocyte-endothelium interactions (rolling and firm adhesion) during the onset 
and progression of proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA), a chronic autoimmune 
model of RA. Subpopulations of rolling and adherent leukocytes were identified 
by in vivo immunostaining. Leukocyte extravasation into the ankle joint was 
verified histologically.
RESULTS: Between the onset of arthritis and the beginning of the destructive 
phase of PGIA, we found a steady increase in the number of leukocytes that 
exhibited firm adherence to the endothelium of synovial vessels, which clearly 
underscores the chronic, self-perpetuating character of joint inflammation in 
this autoimmune model. We showed, however, that granulocytes, and not T cells, 
constituted the major cell population that was continuously recruited to the 
inflamed ankle. Using IVM, we could detect instant changes in leukocyte adhesion 
behavior in the synovial vessels of the arthritic joint upon administration of a 
compound that antagonizes leukocyte rolling.
CONCLUSION: IVM of the microcirculation of the mouse ankle could become an 
essential tool for investigating the mechanisms that regulate leukocyte 
migration to the joint in systemic models of RA as well as for preclinical 
testing of antiinflammatory therapies.
