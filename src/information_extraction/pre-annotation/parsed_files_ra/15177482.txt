A library of trisubstituted oxazoles, thiazoles, imidazoles (1,2,4- and 
2,4,5-substituted) and imidazo[1,2-b]pyridines was prepared and evaluated in 
vitro as p38alpha inhibitors and in vivo in several models of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Four structures--32, 37, 45 and 59--were identified as potent 
inhibitors of p38alpha with high efficacy in the LPS induced TNFalpha release 
model in the mouse, the adjuvant induced arthritis and the collagen induced 
arthritis in the rat with ED50s between 1.0 and 9.5 mg/kg p.o.
