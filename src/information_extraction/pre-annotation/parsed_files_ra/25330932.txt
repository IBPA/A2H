OBJECTIVE: Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 4 (RasGRP-4) is a 
calcium-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor and diacylglycerol/phorbol 
ester receptor not normally expressed in fibroblasts. While RasGRP-4-null mice 
are resistant to arthritis induced by anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 
autoantibodies, the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. We 
undertook this study to evaluate the importance of RasGRP-4 in the pathogenesis 
of human and rat arthritis.
METHODS: Synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
osteoarthritis (OA) were evaluated immunohistochemically for the presence of 
RasGRP-4 protein. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated from synovial 
samples, and expression of RasGRP-4 was evaluated by real-time quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses. The proliferation 
potency of FLS was evaluated by exposing the cells to a RasGRP-4-specific small 
interfering RNA (siRNA). Finally, the ability of RasGRP-4-specific siRNAs to 
hinder type II collagen-induced arthritis in rats was evaluated to confirm the 
importance of the signaling protein in the disease.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly, RasGRP-4 protein was detected in the synovial 
hyperplastic lining, where proliferating FLS preferentially reside. FLS isolated 
from tissues obtained from a subpopulation of RA patients expressed much more 
RasGRP-4 than did FLS from examined OA patients. Moreover, the level of RasGRP-4 
transcript was correlated with the FLS proliferation rate. The ability of 
cultured FLS to divide was diminished when they were treated with 
RasGRP-4-specific siRNAs. The intraarticular injection of RasGRP-4-specific 
siRNAs also dampened experimental arthritis in rats.
CONCLUSION: RasGRP-4 is aberrantly expressed in FLS and helps regulate their 
growth. This intracellular signaling protein is therefore a candidate target for 
dampening proliferative synovitis and joint destruction.
