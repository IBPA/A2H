Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on a highly potent series of 
arylamide FMS inhibitors were carried out with the aim of improving FMS kinase 
selectivity, particularly over KIT. Potent compound 17r (FMS IC50 0.7 nM, FMS 
cell IC50 6.1 nM) was discovered that had good PK properties and a greater than 
fivefold improvement in selectivity for FMS over KIT kinase in a cellular assay 
relative to the previously reported clinical candidate 4. This improved 
selectivity was manifested in vivo by no observed decrease in circulating 
reticulocytes, a measure of bone safety, at the highest studied dose. Compound 
17r was highly active in a mouse pharmacodynamic model and demonstrated 
disease-modifying effects in a dose-dependent manner in a strep cell 
wall-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis in rats.
