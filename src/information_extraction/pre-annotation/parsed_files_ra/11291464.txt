Infliximab, a chimeric mouse human monoclonal antibody, is an anti-TNF treatment 
for rheumatoid arthritis. In the past there was a sizeable group of people who 
had exhausted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and were left 
largely untreated. This has been revolutionized by treatments such as infliximab 
which have been shown to be effective for patients in whom standard DMARDs have 
failed.
