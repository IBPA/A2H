Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory, angiogenic disease. 
Inflamed synovitis is a hallmark of RA which is hypoxic in nature. Vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the key regulators of angiogenesis, is 
overexpressed in the pathogenesis of RA. VEGF expression is regulated by 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a master regulator of homeostasis 
which plays a pivotal role in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. In this study we 
show that synthetic benzophenone analogue, 2-benzoyl-phenoxy acetamide (BP-1) 
can act as a novel anti-arthritic agent in an experimental adjuvant induced 
arthritis (AIA) rat model by targeting VEGF and HIF-1alpha. BP-1 administered 
hypoxic endothelial cells and arthritic animals clearly showed down regulation 
of VEGF expression. Further, BP-1 inhibits nuclear translocation of HIF-1alpha, 
which in turn suppresses transcription of the VEGF gene. These results suggest a 
further possible clinical application of the BP-1 derivative as an 
anti-arthritic agent in association with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
