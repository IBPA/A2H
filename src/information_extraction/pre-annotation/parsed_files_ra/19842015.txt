The root of Clematis chinensis Osbeck has been used widely in rheumatoid 
arthritis in Chinese traditional medicine and AR-6 is a triterpene saponin 
isolated from it. In this present study, we investigated in vivo effects of oral 
AR-6 in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) and in vitro effect in 
macrophage and synoviocytes cells. Arthritic scores and serum inflammatory 
mediators were evaluated 19 days after AA induction by endermic injection of 
Freund's complete adjuvant in Sprague-Dawley(S-D) rats. Oral administration of 
AR-6 to arthritic rats resulted in a clear decrease of clinical signs compared 
to untreated controls. The synoviocyte and macrophage response ex vivo were then 
analyzed. Anti-arthritic effects of AR-6 correlated with significant decrease of 
NO and TNF-alpha produced by peritoneal macrophages, ex vivo and in vitro. AR-6 
also significant decreased the proliferation of synoviocyte. These data indicate 
that AR-6 is a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic and preventive agent.
