The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is approved for treating 
rheumatoid arthritis and has the potential to treat metastatic cancers involving 
excess amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1). To 
maintain sustained delivery and improve its therapeutic efficacy, IL-1Ra was 
encapsulated with stabilizers in biodegradable poly-(lactic/glycolic acid) 
(PLGA) microspheres. In vitro cytokine release and bioactivity studies in 
cultured melanoma B16 cells revealed the microspheres to be capable of sustained 
IL-1Ra release on a daily level that could inhibit cell proliferation for at 
least 7 days. The level of IL-1Ra released from the microspheres was revealed in 
rat serum. Significant amounts of IL-1Ra were released over the course of 2 
weeks, at levels sufficient for the inhibition of exogenously-administered IL-1 
beta. In mice injected with B16 melanoma cells, the sustained IL-1Ra delivery 
from biodegradable microspheres inhibited tumor growth and significantly 
prolonged mice survival. Furthermore, the tumors were less vascularized and 
after amputation of the primary tumor, the number of lung metastases was reduced 
by 70%, as compared to the control groups. Thus, we show that biodegradable 
microspheres represent an efficient system for sustaining IL-1Ra delivery and 
improving its therapeutic efficacy. As such, the system can be integrated into 
therapeutic protocols for treating metastatic cancers.
