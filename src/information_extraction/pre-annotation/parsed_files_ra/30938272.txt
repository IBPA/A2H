The expression levels of cytokines and chemokines are strictly regulated at 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These small proteins are 
closely related to inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
purpose of this review is to highlight the potential utilization of 
tristetraprolin (TTP) as a therapeutic target in treating RA. TTP is the most 
notable and well-characterized RNA-binding protein that destabilizes mRNA of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. TTP is thought to play an important role in RA 
because its target mRNA includes a lot of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFÎ±. 
Post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, seem to be 
critical for the anti-inflammatory effects of TTP. Importantly, various mouse 
models, many of which are consistent with in vitro studies, are now available to 
elicit a more detailed understanding of the pathogenic role of TTP. The results 
of these multidisciplinary studies indicate that it is possible to improve 
inflammation by controlling TTP activity. Through this review, I propose that 
the use of recently developed mouse models and establishment of clever designs 
to target TTP will greatly contribute to future drug development to treat RA.
