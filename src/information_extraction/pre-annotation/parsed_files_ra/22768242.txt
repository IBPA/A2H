Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that 
principally attacks synovial joints, afflicts over 2 million people in the 
United States. Interleukin (IL)-17 is considered to be a master cytokine in 
chronic, destructive arthritis. Levels of the ganglioside GM3, one of the most 
primitive glycosphingolipids containing a sialic acid in the structure, are 
remarkably decreased in the synovium of patients with RA. Based on the increased 
cytokine secretions observed in in vitro experiments, GM3 might have an 
immunologic role. Here, to clarify the association between RA and GM3, we 
established a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model using the null mutation of 
the ganglioside GM3 synthase gene. GM3 deficiency exacerbated inflammatory 
arthritis in the mouse model of RA. In addition, disrupting GM3 induced T cell 
activation in vivo and promoted overproduction of the cytokines involved in RA. 
In contrast, the amount of the GM3 synthase gene transcript in the synovium was 
higher in patients with RA than in those with osteoarthritis. These findings 
indicate a crucial role for GM3 in the pathogenesis and progression of RA. 
Control of glycosphingolipids such as GM3 might therefore provide a novel 
therapeutic strategy for RA.
