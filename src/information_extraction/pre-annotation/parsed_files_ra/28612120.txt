OBJECTIVE: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis experience nociceptive as well as 
neuropathic pain. The effect of iguratimod (IGU), a disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drug, on neuropathic pain in a rat model of chronic constriction 
injury (CCI) was examined in this study.
METHODS: CCI was induced by making four ligations on the left sciatic nerve. 
Rats with stable signs of static allodynia were selected 2 weeks after the 
surgery and drug treatments were started (day 0). The test drugs were orally 
administered once daily for 15 days. The threshold of mechanical pain response 
in the hind paw was evaluated by the von Frey hair test in a blinded manner. To 
observe histological changes in the spinal cord, the L4 region was subjected to 
immunohistochemical analysis for the detection of microglial cells.
RESULTS: IGU showed an anti-allodynic effect on CCI-induced neuropathic pain at 
days 6 and 14, but not at 90 min after the first administration of IGU. This 
effect of IGU was observed until day 21. Furthermore, IGU decreased the number 
of Iba-1-positive cells, which had been increased at the ipsilateral side of the 
dorsal horn by CCI.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IGU suppresses neuropathic pain via a 
different mechanism from that of current therapeutics.
