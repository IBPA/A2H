Triptolide has been clinically used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
in which chemokine receptors play an important role in immune and inflammatory 
responses. To investigate the effect of triptolide on CCR5, we used complete 
Freund's adjuvant to produce adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. Our data 
show that both CCR5 mRNA and protein levels in synovial tissue of rats with AIA 
are significantly higher than those in normal rats. Triptolide can significantly 
inhibit rat AIA-induced overexpression of CCR5 at both mRNA and protein levels. 
These results may contribute to better understanding of the therapeutic effects 
of triptolide in rheumatoid arthritis.
