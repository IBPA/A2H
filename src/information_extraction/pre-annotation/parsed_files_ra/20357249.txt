CXCL2 has been known to regulate immune functions mainly by chemo-attracting 
neutrophils. In this study, we show that CXCL2 can be induced by receptor 
activator of NF-kappaB ligand, the osteoclast (OC) differentiation factor, 
through JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in OC precursor cells. CXCL2 in 
turn enhanced the proliferation of OC precursor cells of bone marrow-derived 
macrophages (BMMs) through the activation of ERK. Knockdown of CXCL2 inhibited 
both the proliferation of and the ERK activation in BMMs. During 
osteoclastogenesis CXCL2 stimulated the adhesion and the migration of BMMs. 
Moreover, the formation of OCs from BMMs was significantly increased on 
treatment with CXCL2. Conversely, the CXCL2 antagonist repertaxin and a CXCL2 
neutralizing Ab potently reduced receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand-induced 
osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, CXCL2 evoked fulminant bone erosion in the in 
vivo mouse experiments. Finally, prominent upregulation of CXCL2 was detected in 
synovial fluids and sera from rheumatoid arthritis patients, suggesting a 
potential involvement of CXCL2-mediated osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid 
arthritis-associated bone destruction. Thus, CXCL2 is a novel therapeutic target 
for inflammatory bone destructive diseases.
