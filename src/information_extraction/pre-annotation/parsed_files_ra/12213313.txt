Aurothioglucose (ATG) is presently employed both by clinicians in the treatment 
of advanced rheumatoid arthritis and by neuroscience researchers to generate 
lesions around the circumventricular organs (CVOs) of rodent brains, resulting 
in obese animals. Although the existence of such lesions is well documented, 
there is relatively little information concerning the changes over time of the 
different cell types in the regions surrounding the CVOs. To address this 
question, specific markers allowing identification of four distinct cellular 
populations were used to characterize respective changes over time. Generally, 
regions adjacent to the CVOs were more vulnerable than the CVOs themselves, 
while more caudal structures were more frequently lesioned than more anterior 
CVO regions. Vascular and glial cells appeared to be the initial targets of ATG, 
while neuronal cell death occurred subsequent to the inflammatory response. The 
results of this study help resolve the mechanism of ATG toxicity as reflected by 
a cascade of pathologies that is consistent with disparate cell types exhibiting 
specific changes at specific times.
