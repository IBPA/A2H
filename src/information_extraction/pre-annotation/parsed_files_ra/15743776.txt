Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common and most debilitating joint 
diseases, producing high personal, social, and economic costs.(1,2) Patients 
with RA suffer pain and functional losses, often followed by disability and 
premature death. Although the etiology of RA is unknown, substantial efforts 
have been directed toward studying the transition of the joint from normal to 
diseased. The maintenance of normal joint architecture and function requires 
equilibrium between the synthesis and degradation of the specialized 
extracellular matrices that make up bone, cartilage, and tendons. In RA, the 
balance of tissue remodeling is disturbed,(3) and excessive proteolytic 
degradation of the joint matrices leads to joint destruction.(4,5) The early 
phase of RA is characterized by the infiltration of immune and inflammatory 
cells into the synovium and by hyperplasia of the fibroblasts in the synovial 
lining. This leads to pannus formation, cartilage breakdown, and eventual bone 
destruction.(1,2) Through the use of an experimental mouse model of RA, Li and 
colleagues(6) have implicated plasmin as an essential component of the early 
phase of RA, as reported in this issue of The American Journal of Pathology.
