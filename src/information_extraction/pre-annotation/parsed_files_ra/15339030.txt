Leukotrienes play a part in inflammatory response. The unique role of the enzyme 
5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in the production of leukotrienes makes it a likely 
therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions like asthma, rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the effect of zileuton, an orally active selective 
5-LOX inhibitor against the events associated with dextran sodium 
sulphate-induced colitis in a rat model of IBD. The animals were administered 
simultaneously zileuton (100mg/kg) or sulphasalazine (100mg/kg) orally for 7 
days. On day eight, rats were sacrificed, and distal colon isolated to determine 
myeloperoxidase activity, in vivo superoxide dismutase activity, prostaglandin 
E2 levels and histological examination. Both zileuton and sulphasalazine 
significantly prevented the development of inflammatory events associated with 
colitis. The effect of zileuton was more pronounced towards reducing 
myeloperoxidase activity and increasing PGE2 levels in distal colon. The results 
show that chemotactic leukotrienes are responsible for inflammatory surge in 
damaged colon and, zileuton, significantly improved healing by inhibition of 
neutrophil recruitment and indirectly through increase in prostaglandins at the 
site of inflammation. It is suggested that inhibitors of 5-LOX enzyme may have 
useful therapeutic role in the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation.
