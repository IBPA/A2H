Ninety-six patients with rheumatoid arthritis(RA) on active phase were divided 
into BZX-treated group(BZXG) and methotrexate-treated group(MTXG). The results 
showed that after 1-month treatment, symptoms and signs, such as joint 
tenderness, arthralgia, arthroncus, of patients in BZXG improved notably(P < 
0.01 or P < 0.05), while those of patients in MTXG did not improve, there was 
significant difference between these two groups(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). After 
3-month treatment, these symptoms and signs improved in both groups(P < 0.01 or 
P < 0.05), but BZX had a better effect than MTX. ESR, CRP, RF, C3, IgG, IgA and 
IgM decreased significantly in both groups after treatment(P < 0.01 or P < 
0.05), ESR, CRP in BZXG decreased more and faster than those in MTXG. In BZXG 
the obviously efficient rat was 70%, the total efficacy rate was 94%, while in 
MTXG was 52% and 87% respectively. It is indicated that BZX can improve symptoms 
and signs of patients with RA, has better and faster effects on acute phase 
reaction than MTX; and it has anti-immunologic effects similar to MTX, and has 
no obvious side effect.
