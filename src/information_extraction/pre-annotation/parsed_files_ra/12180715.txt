OBJECTIVE: To characterize the adenoviral properties required to enhance 
intracellular transgene expression for gene therapy.
METHODS: Primary human fibroblasts and macrophages were infected with standard 
replication-defective adenoviruses, adenoviral vectors containing modified fiber 
coat proteins expressing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or heparin sulfate binding moieties, 
or a tetracycline-regulatable transgene transcription system. Each of these 
vectors expressed the beta-galactosidase gene (beta-Gal), which was quantified 
by flow cytometry. Ankle joints from rats with adjuvant induced arthritis were 
transduced intraarticularly with each of the vectors and B-Gal expression was 
quantified by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Primary human fibroblasts and macrophages displayed marked increases in 
transgene expression from both modified fiber protein vectors and from the 
tetracycline-regulatable vector, compared to an unmodified vector expressing the 
transgene from the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer. In the rat model, the 
modified fiber protein vectors and the tetracycline-regulatable vector system 
also displayed increased transgene expression in inflamed rat joints.
CONCLUSION: Adenovirus attachment and uptake by cells and promoter strength 
limit transgene expression from conventional adenoviral vectors in models of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
