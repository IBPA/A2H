Bacopa monniera (L.) Wettst is an Ayurvedic herb with antirheumatic potential. 
This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Bacopa monniera in treating 
rheumatoid arthritis using a type II collagen-induced arthritis rat model. 
Arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by immunization with bovine type II 
collagen in complete Freund's adjuvant. Bacopa monniera extract (BME) was 
administered after the development of arthritis from day 14 onwards. The total 
duration of experiment was 60 days. Paw swelling, arthritic index, inflammatory 
mediators such as cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, myeloperoxidase and serum 
anti-collagen IgG and IgM levels were analysed in control and experimental rats. 
Arthritic induction significantly increased paw edema and other classical signs 
of arthritis coupled to upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as 
cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, neutrophil infiltration and increased 
anti-collagen IgM and IgG levels in serum. BME significantly inhibited the 
footpad swelling and arthritic symptoms. BME was effective in inhibiting 
cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities in arthritic rats. Decreased 
neutrophil infiltration was evident from decreased myeloperoxidase activity and 
histopathological data where an improvement in joint architecture was also 
observed. Serum anti-collagen IgM and IgG levels were consistently decreased. 
Thus the study demonstrates the potential antiarthritic effect of Bacopa 
monniera for treating arthritis which might confer its antirheumatic activity.
