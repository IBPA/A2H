AIM OF STUDY: In this study, we have investigated the analgesic and 
anti-arthritic effects of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combination of 
Lingzhi and San Miao San (SMS) in a rat model of arthritis induced by Freund's 
complete adjuvant (FCA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with monoarthritis by 
single unilateral injection of FCA into the knee joint. The TCM combination was 
administered to the rats daily by intraperitoneal injection (50mg/(kgday)) or 
via oral administration (500mg/(kgday)) for 7 days before induction of arthritis 
and 7 days after. Extension angle that provoked struggling behavior, and size 
and blood flow of the rat knees were measured to give indexes of allodynia, 
edema, and hyperemia, respectively. The extent of cell infiltration, tissue 
proliferation, and erosions of joint cartilage provided additional indexes of 
the arthritis condition.
RESULTS: FCA injection produced significant allodynia, edema, hyperemia, immune 
cell infiltration, synovial tissue proliferation, and erosions of joint 
cartilage in the ipsilateral knees compared with the contralateral 
saline-injected knees. Intraperitoneal injection of the TCM combination 
(50mg/(kgday)) suppressed allodynia, edema, and hyperemia in the inflamed knees, 
and oral administration (500mg/(kgday)) suppressed edema and hyperemia. 
Histological examination showed that the TCM administered by either route 
reduced immune cell infiltration and erosion of joint cartilage.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the Lingzhi and SMS formulation has 
analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in arthritic rat knees, and concur to 
previous clinical studies that showed the TCM combination reduced pain in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients, and extends its possible benefit to suppression 
of inflammatory symptoms in these patients.
