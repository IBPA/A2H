The endogenously activated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (RSFs) 
are likely to be the key to curing the disease. RSFs express Toll‑like receptors 
(TLRs) rendering them prone to activation by exogenous and endogenous TLR 
ligands, resulting in the production of chemokines and cytokines Germline 
deletion of tumor necrosis factor‑α‑induced protein‑8 like 2 (TIPE2, also known 
as TNFAIP8L2) results in fatal inflammation and hypersensitivity to TLR and 
T cell receptor stimulation. The present study demonstrates an inverse 
association between TIPE2 and cytokine gene expression in RSFs following 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Enhanced TIPE2 expression decreased 
Ras‑related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac) activation and interferon 
regulatory factor 3 phosphorylation, and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase and Rac 
inhibition significantly diminished LPS‑induced cytokine gene expression in 
RSFs. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that TIPE2 
serves a negative role in activating the Rac signaling pathway and in the 
initiation of the immune response by decreasing the activity of proinflammatory 
cytokines. These results may be useful in designing novel strategies for the 
prevention and treatment of RA.
