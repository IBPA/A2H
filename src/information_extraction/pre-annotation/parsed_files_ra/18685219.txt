We evaluated the effects of a casein hydrolysate (CH) prepared from Aspergillus 
oryzae protease on rat adjuvant arthritis, a model of human rheumatoid 
arthritis. CH was administered orally once a day to the animals for 22 d after 
the adjuvant injection. CH suppressed swelling in the adjuvant-uninjected hind 
paws, and a higher dose of CH suppressed the increase in arthritic score and 
swelling of the adjuvant-injected hind paws. A histopathological examination 
revealed evidence that the higher dose of CH suppressed the articular changes in 
the rats. In addition, CH suppressed the production of nitric oxide and 
prostaglandin E(2) in the plasma of the rats. These results suggest that CH had 
a suppressive effect on adjuvant arthritis by inhibiting the acute and chronic 
inflammatory reactions.
