Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease and its exact cause 
and pathophysiological process remain unclear. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes, 
macrophages and T lymphocytes are considered to be the major contributors in the 
pathophysiological process of RA; however, an increasing number of papers have 
drawn attention to the potential role of mast cells (MCs) in the process. In an 
animal model of RA, we reported an increase in MC numbers in the arthritic 
region, which agreed with the observation in human RA. In addition, a good 
correlation between the number of MCs and the development of disease was 
observed. However, there has been little experimental or clinical evidence of 
the beneficial effects of the modification of MC activity on the pathogenesis of 
RA and this is the weak point of the hypothesis. We therefore studied the 
effects of a MC-stabilizing compound, cromoglicate lisetil (CL), which is an 
orally deliverable prodrug of cromolyn sodium, on the RA disease model. The 
MC-stabilizer had efficacy in a mouse model. The beneficial effects of CL in 
this animal model further suggested the contribution of MCs in the 
pathophysiological process of RA. Concerning the contributive mechanism of MC on 
the pathogenesis of RA, our results using a disease model suggested that 
activation of MC chymase and matrix metalloproteinases might be involved. MC is 
now considered to be one of the targets of RA treatment.
