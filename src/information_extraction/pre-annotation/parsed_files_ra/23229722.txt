BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is to be 
further elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the role of oral 
antigen in the induction of RA-like inflammation in the articular joints of 
rats.
METHODS: An RA animal model was developed by gavage-feeding with antigen and 
aspirin, and lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneal injection. The gut epithelial 
barrier function was assessed by the absorption of mannitol and lactose. The 
absorption of the specific antigen was observed by the immune fluorescent 
method. The frequency of antigen specific CD4+ T cells in the peripheral system 
was assessed by flow cytometry. The inflammation in the ankle joints was 
evaluated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Rats treated with aspirin showed intestinal barrier dysfunction; high 
contents of the specific antigen were absorbed into the lamina propria. The 
antigen specific CD4+ T cells were detected in the spleen that could be 
activated by exposure to the specific antigen as well as the extracts of joint 
tissue. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected in the sera. 
Antigen specific immune complexes were localized in the ankle joints. Heavy 
extravasation was observed in the synovial cavity. The histology showed an 
inflammatory feature in the ankle joints.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral antigen can induce RA-like inflammation in the articular 
joints under certain environment such as gut epithelial barrier dysfunction.
