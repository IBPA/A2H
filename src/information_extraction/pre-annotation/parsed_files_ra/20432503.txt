Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyses the release of arachidonic acid for generation 
of lipid mediators of inflammation and is crucial in diverse inflammatory 
processes. The functions of the secretory PLA2 enzymes (sPLA2), numbering nine 
members in humans, are poorly understood, though they have been shown to 
participate in lipid mediator generation and the associated inflammation. To 
further understand the roles of sPLA2 in disease, we quantified the expression 
of these enzymes in the synovial fluid in rheumatoid arthritis and used 
gene-deleted mice to examine their contribution in a mouse model of autoimmune 
erosive inflammatory arthritis. Contrary to expectation, we find that the group 
V sPLA2 isoform plays a novel anti-inflammatory role that opposes the 
pro-inflammatory activity of group IIA sPLA2. Mechanistically, group V sPLA2 
counter-regulation includes promotion of immune complex clearance by regulating 
cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis. These observations identify a novel 
anti-inflammatory function for a PLA2 and identify group V sPLA2 as a potential 
biotherapeutic for treatment of immune-complex-mediated inflammation.
