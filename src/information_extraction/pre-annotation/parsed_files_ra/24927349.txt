BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Sidh Makardhwaj (SM) is a mercury based Ayurvedic 
formulation used in rheumatoid arthritis and neurological disorders. However, 
toxicity concerns due to mercury content are often raised. Therefore, the 
present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of SM on brain cerebrum, 
liver and kidney in rats.
METHODS: Graded doses of SM (10, 50, 100 mg/kg), mercuric chloride (1 mg/kg) and 
normal saline were administered orally to male Wistar rats for 28 days. 
Behavioural parameters were assessed on days 1, 7, 14 and 28 using Morris water 
maze, passive avoidance, elevated plus maze and rota rod. Liver and kidney 
function tests were done on day 28. Animals were sacrificed and brain cerebrum 
acetylcholinesterase activity, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced 
glutathione (GSH) in brain cerebrum, liver, kidney were estimated. The levels of 
mercury in brain cerebrum, liver and kidney were estimated and histopathology of 
these tissues was also performed.
RESULTS: SM in the doses used did not cause significant change in 
neurobehavioural parameters, brain cerebrum AChE activity, liver (ALT, AST, ALP 
bilirubin) and kidney (serum urea and creatinine) function tests as compared to 
control. The levels of mercury in brain cerebrum, liver, and kidney were found 
to be raised in dose dependent manner. However, the levels of MDA and GSH in 
these tissues did not show significant changes at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg. 
Also, there was no histopathological change in cytoarchitecture of brain 
cerebrum, liver, and kidney tissues at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that 
Sidh Makardhwaj upto five times the equivalent human dose administered for 28 
days did not show any toxicological effects on rat brain cerebrum, liver and 
kidney.
