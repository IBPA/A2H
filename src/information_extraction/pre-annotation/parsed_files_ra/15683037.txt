Toxocara canis and T. cati are not only ubiquitously distributed parasites of 
dogs, foxes and cats, but may also infest humans, causing a great variety of 
symptoms and sometimes also severe diseases: the visceral larva migrans 
syndrome, the ocular larva migrans syndrome, covert toxocarosis, common 
toxocarosis, neurological toxocarosis, and some other clinical pictures (asthma 
bronchiale, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis) are considered to be induced by 
Toxocara species. Both Toxocara species are also widely distributed in Austrian 
dog, fox and cat populations; seroepidemiological studies carried out in Austria 
revealed seroprevalence rates of 3.7% among the normal human population and up 
to 44% among persons particularly exposed to those parasites (i.e. 
veterinarians, farmers). Although many Toxocara infestations do not cause severe 
clinical manifestations, a few dozens of toxocarosis patients have been 
registered every year during the last years; in reality, however, we have to 
assume that several hundreds of patients suffer from toxocarosis. This paper 
tries to give a synoptic overview of the nosology of this (still) largely almost 
unknown helminthozoonosis, moreover it summarizes the most important 
epidemiologic parameters, and presents the diagnostic and therapeutic 
possibilities available today.
