The pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory joint diseases such as adult and 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and Lyme arthritis is still poorly understood. 
Central to the various hypotheses in this respect is the notable involvement of 
T and B cells. Here we develop the premise that the nominal antigen-independent, 
polyclonal activation of preactivated T cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 has 
a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of pathogen-induced chronic 
inflammatory joint disease. We support this with the following evidence. Both 
naive and effector T cells express TLR-2. A prototypic lipoprotein, Lip-OspA, 
from the etiological agent of Lyme disease, namely Borrelia burgdorferi, but not 
its delipidated form or lipopolysaccharide, was able to provide direct 
antigen-nonspecific co-stimulatory signals to both antigen-sensitized naive T 
cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines via TLR-2. Lip-OspA induced the 
proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion of purified, 
anti-CD3-sensitized, naive T cells from C57BL/6 mice but not from 
TLR-2-deficient mice. Induction of proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion of CTL 
lines by Lip-OspA was independent of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement but was 
considerably enhanced after suboptimal TCR activation and was inhibitable by 
monoclonal antibodies against TLR-2.
