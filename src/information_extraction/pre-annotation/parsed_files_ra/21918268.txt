Rituximab is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody against the CD 20 
antigen on the surface of B lymphocytes. It binds to CD20 and causes B cell 
death by antibody dependant cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement mediated 
cytotoxicity and apoptosis. It leads to rapid and sustained depletion of B 
cells. It is licensed for use in adults with CD20 positive B-cell lymphoma and 
rheumatoid arthritis. In children, it has been used in a variety of off-label 
indications with promising results. It has proved useful as salvage therapy in 
relapsed refractory non-Hodgkins lymphoma and leukemia, and in hematological 
conditions including chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia with 
inhibitors, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. It has also proved effective in 
autoimmune conditions like primary systemic vasculitis and systemic lupus 
erythematosis. Nephrotic syndrome and opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome are among 
the emerging indications for rituximab. In solid organ transplantation, 
rituximab is useful in the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic 
rejection as well as in post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease. 
Toxicity includes acute infusion reactions, susceptibility to bacterial 
infections, and reactivation of viral infections.
