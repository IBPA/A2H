Infliximab, a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody, blocks the action of 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha and is a highly effective treatment for several 
inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid 
arthritis. Although safety data are encouraging, immunosuppressive sequelae may 
result. We report the acute development of multiple squamous cell carcinomas and 
keratoacanthomas in a patient receiving infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis.
