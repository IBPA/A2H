OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type 
(Cas-L), a downstream signaling molecule of beta1 integrins, in the 
pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: We analyzed human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) tax transgenic 
mice as well as samples from human RA patients. Splenocytes from tax transgenic 
mice were cultured on mouse endothelial cell-covered Transwell inserts, and 
cells migrating through the endothelial monolayer were counted. Biochemical 
studies were performed to analyze the protein expression and tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Cas-L. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect 
Cas-L-positive cells that had infiltrated into the joints.
RESULTS: Migratory activity of splenocytes from tax transgenic mice with 
arthritis (ATg) was much higher than that of tax transgenic mice without 
arthritis (NTg) and littermate control mice. The expression of Cas-L protein and 
its tyrosine phosphorylation were increased in ATg mice compared with NTg and 
control mice, and this was accompanied by enhanced autophosphorylation of Fyn 
and Lck. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a large number of 
Cas-L-positive lymphocytes migrating into the affected joints. Furthermore, in 
human RA, Cas-L-positive lymphocytes were shown to infiltrate to the 
inflammatory lesions.
CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that Cas-L plays an important role in 
the pathophysiology of RA.
