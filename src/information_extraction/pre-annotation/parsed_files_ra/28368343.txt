The seeds of Strychnosnux-vomica L., as a traditional Chinese medicine, have 
good anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. However, it usually leads to 
gastrointestinal irritation and systemic toxicity via oral administration. In 
the study, it was discovered that a novel gel transdermal delivery system 
contained brucine, the main effective component extracted from 
Strychnosnux-vomica. Results showed that the brucine gel system inhibited 
arthritis symptoms and the proliferation of the synoviocytes in the rat adjuvant 
arthritis model, which indicated its curative effect for rheumatoid arthritis. 
Meanwhile, it significantly relieved the xylene-induced ear edema in the mouse 
ear swelling test, which manifested its anti-inflammatory property. Moreover, 
the brucine gel eased the pain of paw formalin injection in the formalin test, 
which demonstrated its analgesic effects. In addition, the brucine significantly 
inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production 
without affecting the viability of cell in vitro anti-inflammatory test, which 
proved that its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions were related to 
inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. It is suggested that the brucine gel is a 
promising vehicle for transdermal delivery on the treatment of inflammatory 
disease.
