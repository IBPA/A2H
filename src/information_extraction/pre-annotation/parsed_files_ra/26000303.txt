We assessed the effect of a novel and selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) 
inhibitor, ciclamilast, on chronic inflammation in adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(AIA), a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and acute inflammation in the 
rat and mouse model of carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis. Our 
results showed that daily oral administration of ciclamilast at 1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited the increase in hind paw volume of rats with 
AIA. The inhibition of paw edema was associated with inhibition of both the 
production of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and cell infiltration 
assessed in subcutaneous paw tissue. Moreover, there was significantly less 
tissue destruction in the ciclamilast-treated rats compared to the 
vehicle-treated rats, as assessed by radiographic analysis and histopathological 
evaluation. In the two acute inflammation models, ciclamilast inhibited 
carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and inflammatory cell migration into the 
peritoneal cavity in mice in a dose-dependent manner. These results not only 
suggest that ciclamilast, as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), can 
attenuate RA but also provide proof of principle that a PDE4 inhibitor may be 
useful for the treatment of arthritis.
