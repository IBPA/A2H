Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an animal model for rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to accelerate CIA; however, the 
pathogenetic mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, type II 
collagen (CII)-immunized mice were found to have marked increases in degree of 
expression of mRNA of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in 
their arthritic paws and of serum anti-CII antibody concentration before the 
onset of arthritis induced by LPS injection. The gene expression was rapid and 
continuous after direct activation of nuclear factor κB. The amounts of mRNA of 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-2, as well as of matrix metalloproteinases and the 
receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand, increased with the development 
of arthritis, correlated positively with clinical severity and corresponded with 
histopathological changes. Moreover, anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody inhibited 
the development of LPS-accelerated CIA and a single injection of recombinant 
mouse TNF-α induced increases in anti-CII antibody concentrations, suggesting 
TNF-α may contribute to the development of arthritis by both initiation of 
inflammation and production of autoantibodies. These data suggest that 
exacerbation of RA by LPS is associated with rapid and continuous production of 
inflammatory mediators and autoantibodies.
