Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase 
involved in B-cell and myeloid cell activation, downstream of B-cell and FcÎ³ 
receptors, respectively. Preclinical studies have indicated that inhibition of 
Btk activity might offer a potential therapy in autoimmune diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Here we disclose the 
discovery and preclinical characterization of a potent, selective, and 
noncovalent Btk inhibitor currently in clinical development. GDC-0853 (29) 
suppresses B cell- and myeloid cell-mediated components of disease and 
demonstrates dose-dependent activity in an in vivo rat model of inflammatory 
arthritis. It demonstrates highly favorable safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles in preclinical and Phase 2 studies ongoing in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and chronic spontaneous urticaria. On 
the basis of its potency, selectivity, long target residence time, and 
noncovalent mode of inhibition, 29 has the potential to be a best-in-class Btk 
inhibitor for a wide range of immunological indications.
