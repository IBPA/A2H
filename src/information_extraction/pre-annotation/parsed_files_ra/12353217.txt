Although central nervous symptoms such as hyperalgesia, fatigue, malaise, and 
anorexia constitute major problems in the treatment of patients suffering from 
chronic inflammatory disease, little has been known about the signaling 
mechanisms by which the brain is activated during such conditions. Here, in an 
animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, we show that microsomal prostaglandin 
E-synthase, the inducible terminal isomerase in the prostaglandin 
E(2)-synthesizing pathway, is expressed in endothelial cells along the 
blood-brain barrier and in the parenchyma of the paraventricular hypothalamic 
nucleus. The endothelial cells but not the paraventricular hypothalamic cells 
displayed a concomitant induction of cyclooxygenase-2 and expressed 
interleukin-1 type 1 receptors, which indicates that the induction is due to 
peripherally released cytokines. In contrast to cyclooxygenase-2, microsomal 
prostaglandin E synthase had very sparse constitutive expression, suggesting 
that it could be a target for developing drugs that will carry fewer side 
effects than the presently available cyclooxygenase inhibitors. These findings, 
thus, suggest that immune-to-brain communication during chronic inflammatory 
conditions involves prostaglandin E2-synthesis both along the blood-brain 
barrier and in the parenchyma of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and 
point to novel avenues for the treatment of the brain-elicited disease symptoms 
during these conditions.
