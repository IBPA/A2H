Histological analysis is a morphological technique and an effective method for 
understanding the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we describe the 
processes of paraffin samples, including fixation, decalcifying, embedding, 
sectioning, and staining (hematoxylin and eosin, tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase, and immunohistochemistry) for an RA model mouse.
