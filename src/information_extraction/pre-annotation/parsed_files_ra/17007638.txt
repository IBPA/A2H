Synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is characterised by an 
influx and retention of CD97-positive inflammatory cells. The ligands of CD97, 
CD55, chondroitin sulfate B, and alpha5beta1 (very late antigen [VLA]-5) are 
expressed abundantly in the synovial tissue predominantly on fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes, endothelium, and extracellular matrix. Based upon this expression 
pattern, we hypothesise CD97 expression to result in accumulation of 
inflammatory cells in the synovial tissue of RA patients. To determine the 
therapeutic effect of blocking CD97 in an animal model of RA, collagen-induced 
arthritis was induced in a total of 124 DBA/J1 mice. Treatment was started on 
day 21 (early disease) or on day 35 (longstanding disease) with the blocking 
hamster anti-mouse CD97 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1B2, control hamster 
immunoglobulin, or NaCl, applied intraperitoneally three times a week. The paws 
were evaluated for clinical signs of arthritis and, in addition, examined by 
radiological and histological analysis. Mice receiving 0.5 mg CD97 mAb starting 
from day 21 had significantly less arthritis activity and hind paw swelling. 
Furthermore, joint damage and inflammation were reduced and granulocyte 
infiltration was decreased. When treatment was started on day 35, CD97 mAb 
treatment had similar effects, albeit less pronounced. The results support the 
notion that CD97 contributes to synovial inflammation and joint destruction in 
arthritis.
