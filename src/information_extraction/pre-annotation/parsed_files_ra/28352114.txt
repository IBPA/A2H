BTK plays a critical role in the B cell receptor mediated inflammatory signaling 
in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Through a rational design approach we 
discovered a highly selective and potent BTK kinase inhibitor (CHMFL-BTK-11) 
which exerted its inhibitory efficacy through a covalent bond with BTK Cys481. 
CHMFL-BTK-11 potently blocked the anti-IgM stimulated BCR signaling in the Ramos 
cell lines and isolated human primary B cells. It significantly inhibited the 
LPS stimulated TNF-α production in the human PBMC cells but only weakly 
affecting the normal PBMC cell proliferation. In the adjuvant-induced arthritis 
rat model, CHMFL-BTK-11 ameliorated the inflammatory response through blockage 
of proliferation of activated B cells, inhibition of the secretion of the 
inflammatory factors such as IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IL-6 and PMΦ phagocytosis, 
stimulation of secretion of IL-10. The high specificity of CHMFL-BTK-11 makes it 
a useful pharmacological tool to further detect BTK mediated signaling in the 
pathology of RA.
