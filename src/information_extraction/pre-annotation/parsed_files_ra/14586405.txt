Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by progressive inflammation 
associated with abberrant proliferation of synoviocytes. In order to explore the 
characteristics of rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSF), we performed the 
comparative gene expression profile analysis between RSF and normal synovial 
fibroblasts (NSF) upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation. As an initial 
screening for the genes preferentially induced by TNF in RSF compared with NSF, 
we have adopted a cDNA array containing well-defined sets of genes responsible 
for cell growth, cell fate determination, and cellular invasiveness. 
Differentially expressed genes of interest were confirmed using real-time 
RT-PCR. We found that TNF induced the expression of Notch-1, Notch-4, and 
Jagged-2 in RSF. The expression of these proteins was detected in the RA 
synovial tissues. The nucleus of RA synoviocytes showed strong staining with 
anti-Notch-1 and Notch-4 antibody. TNF induced the nuclear translocation of 
Notch intracellular domain in RSF, indicating the elicitation of the Notch 
signaling. Notch-1, Notch-4, and Jagged-2 proteins were also detected in the 
developing synovium of mouse embryo. Thus, RSF may have re-acquired the 
primordial phenotype, accounting for the hyperproliferation and aggressive 
invasiveness, exhibiting tumor-like phenotype.
