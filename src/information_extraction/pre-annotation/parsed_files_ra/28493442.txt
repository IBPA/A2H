INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
periodontitis frequently cause bone destruction. Inflammation-induced bone loss 
results from the increase of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Recently, we 
demonstrated that urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) suppressed 
lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-inflammatory osteoclastogenesis through the adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, whereas its receptor 
(uPAR) promoted that through the Akt pathway.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of uPA-derived peptide (Å6) in the 
LPS-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction.
RESULTS: We found that Å6 attenuated inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone 
loss induced by LPS in mice. We also showed that Å6 attenuated the LPS-promoted 
inflammatory osteoclastogenesis by inactivation of NF-κB in RAW264.7 mouse 
monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Furthermore, we showed that Å6 attenuated the 
Akt phosphorylation, and promoted the AMPK phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: Å6 is involved in the suppression of LPS-promoted inflammatory 
osteoclastgensis and bone destruction by regulating the AMPK and Akt pathways. 
These findings provide a basis for clinical strategies to improve the bone loss 
caused by inflammatory diseases.
