OBJECTIVE: To identify the commonalities between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
diabetes mellitus (DM) to understand the mechanisms of Chinese medicine (CM) in 
different diseases with the same treatment.
METHODS: A text mining approach was adopted to analyze the commonalities between 
RA and DM according to CM and biological elements. The major commonalities were 
subsequently verified in RA and DM rat models, in which herbal formula for the 
treatment of both RA and DM identified via text mining was used as the 
intervention.
RESULTS: Similarities were identified between RA and DM regarding the CM 
approach used for diagnosis and treatment, as well as the networks of biological 
activities affected by each disease, including the involvement of adhesion 
molecules, oxidative stress, cytokines, T-lymphocytes, apoptosis, and 
inflammation. The Ramulus Cinnamomi-Radix Paeoniae Alba-Rhizoma Anemarrhenae is 
an herbal combination used to treat RA and DM. This formula demonstrated similar 
effects on oxidative stress and inflammation in rats with collagen-induced 
arthritis, which supports the text mining results regarding the commonalities 
between RA and DM.
CONCLUSION: Commonalities between the biological activities involved in RA and 
DM were identified through text mining, and both RA and DM might be responsive 
to the same intervention at a specific stage.
