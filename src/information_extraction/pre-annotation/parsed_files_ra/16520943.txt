The host factors that influence autoimmune arthritides such as rheumatoid 
arthritis have not been fully elucidated. We previously found that genetic 
inactivation of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) in the arthritis-prone DBA/1j 
mouse strain significantly increases the susceptibility of this strain to 
autoimmune arthritis induced by immunization with collagen type II (CII) and 
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Here, we show that following intradermal 
infection with Mycobacterium avium, a similar arthritis phenotype was detected 
in Ccr2-null mice in the DBA/1j, but not in the BALB/c background. The failure 
to develop arthritis in Ccr2-null BALB/c mice occurred in the face of high 
bacterial burdens and low interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production. By contrast, 
Ccr2-null DBA/1j mice had low bacterial burdens, produced normal amounts of 
IFNgamma, and had high titers of autoantibodies against CII. Thus, the Ccr2-null 
state in an arthritic-prone genetic background leads to increased arthritis 
susceptibility following infectious (M. avium) and noninfectious (CII/CFA) 
challenges. Because CCR2 serves as a negative regulator of murine arthritis, 
caution might need to be exercised while testing CCR2 blockers in human 
arthritis or other diseases. These findings also indicate that Ccr2-null DBA/1j 
mice might serve as a valuable model system to uncover the immunological 
determinants of arthritis and to test novel antiarthritic agents.
