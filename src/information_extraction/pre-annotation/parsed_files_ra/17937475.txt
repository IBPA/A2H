OBJECTIVE: Previous studies demonstrated suppression of rat ankle arthritis by 
local injection of kallistatin gene, a negative regulator of angiogenesis. We 
analyzed circulating levels, synovial concentrations, and tissue localizations 
of kallistatin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Paired plasma and joint fluid samples were simultaneously obtained from 
24 patients with RA and 14 with osteoarthritis (OA). Synovial tissues from 5 
patients with RA and 5 with OA were obtained during surgery. Fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLS) and mononuclear cells (MNC) were prepared. ELISA was used to 
measure kallistatin levels of plasma, joint fluid, cell lysate, and synovium 
homogenate extract. Synovial tissues were subjected to Western blot and 
immunohistochemical staining. In addition, the tissue kallikrein (TK) levels of 
plasma and joint fluid samples were also measured by the ELISA.
RESULTS: Circulating and synovial levels of kallistatin and TK were elevated in 
patients with RA. The immunohistochemical assay exhibited stainings of 
kallistatin on both infiltrating MNC and FLS. Intracellular kallistatin levels 
were significantly elevated in MNC and FLS from patients with RA.
CONCLUSION: Elevated kallistatin levels were demonstrated in patients with RA, 
particularly in synovial tissues, FLS, and MNC. This report is the first to 
demonstrate upregulation of kallistatin expression in rheumatoid joints.
