OBJECTIVES: Electrical stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), referred 
to here as ganglionic field stimulation (GFS), is effective in reducing clinical 
pain, probably by interrupting transmission of afferent impulse trains on 
sensory neurons as they pass through the DRG. We therefore tested whether 
efferent impulse trains conveyed by sensory neurons, which contribute to 
neurogenic inflammation, may also be interrupted by GFS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis, a model of clinical 
rheumatoid arthritis, was initiated in rats concurrently with the insertion of 
an electrode for GFS at the fourth lumbar DRG. Continuous GFS (20 Hz pulse rate, 
current at 80% of the motor threshold) was initiated 6 days later and continued 
for 14 days. Plantar pain sensitivity, ankle arthritis score, and dimensions of 
the foot and ankle were determined one hour after termination of GFS.
RESULTS: The foot/ankle contralateral to GFS developed hypersensitivity to 
threshold and noxious mechanical stimulation, swelling, and high arthritis 
score, all of which were normalized in the foot/ankle ipsilateral with GFS. 
Histology showed GFS limited joint destruction. Electrophysiological recording 
showed GFS can block efferent impulse trains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that GFS can reduce neurogenic inflammation and 
the resulting joint damage in a model of rheumatoid arthritis, probably by 
blocking the transit of impulse trains through the DRG. GFS may have clinical 
utility in limiting joint destruction in inflammatory arthritis such as 
rheumatoid arthritis.
