Emerging evidence suggests that mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma 
translocation 1 (MALT1) is a key regulator of inflammatory diseases; however, 
the pathological role of MALT1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not well 
understood. Consequently, this protein has not been therapeutically targeted for 
the treatment of RA. MALT1 plays a role in the paracaspase pathway, has 
proteolytic activity and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory 
responses. In this study, we found that the MALT1-targeting inhibitory small 
molecule, MALT1 selective inhibitor 
2-chloro-N-[4-[5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenylacetamide 
(MI-2) strongly suppresses the differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts in 
the absence or presence of the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor α. 
Furthermore, MI-2 ameliorates pathologic bone erosion and synovitis in an in 
vivo mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Mechanistically, MI-2 blocked 
expression of the master osteoclast regulator - nuclear factor of activated T 
cells 1 (NFATc1) - by inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which is a critical 
regulator of NFATc1. These findings highlight the important regulatory role of 
MALT1 in the NF-κB-NFATc1-signalling axis during osteoclastogenesis and suggest 
that targeting MALT1 is a promising treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis.
