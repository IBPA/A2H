Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases with a global 
prevalence. Despite significant research into this disease, no drugs with 
acceptable safety profiles are yet available for its treatment. We investigated 
the possible anti-arthritic effects of the 4-methylhistamine (4-MeH) histamine 4 
receptor (H4R) agonist and the JNJ77777120 (JNJ) H4R antagonist to explore the 
role of H4R in a mouse model of collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). 
Arthritis was induced via intravenous (tail vein) injection of Balb/c mice with 
a 5-clone cocktail of mAbs against collagen type II, followed by LPS, and the 
effects of treatment with 4-MeH or JNJ (30 mg kg(-1), i.p, twice daily) for 7 
days (prophylactic or therapeutic regimens) were assessed. The results revealed 
increased paw edema, arthritic scores, joint histological inflammatory damage 
and matrix metalloproteinase-3 levels and high levels of Th1 pro-inflammatory 
cytokine mRNA and serum proteins in CAIA mice or following H4R activation via 
4-MeH. Additionally, 4-MeH efficiently increased expression levels of NF-κB p65. 
JNJ-treated mice showed a substantial reduction in all the previously mentioned 
effects, with a similar trend being observed under prophylactic and therapeutic 
treatment regimens. The results of the present work indicate that JNJ exhibits 
significant anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities, demonstrating the 
clear involvement of H4R antagonism in the pathogenesis and progression of RA.
