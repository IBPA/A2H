The cytoplasmic phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 
(PTPN22), is a negative regulator of T cell signaling. Genome-wide association 
studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PTPN22 confer an 
increased risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases in humans. The precise 
function of PTPN22 and how the variant protein contributes to autoimmunity is 
not well understood. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of PTPN22 
deficiency on disease susceptibility in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis. 
The SKG mouse expresses a hypomorphic mutant allele of ZAP70, which, upon 
exposure to fungal Ags, predisposes the mice to a CD4(+) T cell-mediated 
autoimmune arthritis that closely resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans. 
Surprisingly, SKG Ptpn22(-/-) mice developed less severe mannan-induced 
arthritis compared with SKG mice. Diminution of disease was not due to 
significant alterations in thymocyte development or repertoire selection in SKG 
Ptpn22(-/-) mice, even though T cell-mediated signal transduction was improved. 
Instead, Ptpn22 deficiency appeared to bias CD4 Th cell differentiation away 
from the Th17 lineage, which is pathogenic in this setting, to a more Th1/T 
regulatory-focused response. These data show that even small perturbations in 
TCR signal transduction pathways can have profound consequences on the 
differentiation of T cell lineages and thus for the development of autoimmune 
diseases.
