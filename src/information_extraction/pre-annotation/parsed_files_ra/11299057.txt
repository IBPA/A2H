The origin and role of IL-17, a T-cell derived cytokine, in cartilage and bone 
destruction during rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain to be clarified. In human ex 
vivo models, addition of IL-17 enhanced IL-6 production and collagen 
destruction, and inhibited collagen synthesis by RA synovium explants. On mouse 
cartilage, IL-17 enhanced cartilage proteoglycan loss and inhibited its 
synthesis. On human RA bone explants, IL-17 also increased bone resorption and 
decreased formation. Addition of IL-1 in these conditions increased the effect 
of IL-17. Blocking of bone-derived endogenous IL-17 with specific inhibitors 
resulted in a protective inhibition of bone destruction. Conversely, 
intra-articular administration of IL-17 into a normal mouse joint induced 
cartilage degradation. In conclusion, the contribution of IL-17 derived from 
synovium and bone marrow T cells to joint destruction suggests the control of 
IL-17 for the treatment of RA.
