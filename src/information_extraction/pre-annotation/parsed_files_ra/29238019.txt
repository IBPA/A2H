  Osteoclasts are differentiated from precursors of the monocyte/macrophage 
lineage originated from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and are the sole 
bone-resorbing cells in the body. Osteoclast differentiation is thought to 
require M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and RANKL (receptor 
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) signaling. However, it has recently 
been proposed that under chronic inflammatory conditions, such as systemic 
autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), an increase in inflammatory 
cytokine levels within joints induces pathological osteoclast differentiation, 
causing excessive bone resorption. In addition, the authors have reported that 
stimulating mouse bone marrow monocytes and human CD14+ monocytes with 
combination of TNFα and IL-6 can induce differentiation of osteoclast-like 
cells, which are cells with bone resorption activity. In the present article, we 
discuss the mechanism of osteoclast differentiation of RANKL-independent 
bone-resorbing cells, using both data from the aforementioned report as well as 
the latest findings. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RANKL-independent, 
cytokine-mediated osteoclast differentiation could facilitate the development of 
novel therapies for inflammatory joint diseases.
