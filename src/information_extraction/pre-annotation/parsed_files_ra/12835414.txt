Prostaglandin (PG)E2 is a potent mediator of pain and inflammation, and high 
levels of this lipid mediator are observed in numerous disease states. The 
inhibition of PGE2 production to control pain and to treat diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis to date has depended on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory 
agents such as aspirin. However, these agents inhibit the synthesis of all 
prostanoids. To produce biologically active PGE2, PGE synthases catalyze the 
isomerization of PGH2 into PGE2. Recently, several PGE synthases have been 
identified and cloned, but their role in inflammation is not clear. To study the 
physiological role of the individual PGE synthases, we have generated by 
targeted homologous recombination a mouse line deficient in microsomal PGE 
synthase 1 (mPGES1) on the inbred DBA/1lacJ background. mPGES1-deficient 
(mPGES1-/-) mice are viable and fertile and develop normally compared with 
wild-type controls. However, mPGES1-/- mice displayed a marked reduction in 
inflammatory responses compared with mPGES1+/+ mice in multiple assays. Here, we 
identify mPGES1 as the PGE synthase that contributes to the pathogenesis of 
collagen-induced arthritis, a disease model of human rheumatoid arthritis. We 
also show that mPGES1 is responsible for the production of PGE2 that mediates 
acute pain during an inflammatory response. These findings suggest that mPGES1 
provides a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain associated 
with inflammatory states.
