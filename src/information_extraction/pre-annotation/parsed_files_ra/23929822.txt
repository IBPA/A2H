Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (Aif-1) is a 17 kDa EF hand motif-bearing 
protein expressed primarily in developing spermatids and cells of 
monocyte/macrophage lineage. Increased Aif-1 expression has been identified in 
clinically important conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
sclerosis, endometriosis, and transplant-associated arteriosclerosis. Largely 
similar gene products arising from the same locus are known as ionized Ca(2+) 
binding adapter-1 (Iba1), microglial response factor-1 (MRF1), and daintain; 
Iba1 in particular has emerged as a histologic marker of microglia and their 
activation in pathologic CNS conditions, including the response to facial nerve 
axotomy and stroke, uveitis, and experimental autoimmune neuritis and 
encephalomyelitis. Nevertheless, how aif-1 gene products affect cellular 
function is only partly understood, and the physiologic significance of these 
products for male fertility, immune system development, and inflammation has not 
been described. To permit such investigations, we generated a mouse line with 
targeted deletion of the coding regions of the aif-1 gene. Here we report that 
mice lacking Aif-1 breed well and show normal post-natal growth, but show 
resistance to disease in a model of collagen-induced arthritis. We anticipate 
that these mice will be useful for studies of Aif-1 function in a variety of 
immune and inflammatory disease models.
