Regulatory B cells control inflammation and autoimmunity in mice, including the 
recently identified IL-10-competent B10 cell subset that represents 1% to 3% of 
spleen B cells. In this study, a comparable IL-10-competent B10 cell subset was 
characterized in human blood. B10 cells were functionally identified by their 
ability to express cytoplasmic IL-10 after 5 hours of ex vivo stimulation, 
whereas progenitor B10 (B10pro) cells required 48 hours of in vitro stimulation 
before they acquired the ability to express IL-10. B10 and B10pro cells 
represented 0.6% and approximately 5% of blood B cells, respectively. Ex vivo 
B10 and B10pro cells were predominantly found within the CD24(hi)CD27(+) B-cell 
subpopulation that was able to negatively regulate monocyte cytokine production 
through IL-10-dependent pathways during in vitro functional assays. Blood B10 
cells were present in 91 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, primary Sj√∂gren syndrome, autoimmune vesiculobullous skin 
disease, or multiple sclerosis, and were expanded in some cases as occurs in 
mice with autoimmune disease. Mean B10 + B10pro-cell frequencies were also 
significantly higher in patients with autoimmune disease compared with healthy 
controls. The characterization of human B10 cells will facilitate their 
identification and the study of their regulatory activities during human 
disease.
