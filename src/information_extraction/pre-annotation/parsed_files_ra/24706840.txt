Porphyromonas gingivalis is the major causative agent of periodontitis, and it 
may also be involved in the development of systemic diseases (atherosclerosis, 
rheumatoid arthritis). P. gingivalis is found on and within oral and gingival 
epithelial cells following binding to surface components of host cells, which 
serve as receptors for the bacterium. Evidence is presented in this study that 
shows that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a critical role in the adherence of P. 
gingivalis to host cells. Studies of confocal microscopy indicate colocalization 
of P. gingivalis with TG2 on the surface of HEp-2 epithelial cells, with 
clusters of TG2 seen at bacterial attachment sites. By silencing the expression 
of TG2 with siRNA in HEp-2 cells, P. gingivalis association was greatly 
diminished. The bacterium does not bind well to a mouse fibroblast cell line 
that produces low amounts of surface TG2, but binding can be restored by 
introduction of TG2 expressed on a plasmid. TG2 can form very tight complexes 
with fibronectin (FN), and the complementary binding sites of the two proteins 
are known. A synthetic peptide that mimics the main FN-binding sequence of TG2 
blocks the formation of TG2-FN complexes and is highly effective in inhibiting 
adherence of P. gingivalis to host cells. These findings provide evidence of a 
role for cell-surface TG2 in bacterial attachment and subsequent 
internalization.
