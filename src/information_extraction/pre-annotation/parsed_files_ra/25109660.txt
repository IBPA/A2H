γ-Secretase inhibitors which prevent Notch activation are emerging as potent 
therapeutics for various inflammatory diseases, including ischemic stroke and 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, their indiscriminate distribution in the body 
causes serious side effects after systemic administration, since Notch proteins 
are ubiquitous receptors that play an important role in cellular functions such 
as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In this study, hyaluronan 
nanoparticles (HA-NPs) bearing a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) were prepared as 
potential therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis. In vivo biodistribution of the 
DAPT-loaded HA-NPs (DNPs), labeled with near-infrared dye, were observed using a 
non-invasive optical imaging system after systemic administration to a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. The results demonstrated that DNPs 
were effectively accumulated at the inflamed joint of the CIA mice. From the in 
vivo therapeutic efficacy tests, DNPs (1mg DAPT/kg) significantly attenuated the 
severity of RA induction compared to DAPT alone (2mg/kg), which was judged from 
clinical scores, tissue damage, and neutrophil infiltration. In addition, DNPs 
dramatically reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, 
MCP-1, and IL-6, -12, -17) and collagen-specific auto-antibodies (IgG1 and 
IgG2a) in the serum of the CIA mice. These results suggest that DNPs have 
potential as therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis.
