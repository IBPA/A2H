Mechanistic insight into how adaptive immune responses are modified along the 
self-nonself continuum may offer more effective opportunities to treat 
autoimmune disease, cancer, and other sterile inflammatory disorders. Recent 
genetic studies in the KRN mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis demonstrate that 
the immunomodulatory molecule IDO2 modifies responses to self-antigens; however, 
the mechanisms involved are obscure. In this study, we show that IDO2 exerts a 
critical function in B cells to support the generation of autoimmunity. In 
experiments with IDO2-deficient mice, adoptive transplant experiments 
demonstrated that IDO2 expression in B cells was both necessary and sufficient 
to support robust arthritis development. IDO2 function in B cells was contingent 
on a cognate, Ag-specific interaction to exert its immunomodulatory effects on 
arthritis development. We confirmed a similar requirement in an established 
model of contact hypersensitivity, in which IDO2-expressing B cells are required 
for a robust inflammatory response. Mechanistic investigations showed that 
IDO2-deficient B cells lacked the ability to upregulate the costimulatory marker 
CD40, suggesting IDO2 acts at the T-B cell interface to modulate the potency of 
T cell help needed to promote autoantibody production. Overall, our findings 
revealed that IDO2 expression by B cells modulates autoimmune responses by 
supporting the cross talk between autoreactive T and B cells.
