Sj16, a 16-kDa protein produced by Schistosoma japonicum, has been demonstrated 
to have anti-inflammatory effect. However, the possible mechanism of these 
phenomena has not been discovered. Here, we tried to touch it with arthritis 
rats' model induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). A set of 
pathogenic characters were observed in CFA-treated rat, including local and 
systematic read-out, which showed the model successfully set up. After 
administration of rSj16 (recombinant Sj16) in vivo, paw swelling reduced 
significantly and in a dose-dependent manner, the level of TNF-α, IL-1β and NO 
decreased and IL-10 in the serum increased. In vitro, rSj16 reversed the 
augmented surface expression of CD80, CD86, CD54 and OX6 induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), whereas endocytotic 
capacity of rSj16-treated dendritic cell (DC) was profoundly increased. IL-12p70 
released from rSj16-treated BMDC was decreased but IL-10 increased. Further, 
following incubation with rSj16 primed BMDCs, the sensitized T cells exhibited 
increased production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 and decreased 
production of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ. Collectively, these results implied that rSj16 
alleviated CFA-induced arthritis, and the possible mechanisms may be its 
interruption of maturation and function of DCs. rSj16 could be a potential 
therapeutic agent against rheumatoid arthritis.
