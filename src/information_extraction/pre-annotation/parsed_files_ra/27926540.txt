PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update on the new interleukin-1 
(IL-1) cytokine family members in inflammatory diseases with focus on recent 
findings concerning the family members IL-36, IL-37, and IL-38 and their 
different expression patterns.
RECENT FINDINGS: The IL-1 cytokines are known to be involved in many different 
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The latest IL-1 family members, IL-36, 
IL-37, and IL-38 have been shown to be differently regulated during course of 
disease. Studies of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases revealed that 
those cytokines are upregulated in the serum as well as in inflamed tissue. 
Both, epithelial cells and infiltrating peripheral mononuclear blood cells serve 
as source of the cytokines IL-36, IL-37, and IL-38 triggering different 
outcomes. These results could be confirmed in different mouse models and 
in-vitro and ex-vivo studies.
SUMMARY: IL-36, IL-37, and IL-38 are involved in the pathogenesis of the 
inflammatory diseases psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus 
erythematosus as well as Crohn's disease. Thereby IL-36 acts proinflammatory 
triggering further inflammatory mediators. In contrast, IL-37 and IL-38 are 
upregulated to counteract. Understanding the imbalance of the IL-1 family is 
crucial for future therapeutics.
