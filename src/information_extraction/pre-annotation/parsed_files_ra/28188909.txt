Infliximab is therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) against TNF-α employed in 
the treatment of immunoinflammatory diseases. The development of biosimilar mAbs 
is a global strategy to increase drug accessibility and reduce 
therapy-associated costs. Herein we compared key physicochemical characteristics 
and biological activities produced by infliximab and infliximab-Probiomed in 
order to identify functionally relevant differences between the mAbs. Binding of 
infliximab-Probiomed to TNF-α was specific and had kinetics comparable to that 
of the reference product. Both mAbs had highly similar neutralizing efficacy in 
HUVEC cell cultures stimulated with TNF-α. In vitro induction of CDC and ADCC 
were also similar between the evaluated products. In vivo comparability was 
assessed using a transgenic mouse model of arthritis that expresses human TNF-α 
in a 13-week multiple-administration study. Infliximab and infliximab-Probiomed 
showed comparable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Our results 
indicate that infliximab-Probiomed has highly similar activities to infliximab 
in preclinical models, warranting a clinical evaluation of its biosimilarity.
