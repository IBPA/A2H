We collected the data on the Sendeng-4 chemical composition corresponding 
targets through the literature and from DrugBank, SuperTarget, TTD (Therapeutic 
Targets Database) and other databases and the relevant signaling pathways from 
the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database and established 
models of the chemical composition-target network and chemical 
composition-target-disease network using Cytoscape software, the analysis 
indicated that the chemical composition had at least nine different types of 
targets that acted together to exert effects on the diseases, suggesting a 
"multi-component, multi-target" feature of the traditional Mongolian medicine. 
We also employed the rat model of rheumatoid arthritis induced by Collgen Type 
II to validate the key targets of the chemical components of Sendeng-4, and 
three of the key targets were validated through laboratory experiments, further 
confirming the anti-inflammatory effects of Sendeng-4. In all, this study 
predicted the active ingredients and targets of Sendeng-4, and explored its 
mechanism of action, which provided new strategies and methods for further 
research and development of Sendeng-4 and other traditional Mongolian medicines 
as well.
