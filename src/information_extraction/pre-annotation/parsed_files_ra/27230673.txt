There are limitations in the current classification of danger-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMP) receptors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 
new paradigm by using endogenous metabolites lysophospholipids (LPLs) as a 
prototype. By utilizing a data mining method we pioneered, we made the following 
findings: (1) endogenous metabolites such as LPLs at basal level have 
physiological functions; (2) under sterile inflammation, expression of some LPLs 
is elevated. These LPLs act as conditional DAMPs or anti-inflammatory 
homeostasis-associated molecular pattern molecules (HAMPs) for regulating the 
progression of inflammation or inhibition of inflammation, respectively; (3) 
receptors for conditional DAMPs and HAMPs are differentially expressed in human 
and mouse tissues; and (4) complex signaling mechanism exists between 
pro-inflammatory mediators and classical DAMPs that regulate the expression of 
conditional DAMPs and HAMPs. This novel insight will facilitate identification 
of novel conditional DAMPs and HAMPs, thus promote development of new 
therapeutic targets to treat inflammatory disorders.
