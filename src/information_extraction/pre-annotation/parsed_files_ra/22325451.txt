OBJECTIVES: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which degrades Heme to free iron, biliverdin 
and carbon monoxide (CO) plays an important role in inflammation. There are, 
however, conflicting data concerning the role of HO-1 in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and the therapeutic potential of individual heme degradation products 
remains to be determined. We therefore investigated the effect of CO and 
biliverdin upon therapeutic administration in the murine collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA) model of RA.
METHODS: CIA was induced in DBA/1 mice. Anti-CII antibody levels were determined 
by ELISA. Mice were scored for paw swelling and grip strength. After the first 
clinical signs of arthritis one group of animals was treated with biliverdin, 
the second group was treated with CO. After 60 days all animals were sacrificed 
and analysed for histomorphological signs of arthritis.
RESULTS: All animals immunised with CII developed serum anti-CII antibodies. 
Antibody levels were decreased in the CO-treated group. Both, Biliverdin and the 
CO-treated animals, showed an improvement in clinical disease activity. 
Histological analysis revealed significantly less inflammation, erosion and 
reduced numbers of osteoclasts in CO-treated animals only, whereas cartilage 
degradation was prevented in both biliverdin and CO-treated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a beneficial effect of CO, in particular, and 
biliverdin, on inflammation and bone destruction in the CIA mouse model.
