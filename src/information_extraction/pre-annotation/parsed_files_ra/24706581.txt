Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic crippling disease, where protein-based tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors show significant relief, but with 
potentially fatal side effects. A need for a safe, oral, cost-effective small 
molecule or phyto-pharmaceutical is warranted. BV-9238 is an Ayurvedic 
poly-herbal formulation containing specialized standardized extracts of Withania 
somnifera, Boswellia serrata, Zingiber officinale and Curcuma longa. The 
anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of BV-9238 were evaluated for 
inhibition of TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) production, in 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated, RAW 264.7, mouse macrophage cell line. BV-9238 
reduced TNF-α and NO production, without any cytotoxic effects. Subsequently, 
the formulation was tested in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) and 
carrageenan-induced paw edema (CPE) rat animal models. AIA was induced in rats 
by injecting Freund's complete adjuvant intra-dermally in the paw, and BV-9238 
and controls were administered orally for 21 days. Arthritic scores in AIA study 
and inflamed paw volume in CPE study were significantly reduced upon treatment 
with BV-9238. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory and 
anti-arthritic effects of BV-9238 are due to its inhibition of TNF-α, and NO, 
and this formulation shows promise as an alternate therapy for inflammatory 
disorders where TNF-α and NO play important roles.
