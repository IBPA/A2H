Capsaicin-sensitive afferents have complex regulatory functions in the joints 
orchestrated via neuropeptides. This study aimed to determine their role in the 
collagen-antibody induced rheumatoid arthritis model. Capsaicin-sensitive nerves 
were defunctionalized by the capsaicin receptor agonist resiniferatoxin in 
C57Bl/6 mice. Arthritis was induced by the ArithroMab antibody cocktail and 
adjuvant. Arthritis was monitored by measuring body weight, joint edema by 
plethysmometry, arthritis severity by clinical scoring, mechanonociceptive 
threshold by plantar esthesiometry, thermonociceptive threshold by hot plate, 
cold tolerance by paw withdrawal latency from 0 °C water. Grasping ability was 
determined by the wire-grid grip test. Bone structure was evaluated by in vivo 
micro-CT and histology. Arthritic animals developed a modest joint edema, 
mechanical and cold hyperalgesia, weight loss, and a diminished grasping 
function, while thermal hyperalgesia is absent in the model. Desensitised mice 
displayed reduced arthritis severity, edema, and mechanical hyperalgesia, 
however, cold hyperalgesia was significantly greater in this group. Arthritic 
controls displayed a transient decrease of bone volume and an increased 
porosity, while bone density and trabecularity increased in desensitised mice. 
The activation of capsaicin-sensitive afferents increases joint inflammation and 
mechanical hyperalgesia, but decreases cold allodynia. It also affects 
inflammatory bone structural changes by promoting bone resorption.
