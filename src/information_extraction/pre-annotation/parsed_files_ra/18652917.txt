Madecassoside is the highest amount of triterpene constituent in Centella 
asiatica herbs, a frequently prescribed crude drug in southeastern Asian and 
China for wound healing and scar management. The present study aimed to 
investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of madecassoside 
on collagen II (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. Madecassoside (10, 20 and 
40mg/kg), orally administered from the day of the antigen challenge for twenty 
consecutive days, dose-dependently alleviated the severity of the disease based 
on the reduced clinical scores, and elevated the body weights of mice. 
Histopathological examination indicated that madecassoside alleviated 
infiltration of inflammatory cells and synovial hyperplasia as well as protected 
joint destruction. Moreover, madecassoside reduced the serum level of anti-CII 
IgG, suppressed the delayed type hypersensitivity against CII in ears, and 
moderately suppress CII-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes from popliteal 
lymph nodes in CIA mice. In vitro, madecassoside was ineffective in the 
activation of macrophages caused by lipopolysaccharide. It was concluded that 
madecassoside substantially prevented mouse CIA, and might be the major active 
constituent of C. asiatica herbs responsible for clinical uses for rheumatoid 
arthritis. The underlying mechanisms of action may be mainly through regulating 
the abnormal humoral and cellular immunity as well as protecting joint 
destruction.
