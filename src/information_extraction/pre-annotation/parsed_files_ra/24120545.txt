Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
many inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and 
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, inhibition of this enzyme is assumed to provide 
a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of these maladies. In this study we 
investigated the metabolism of the potent cPLA2α inhibitors 
1-[3-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)-2-oxopropyl]indole-5-carboxylic acid (1) and 
3-isobutanoyl-1-[3-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)-2-oxopropyl]indole-5-carboxylic acid (2). 
Incubation of 1 with a mixture of human recombinant CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
3A4 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase enzymes led to reduction of its keto 
group and to hydroxylation at the terminal phenoxy residue. To identify the 
enzymes responsible for the observed reactions, experiments with isoform 
inhibitors were performed. In rat liver S9 fractions the only metabolite found 
was the alcohol 3 formed by the reduction of the keto group of 1. This reaction 
here was mainly catalyzed by cytosolic short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases 
(cSDR) as shown by inhibition experiments with different carbonyl reductase 
inhibitors. Furthermore, the metabolic stability of 2 in mouse brains was 
studied after intracerebroventricular application of this compound into the 
right brain hemispheres of mice. HPLC/MS analyses revealed that 2 is also 
readily reduced in the brain to an inactive alcohol metabolite most likely by 
carbonyl reductases.
