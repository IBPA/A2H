Beside their well known role in allergy, mast cells (MCs) are capable to sense 
multiple signals and have therefore the potential to be involved in many immune 
responses. MCs are actively present in the target tissues of some autoimmune 
disorders, suggesting a possible function in the manifestation of such diseases. 
This idea is strengthened by the evidence that KIT-dependent MC-deficient mice 
are protected from disease in many mouse models of autoimmunity, including 
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune skin blistering 
diseases. Thus, the essential role of MCs in autoimmunity not only significantly 
extends the knowledge of MCs in the immune response but also provides novel 
therapeutic targets for the treatment of such diseases. However, recent studies 
using a new generation of KIT-independent MC-deficient strains could not confirm 
an essential participation of MCs in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is 
necessary to clarify the observed discrepancies and to elucidate the role of MCs 
in autoimmune diseases. Here, we review the impact of MCs on the development of 
autoimmune diseases with focus on the controversial effects of MC deficiency in 
different mouse models of autoimmune diseases. We also try to clarify 
contradictory findings in mouse studies to finally elucidate the role of MCs in 
autoimmunity.
