Murine gammadelta T cell subsets, defined by their Vgamma chain usage, have been 
shown in various disease models to have distinct functional roles. In this 
study, we examined the responses of the two main peripheral gammadelta T cell 
subsets, Vgamma1(+) and Vgamma4(+) cells, during collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA), a mouse model that shares many hallmarks with human rheumatoid arthritis. 
We found that whereas both subsets increased in number, only the Vgamma4(+) 
cells became activated. Surprisingly, these Vgamma4(+) cells appeared to be Ag 
selected, based on preferential Vgamma4/Vdelta4 pairing and very limited TCR 
junctions. Furthermore, in both the draining lymph node and the joints, the vast 
majority of the Vgamma4/Vdelta4(+) cells produced IL-17, a cytokine that appears 
to be key in the development of CIA. In fact, the number of IL-17-producing 
Vgamma4(+) gammadelta T cells in the draining lymph nodes was found to be 
equivalent to the number of CD4(+)alphabeta(+) Th-17 cells. When mice were 
depleted of Vgamma4(+) cells, clinical disease scores were significantly reduced 
and the incidence of disease was lowered. A decrease in total IgG and IgG2a 
anti-collagen Abs was also seen. These results suggest that Vgamma4/Vdelta4(+) 
gammadelta T cells exacerbate CIA through their production of IL-17.
