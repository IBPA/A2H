A cumulative effect of the susceptibility genes with polymorphic alleles may be 
responsible for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to 
clarify whether susceptibility to RA is under the control of common allelic loci 
between two different RA models induced by extrinsic and intrinsic factors, 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice and arthritis in MRL/Mp (MRL) 
mice associated with the Fas deficient mutant gene, Fas(lpr), respectively. CIA 
was examined in mice of parental DBA/1 and MRL, (MRL x DBA/1) F1 and (MRL x 
DBA/1) F2 progenies. In genome-wide screening of the severity in the F2 using 
microsatellite markers, significant linkage was observed on chromosomes 5 and 17 
at map position of D5Mit259 and H-2, respectively, associated with DBA/1 
alleles, while there was no loci associated with arthritis of MRL-Fas(lpr) mice 
previously identified. In a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, the locus 
on chromosome 5 showed the highest peak at map position 35 cM (LOD score 6.0). 
This study may indicate that the arthritis induced by extrinsic and intrinsic 
factors is under the control of a different combination of susceptibility genes 
with common and different alleles, possibly simulating the genetic heterogeneity 
of RA.
