A unique population of CD23(+) CD21(high) B cells in inflamed nodes (Bin) has 
been shown to accumulate in lymph nodes (LNs) draining inflamed joints of 
TNF-transgenic (TNF-tg) mice. Bin cells contribute to arthritis flare in mice by 
distorting node architecture and hampering lymphatic flow, but their existence 
in human inflamed LNs has not yet been described. Here, we report the 
characterization of resident B-cell populations in fresh popliteal lymph nodes 
(PLNs) from patients with severe lower limb diseases (non-RA) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) patients, and from banked, cryopreserved reactive and normal 
human LN single cell suspension samples. Bin-like B cells were shown to be 
significantly increased in reactive LNs, and strikingly elevated (>30% of total) 
in RA samples. Histopathology and immunofluorescence analyses were consistent 
with B follicular hyperplasia and histological alterations in RA vs. non-RA 
PLNs. This is the first description of Bin-like B cells in human inflamed LNs. 
Consistent with published mouse data, this population appears to be associated 
with inflammatory arthritis and distortion of LN architecture. Further analyses 
are necessary to assess the role of CD23(+) CD21(hi) Bin-like B cells in RA 
pathogenesis and arthritic flare.
