Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonism with monoclonal antibodies is an 
effective therapy for severe Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent 
studies have suggested that induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells 
contributes to this therapeutic effect. We investigated whether infliximab (a 
mouse-human IgG1 chimeric anti-TNF monoclonal antibody) could induce apoptosis 
in vivo in human-mouse chimeras, created by reconstitution of severe combined 
immunodeficiency/beige mice with THP-1 (human monocytic cell line) or Jurkat 
cells (human T cell line). Infliximab treatment of chimeric mice depleted spleen 
and peritoneum from THP-1 cells and Jurkat cells and decreased production of the 
human cytokines IL-10 and IL-12 in vivo. Cell death was shown to occur already 
within 1 h of treatment. Infliximab effects were independent of FcgammaR binding 
or complement activation. Cell death resulted from apoptosis induction in a 
caspase-dependent pathway, as evidenced by the in vitro protective effect of the 
pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyketone 
(Z-VAD-FMK). These data provide support for caspase-dependent apoptosis 
induction being the mechanism of action of infliximab in vivo.
