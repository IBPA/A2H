OBJECTIVE: It was tested as to why low-dose methotrexate (MTX) effective against 
rheumatoid arthritis poses considerable health risk at higher doses.
METHODS: The tumorigenic potential of My1/De blast cells was followed by 
cytology and by the kinetics of (18)FDG uptake. The toxicity of MTX on chromatin 
condensation was compared to predictive normal intermediates of chromosome 
condensation in control cells.
RESULTS: MTX below 0.1 µg/ml did not cause visible changes in interphase 
chromatin structure. At its lowest toxic concentration (0.1 µg/ml) chromatin 
margination was confined to the outer edge of the nucleus. Between 0.1 and 5 
µg/ml concentrations apoptotic chromatin shrinkage correlated with the dose of 
MTX. Apoptosis was exerted in early S phase excluding the mitotic effect. At 
higher MTX concentrations (>10 µg/ml) necrotic disruption and expansion took 
place. The lowest necrotic concentration (10 µg/ml) was close to highest 
apoptotic MTX concentration (5 µg/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: The switch from apoptosis to inflammatory necrosis taking place 
within a narrow concentration range supports the notion of a narrow therapeutic 
spectrum. Chromatin changes are early markers of genotoxicity at much lower 
concentrations than citogenetic changes in properly chosen sensitive cells.
