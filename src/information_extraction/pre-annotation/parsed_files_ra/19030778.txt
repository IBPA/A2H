RNA interference (RNAi) provides a powerful means of sequence-specific gene 
silencing. Several studies show that RNAi may provide promising strategies to 
treat human diseases by suppressing disease responsible genes in vivo. In 
locomotor diseases, the progression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is 
suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-specific small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) delivered into the joint. The aim of this study, is to compare the 
effects of intraarticularly administered siRNAs targeting TNF-alpha, 
interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and receptor activator of 
NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) on CIA in rats. We confirmed that the silencing effects 
of siRNA duplexes specific for rat TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and RANKL in vitro. 
Each siRNA was also delivered into the knee joint of CIA rats by the in vivo 
electroporation method 7, 10, 13 and 16 days after immunization with collagen. 
Local delivery of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta-specific siRNA ameliorated CIA in rats 
effectively at the gross morphological, radiographical and histological 
evaluations. Our results suggested that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were the 
cytokines to be targeted in the joint for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
The in vivo siRNA transfection method may be useful for selection of target 
molecules to be silenced for treatment of joint diseases.
