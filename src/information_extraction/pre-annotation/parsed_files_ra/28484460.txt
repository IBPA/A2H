Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stromal cells with 
immunomodulatory properties. They have emerged as a very promising treatment for 
autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that MSCs, administered systemically, migrate to 
lymphoid tissues associated with the inflammatory site where functional 
MSC-induced immune cells with a regulatory phenotype were increased mediating 
the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs. These results suggest that homing of MSCs 
to the lymphatic system plays an important role in the mechanism of action of 
MSCs in vivo. Thus, we hypothesized that direct intralymphatic (IL) (also 
referred as intranodal) administration of MSCs could be an alternative and 
effective route of administration for MSC-based therapy. Here, we report the 
feasibility and efficacy of the IL administration of human expanded adipose 
mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). IL administration of eASCs attenuated the severity and progression of 
arthritis, reduced bone destruction and increased the levels of regulatory T 
cells (CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ cells) and Tr1 cells (IL10+CD4+), in spleen and draining 
lymph nodes. Taken together, these results indicate that IL administration of 
eASCs is very effective in modulating established CIA and may represent an 
alternative treatment modality for cell therapy with eASCs.
