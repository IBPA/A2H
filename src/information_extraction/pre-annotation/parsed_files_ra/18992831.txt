Hyperproliferation of synovial fibroblasts is considered to be a pivotal event 
in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Luteolin, a flavonoid, 
inhibits the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts in collagen-induced arthritic 
rats. Treatment with luteolin also decreases the secretion of matrix 
metalloprotease-1 and -3 and the expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and TGF-beta. 
Luteolin treatment caused a delay of cells in the G(2)/M phase. Interestingly, 
combination treatment with luteolin and TNF-alpha exhibited a synergistic 
inhibitory effect in all experiments. Western blotting demonstrated that 
treatment with luteolin alone or combined with TNF-alpha inhibited the MAPK/ERKs 
and PI3K-Akt pathways. These results indicate that luteolin inhibits the 
proliferation and partially blocks the pathogenic function of synovial 
fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis.
