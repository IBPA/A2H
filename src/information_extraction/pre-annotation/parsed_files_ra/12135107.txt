MeOH extract of Kochia scoparia was fractionated into CHCl3-, EtOAc- and BuOH 
extracts and the last fraction were hydrolyzed by 3%-NaOH (MeOH-H2O) to compare 
the bioactivities on antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. Silica gel 
column chromatography of BuOH fraction afforded a large amount of 
3-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl (1-->3)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl oleanolic acid 
(momordin lc, 4) and that of acid hydrolysate of BuOH fraction gave 
3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl oleanolic acid (momordin lb, 3), its 6'-O-methyl 
ester (2) and oleanolic acid (1). Silica gel column chromatography of alkaline 
hydrolysate afforded a large amount of 4. MeOH extract and both EtOAc- and BuOH 
fractions were active in the rheumatoidal rat induced Freund's complete adjuvant 
reagent (FCA) whereas CHCl3 fraction was inactive. Compound 1 and 4 showed 
significant activities in the same assay but oleanolic acid 
3-O-glucuronopyranoside (3) showed no activity. These fashions were also 
observed in carrageenan-induced edema of the rat and in the antinociceptive 
activity tests undertaken in hot plate- and writhing methods. These results 
suggest that momordin lc and its aglycone, oleanolic acid, could be active 
principles for rheumatoid arthritis.
