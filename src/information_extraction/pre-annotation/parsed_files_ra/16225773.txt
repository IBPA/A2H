SKG mouse, as a model of spontaneous rheumatoid arthritis (RA) bred recent 
years, is similar to the patients with RA. We analyzed the clonotypes of T cell 
infiltrating into joints of SKG mice in initial stage and late stage of RA by 
using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequent 
single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). The results indicated that the 
percentages of clonotypes TCR Vbeta2 and Vbeta8.2 of T cell clonotypes increased 
obviously to 72.3% and 60.2%, respectively. Mice number with identical TCR 
Vbeta2 and Vbeta8.2 clonotypes also clearly increased in late stage of disease 
to 100% and 75%, respectively. These results mean that T cells with TCR Vbeta2 
and Vbeta8.2 clonotypes probably play an important role in RA progression of SKG 
mouse. Sequencing of the extracted DNA verified that common bands on SSCP gel 
were derived from the same T cell clones among samples from different joints. 
The results we obtained implied that RT-PCR/SSCP method was a sensitive and 
credible method for analyzing T cell clonotypes. When the T cells of SKG mouse 
were adoptively transferred to a nude mouse, it was verified that the T cells 
infiltrating into joints were related to morbid formation of RA.
