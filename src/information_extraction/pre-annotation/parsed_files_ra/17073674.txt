Rheumatoid Arthritis, RA, is a common polygenic multi-factorial chronic 
inflammatory disorder that involves complex interactions between genetic and 
environmental factors. Despite major advances, the aetiology of the disease is 
still not completely understood. In this post-genome era, the sequencing of the 
human and some murine genomes as well as advances in global screening 
technologies offer an opportunity to accelerate the search for new pathological 
pathways and to identify new therapeutic targets. Animal models of RA offer an 
opportunity to dissect the genetic basis of disease in a simplified genome and 
controlled environment with the aim of identifying new pathological pathways and 
thus new therapeutic targets. Linkage analysis in the mouse model has identified 
more than 60 Loci, controlling disease phenotypes, immune response and 
cytokines. This indicates that gene variations among inbred mice strains affect 
the disease and that those polymorphic genes could be potential therapeutic 
targets. However, progress in identification of susceptibility genes in mouse 
models is slow. The progress is hampered by the complexity of disease as well as 
the traditional genetic dissection strategies. In this post-genome era, the 
sequencing of the human and some murine genomes as well as advances in global 
screening technologies offer an opportunity to accelerate the progress.
