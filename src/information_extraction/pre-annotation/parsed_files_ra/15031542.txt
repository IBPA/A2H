Lactoferrin (LF) is a ubiquitous protein which exists in milk, plasma, synovial 
fluids, cerebrospinal fluid and other biological fluids. LF is also well known 
as a natural immunomodulator. Recently, we found that bovine milk-derived LF 
(BLF) produced micro-opioid receptor-mediated analgesia. In this study, we 
examined whether oral administration of BLF causes anti-nociceptive and 
anti-inflammatory effects, and also whether it modulates LPS-induced TNF-alpha 
and IL-10 production in rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rat adjuvant 
arthritis. BLF was administrated once daily, starting 3 hr before (preventive 
experiment) or 19 days after (therapeutic experiment) adjuvant injection. In 
both experiments, BLF suppressed the development of arthritis and the 
hyperalgesia in the adjuvant-injected paw. The single-administered BLF produced 
a dose-dependent analgesia, which was reversed by naloxone, in the adjuvant 
arthritis rats. Both repeated and single administration of BLF suppressed 
TNF-alpha production and increased IL-10 production in the LPS-stimulated 
adjuvant arthritis rats. These results suggest that orally administered BLF has 
both preventive and therapeutic effects on the development of adjuvant-induced 
inflammation and pain. Moreover, the immunomodulatory properties of BLF, such as 
down-regulation of TNF-alpha and up-regulation of IL-10, could be beneficial in 
the treatment of RA. Thus, we concluded that LF can be safely used as a natural 
drug for RA patients suffering from joint pain.
