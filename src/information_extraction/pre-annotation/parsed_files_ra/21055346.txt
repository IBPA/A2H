AIM: To explore effects of total glucosides of paeonia (TGP)on the NF-κB/p65 
protein expression in paws of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats, and the contents 
of serum TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 in RA rats serum.
METHODS: Type II collagen-induced arthritis model in SD rats was established. 
The expression of NF-κB/p65 proteins in rat, s paw tissues was detected by 
immunohistochemical staining. The contents of serum TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 in RA 
rats were detected by ELISA.
RESULTS: TGP could down-regulate the expression of NF-κB/ p65 protein and 
contents of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 in RA rats.
CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of TGP on anti-inflammation maybe related to 
decreasing the expression of NF-κB/p65 protein and suppressing the production of 
TNF-α and IL-1β in RA rats.
