Despite a number of published reports, including from our own laboratory, 
suggesting that adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduces mouse synovium, a 
careful analysis demonstrated transduction predominantly of the subsynovial 
muscle tissue, while the synovial lining is poorly transduced. To investigate 
the potential of AAV to transduce human synovium, three human rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and two murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) synovial cell 
lines were infected with recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors encoding either mouse 
IL-10 or IL-4. Low-level transgene expression was observed. However, either 
Gamma-irradiation or the addition of a low-titer E1-, E3-deleted recombinant 
adenovirus resulted in up to a 100-fold increase in transgene product in the 
human, but not the mouse, cell lines. RA synovial tissues implanted 
subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which were 
subsequently infected with rAAV, showed marked increases in transgene expression 
when co-infected with adenovirus. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
show that intact human synovial tissues can be transduced by rAAV, and it 
suggests that murine arthritis may not be an optimal model to study rAAV as a 
gene transfer vector. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms limiting gene 
transduction in human synovium may allow optimization of this vector for the 
treatment of arthritis.
