Smilax glabra Roxb. (Tufuling) and Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet 
(Tubeimu) are used as couplet medicine in traditional Chinese medicine for the 
treatment of arthritis. This study is conducted to provide evidence on their 
therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to explore its possible 
mechanisms of action. The identification and quantification of representative 
components (Astilbin and Tubeimoside I) in the n-butyl alcohol fraction of this 
couplet medicine (BFCM) were carried out by HPLC-UV assays. The contents of 
Astilbin and Tubeimoside I in BFCM were 13.13% (15.434 min) and 3.4% (18.619 
min) respectively. For the assessment of anti-RA and anti-inflammatory 
activities, a carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats was used. The swelling 
rates of paws and levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the swelling tissue were 
determined. We observed that the BFCM exhibited significant inhibitory activity 
on carrageenan-induced paw edema model (p<0.01). The down regulated levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (all p<0.05) were reported. The results indicate that BFCM 
possesses significant anti-RA and anti-inflammatory effects, and it has a 
potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent against RA.
