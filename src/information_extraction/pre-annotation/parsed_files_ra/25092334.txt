Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (immunocytokines) are innovative 
biopharmaceutical agents, which are being considered for the therapy of cancer 
and chronic inflammatory conditions. Immunomodulatory fusion proteins capable of 
selective localization at the sites of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are of 
particular interest, as they may increase the therapeutic index of the cytokine 
payload. The F8 antibody recognizes the alternatively spliced extra domain A of 
fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis, which is strongly overexpressed at sites 
of arthritis. In this study, we investigated the targeting and therapeutic 
activity of the immunocytokine F8-IL4 in the mouse model of collagen-induced 
arthritis. Different combination regimes were tested and evaluated by the 
analysis of serum and tissue cytokine levels. We show that F8-IL4 selectively 
localizes to neovascular structures at sites of rheumatoid arthritis in the 
mouse, leading to high local concentrations of IL4. When used in combination 
with dexamethasone, F8-IL4 was able to cure mice with established 
collagen-induced arthritis. Response to treatment was associated with an 
elevation of IL13 levels and decreased IL6 plasma concentrations. A fully human 
version of F8-IL4 is currently being developed for clinical investigations.
