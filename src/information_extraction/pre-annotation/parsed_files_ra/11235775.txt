Whereas the DRB1 alleles have well-established associations with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), the DQ and DP alleles are of more controversial relevance to RA. 
Early studies of the DQB1 genes in RA determined the frequencies of the two 
DQB1*03 subtypes that are in linkage disequilibrium with DR4, DQB1*0301 (DQw7) 
and *0302 (DQw8). Their results are conflicting and difficult to interpret 
because molecular biology techniques for determining DR4 specificity 
polymorphism were not available at the time. None of the more recent studies 
found compelling evidence that the DQB1 alleles influenced the susceptibility to 
RA. A few studies suggest that the DQ alleles may influence the clinical or 
biological expression of the disease, perhaps through a complementary effect of 
the DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. DR-DQ complementarity has been demonstrated in the 
DQ8 transgenic mouse model, although this is not necessarily relevant to the 
human disease. The role of DPB1 remains hypothetical but may involve an 
influence of some alleles in relatively mild forms of RA. The DQB1 and DPB1 
alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium with the DRB1 alleles, making the 
elucidation of their independent effects a challenging task. Studies are needed 
to determine whether these linkage disequilibriums can influence the development 
of autoimmune diseases.
