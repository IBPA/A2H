Maharasnadhi Quathar (MRQ) is a polyherbal preparation recommended by Ayurvedic 
medical practitioners for treatment of arthritic conditions. An investigation 
has been carried out with rats and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, to 
determine the anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of MRQ. Results obtained 
demonstrate that MRQ can significantly and dose-dependently inhibit 
carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema (the inhibition at 3h was greater than at 1h 
after induction of oedema). MRQ could also increase the reaction time of rats in 
the hot-plate test (by 57% after the first hour of treatment), although it had 
no effect on the reaction time in the tail-flick test, indicating that MRQ 
possesses analgesic activity that is probably mediated via a supra-spinal 
effect.MRQ also exerted a dose-dependent (a) protective effect on heat-induced 
erythrocyte lysis, and (b) inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity. In RA 
patients, after 3 months of MRQ treatment, there was a marked improvement in the 
pain and inflammation experienced by the patients as well as in the mobility of 
the affected joints. From the overall results obtained, it may be concluded that 
MRQ possesses significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Alteration 
in synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, membrane stabilization and 
anti-oxidant activity are some of the possible mechanisms through which MRQ 
mediates its anti-arthritic effects.
