Osteoclasts are responsible for bone erosion in diseases such as osteoporosis 
and rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we investigate the effects of 
eriodictyol, a flavonoid found naturally in citrus fruits, on the receptor 
activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation using 
mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Eriodictyol inhibited RANKL-induced 
osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. In 
addition, eriodictyol suppressed bone resorption activity of differentiated 
osteoclasts. The inhibitory effect of eriodictyol was associated with impaired 
activation of multiple signaling events downstream of RANK, including 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun terminal kinase 
phosphorylation, followed by decreased nuclear factor of activated T cells 
(NFAT)c1 expression. Ectopic overexpression of a constitutively active form of 
NFATc1 completely rescued the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of eriodictyol, 
suggesting that the anti-osteoclastogenic effect was mainly attributed to the 
reduction in NFATc1 expression. Consistent with the in vitro 
anti-osteoclastogenic effect, eriodictyol suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced 
osteoclast formation in the calvarial model and ovariectomy-induced bone loss in 
vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrate that eriodictyol is a new therapeutic 
agent with the potential to prevent bone destructive diseases by reducing both 
osteoclast differentiation and function.
