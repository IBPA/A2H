Hyperproduction of Interleukin-6(IL-6) is observed in the rheumatoid 
arthritis(RA) patients and serum level of IL-6 is closely related to disease 
activity. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine and its hyperfunctions explain most of 
the clinical symptoms in RA. Since MRA is humanized antibody from a mouse 
anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody, MRA can be administered repeatedly because of 
its low antigenesity to human. MRA inhibits IL-6 function by the blocking IL-6 
binding to IL-6 receptor, resulting the prevention of development on collagen 
inducing arthritis(CIA) in cynomolgus monkeys whose IL-6R is cross-reacted with 
MRA. These evidence suggest that MRA has anti-arthritic effects. Clinical trials 
of MRA for RA patients have already started, and MRA therapy is effective as 
well as anti-TNF alpha and anti-IL-1 therapies.
