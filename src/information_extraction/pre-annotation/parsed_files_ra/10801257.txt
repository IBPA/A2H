Crohn's Disease (CD) affects more than 500,000 individuals in the United States 
and represents the second most common chronic inflammatory disorder after 
rheumatoid arthritis. Although major advances have been made in defining the 
basic mechanisms underlying chronic intestinal inflammation, the precise 
etiopathogenesis of CD remains unknown. We have recently characterized two novel 
mouse models of enteritis that express a CD-like phenotype, namely the TNF 
DeltaARE model of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) overexpression and the SAMP1/Yit 
model of spontaneous ileitis. The unique feature of these models is that they 
closely resemble CD for location and histopathology. These genetically 
manipulated new models of intestinal inflammation offer a powerful tool to 
investigate potential causes of human disease and may allow the development of 
novel disease-modifying therapeutic modalities for the treatment of CD.
