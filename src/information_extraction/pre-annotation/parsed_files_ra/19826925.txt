A certain relationship was observed between the gastrointestinal system, 
arthritis and immune system. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an altered 
microflora composition and disturbed intestinal defensive barrier. Effect of 
probiotic bacteria (Colinfant; COL) with known favorable effect on intestinal 
microflora was determined on the methotrexate (MTX) treatment of adjuvant 
arthritis. Rats with adjuvant arthritis were administered methotrexate 0.5 mg/kg 
body mass 2-times weekly per os, COL 1 mL/kg body mass every second day per os, 
and a combination of MTX+COL for a period of 28 d from the immunization. Levels 
of serum albumin, body mass, changes in hind paw swelling, and arthrogram score 
were estimated in rats as variables of inflammation and destructive 
arthritis-associated changes. Treatment with MTX, as well as with the 
combination treatment with MTX+COL significantly inhibited both inflammation and 
destructive arthritis-associated changes. The combination treatment inhibited 
both the hind paw swelling and arthrogram score more remarkably than MTX alone; 
on the other hand, the difference between combination treatment and MTX alone 
was not significant. Treatment with COL alone had no effect on adjuvant 
arthritis in rats. Colinfant can increase the preventive effect of MTX treatment 
in rat adjuvant arthritis by improving its antiarthritic effects.
