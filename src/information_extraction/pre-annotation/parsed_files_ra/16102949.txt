In this article, we will review B lymphocyte development and function, then 
discuss the role of B cells in RA, including immune complex formation; the K/BxN 
mouse model of RA; toll-like receptors; B cells as antigen presenting cells; 
germinal center-like structures in RA synovium; and influence on T cell 
activation, leukocyte infiltration, and angiogenesis. With regard to 
autoantibody production, we will focus on rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP 
antibodies, particularly mechanisms of their production; sensitivity and 
specificity in RA; and their roles as prognostic factors. Other autoantibodies 
will be discussed, as will treatment implications and future areas of 
investigation related to B cells and autoantibodies in RA.
