OBJECTIVE: To examine cytokine and chemokine production during the evolution of 
rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), a model of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Clinical and laboratory assessment of the course of AIA was performed 
over a 47-day period. Levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor a 
(TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6, as well as levels of the 
chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and JE, the 
murine homolog of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, were determined by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the sera and joints of AIA and control 
rats. Synovia from AIA rats were (immuno)histochemically analyzed. Results of 
cytokine and chemokine measurements were correlated with clinical and laboratory 
markers of inflammation and histology.
RESULTS: Early (before day 14 post adjuvant injection) and later phases of AIA 
could be distinguished. Cytokine and chemokine production was increased in AIA 
versus control rats. The production of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and, as 
determined earlier, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78-like protein was 
abundant prior to and during the course of AIA, while that of IL-6 and JE was 
elevated in the late phase of AIA. Cytokine and chemokine levels were correlated 
with the clinical symptoms of arthritis and blood neutrophil counts. Joint 
levels of IL-1beta showed correlation with synovial lining proliferation and 
neutrophil ingress into AIA synovium.
CONCLUSION: Cytokines and chemokines are involved in the clinical, laboratory, 
and histologic changes underlying AIA. The production of these mediators may be 
temporally and spatially regulated. These findings may be important for the 
optimal timing of cytokine and chemokine targeting.
