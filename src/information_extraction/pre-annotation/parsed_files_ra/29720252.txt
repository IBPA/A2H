BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preferentially affects women, with the 
peak incidence coinciding with estrogen decrease in menopause. Estrogen (E2) may 
therefore have intrinsic immune-regulatory properties that vanish with 
menopause. Fc sialylation is a crucial factor determining the inflammatory 
effector function of antibodies. We therefore analyzed whether E2 affects 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) sialylation.
METHODS: Postmenopausal (ovariectomized) mice were immunized with ovalbumin and 
treated with E2 or vehicle. Total and ovalbumin-specific IgG concentrations, 
sialylation, and Fcγ receptor expression were analyzed. Postmenopausal women 
with RA receiving hormone replacement therapy, including E2, or no treatment 
were analyzed for IgG sialylation. Furthermore, effects of E2 on the expression 
of the sialylation enzyme β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (St6Gal1) were 
studied in mouse and human antibody-producing cells.
RESULTS: E2 treatment significantly increased Fc sialylation of total and 
ovalbumin-specific IgG in postmenopausal mice. Furthermore, E2 led to increased 
expression of inhibitory Fcγ receptor IIb on bone marrow leukocytes. Treatment 
with E2 also increased St6Gal1 expression in mouse and human antibody-producing 
cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for the increase in IgG-Fc 
sialylation. In postmenopausal women with RA, treatment with E2 significantly 
increased the Fc sialylation of IgG.
CONCLUSIONS: E2 induces anti-inflammatory effector functions in IgG by inducing 
St6Gal1 expression in antibody-producing cells and by increasing Fc sialylation. 
These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of 
RA in conditions with low estrogen levels such as menopause.
