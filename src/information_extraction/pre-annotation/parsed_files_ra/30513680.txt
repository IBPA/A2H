This study was performed to elucidate the molecular function of the synoviocyte 
proliferation-associated in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 1/serum amyloid 
A-like 1 (SPACIA1/SAAL1) in mice CIA, an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), and human RA-synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). SPACIA1/SAAL1-deficient mice 
were generated and used to create mouse models of CIA in mild or severe disease 
conditions. Cell cycle-related genes, whose expression levels were affected by 
SPACIA1/SAAL1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), were screened. Transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional effects of SPACIA1/SAAL1 siRNA on cyclin-dependent kinase 
(cdk) 6 gene expression were investigated in human RASFs. 
SPACIA1/SAAL1-deficient mice showed later onset and slower progression of CIA 
than wild-type mice in severe disease conditions, but not in mild conditions. 
Expression levels of cdk6, but not cdk4, which are D-type cyclin partners, were 
downregulated by SPACIA1/SAAL1 siRNA at the post-transcriptional level. The 
exacerbation of CIA depends on SPACIA1/SAAL1 expression, although CIA also 
progresses slowly in the absence of SPACIA1/SAAL1. The CDK6, expression of which 
is up-regulated by the SPACIA1/SAAL1 expression, might be a critical factor in 
the exacerbation of CIA.
