AIM OF STUDY: This study was performed to elicit the effectiveness of bee venom 
(BV), a traditional immunosuppressive Korean acupuncture agent, on the 
maturation of dendrtic cells (DCs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immature dendritic cells (iDCs) were generated from mouse 
bone marrow cells with GM-CSF. After 10 days of initial differentiation, DCs 
were activated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) for another 48h in the presence or 
absence of BV. Surface molecule analysis, intracytoplasmic staining of 
cytokines, FITC-conjugated antigen uptake, and transwell migration assays were 
conducted with iDCs and activated DCs.
RESULTS: Up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, typical of mature DCs (mDCs) 
was inhibited by addition of BV. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were also found to 
be reduced with BV treatment in LPS-stimulated DC. A decrease in antigen uptake 
upon the maturation of DC was reversed in low dose BV treated mDC. In addition, 
BV treated mDC demonstrated reduced directional migration in response to CCL21, 
a lymphoid chemokine which directs mDC.
CONCLUSIONS: BV may have a therapeutic effect an on abnormally activated immune 
status, such as autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis, through an immune-modulatory 
effect on DC.
