Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis mouse models, we demonstrate 
that RA and periodontitis share many pathological features, such as deregulated 
cytokine production, increased immune-cell infiltration, increased expression of 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and enhanced osteoclast activity and bone erosion. 
We reveal that genetic deletion of cathepsin K (Ctsk) caused a radical reduction 
in inflammation and bone erosion within RA joint capsules and periodontal 
lesions, a drastic decrease in immune-cell infiltration, and a significant 
reduction in osteoclasts, macrophages, dendritic and T-cells. Deficiency of Ctsk 
greatly decreased the expression of TLR-4, 5, and 9 and their downstream 
cytokines in periodontal gingival epithelial lesions and synovial RA lesions. 
Hence, Ctsk may be targeted to treat RA and periodontitis simultaneously due to 
its shared osteoimmune role.
