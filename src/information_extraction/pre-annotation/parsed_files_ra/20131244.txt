OBJECTIVE: In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the joint inflammation 
referred to as Jaccoud's arthritis that occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) is nonerosive. Although the mechanism responsible is unknown, the 
antiosteoclastogenic cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha), whose transcriptome 
is present in SLE monocytes, may be responsible. This study was undertaken to 
examine the effects of IFNalpha and lupus on osteoclasts and erosion in the (NZB 
x NZW)F(1) mouse model of SLE with K/BxN serum-induced arthritis.
METHODS: Systemic IFNalpha levels in (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice were elevated by 
administration of AdIFNalpha. SLE disease was marked by anti-double-stranded DNA 
(anti-dsDNA) antibody titer and proteinuria, and Ifi202 and Mx1 expression 
represented the IFNalpha transcriptome. Microfocal computed tomography was used 
to evaluate bone erosions. Flow cytometry for CD11b and CD11c was used to 
evaluate the frequency of circulating osteoclast precursors (OCPs) and myeloid 
dendritic cells (DCs) in blood.
RESULTS: Administration of AdIFNalpha to (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice induced 
osteopetrosis. (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice without autoimmune disease were fully 
susceptible to focal erosions in the setting of serum-induced arthritis. 
However, (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice with high anti-dsDNA antibody titers and the 
IFNalpha transcriptome were protected against bone erosions. AdIFNalpha 
pretreatment of NZW mice before K/BxN serum administration also resulted in 
protection against bone erosion (r(2) = 0.4720, P < 0.01), which was associated 
with a decrease in the frequency of circulating CD11b+CD11c- OCPs and a 
concomitant increase in the percentage of CD11b+CD11c+ cells (r(2) = 0.6330, P < 
0.05), which are phenotypic of myeloid DCs.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFNalpha in SLE shifts monocyte 
development toward myeloid DCs at the expense of osteoclastogenesis, thereby 
resulting in decreased bone erosion.
