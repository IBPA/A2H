Multidrug-resistant enterococcal pathogens, especially vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci (VRE), are among the pathogens that require new antibiotic 
innovation. The colonization of the gut represents a major pathway by which VRE 
can cause infection and spread to other patients. In the current study, 
auranofin (FDA-approved rheumatoid arthritis drug) is evaluated for its 
potential use as a decolonizing agent for VRE. Auranofin was found to exert 
potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of enterococcal clinical 
isolates with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 μg/mL. No resistant 
mutants could be developed against auranofin over the course of 14 passages. 
Auranofin was also found to exert potent anti-biofilm activity against VRE. 
Auranofin was superior to linezolid, the drug of choice for VRE infection 
treatment, in the in vivo mouse model. Auranofin significantly reduced the VRE 
burden in feces, cecum, and ileum contents after 8 days of treatment. 
Accordingly, this study provides valuable evidence that auranofin has 
significant promise as a novel gastrointestinal decolonizing agent for VRE.
