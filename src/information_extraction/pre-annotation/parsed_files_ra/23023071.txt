Recent imaging studies on intact lymph nodes (LNs) of naïve T cell receptor 
(TCR)-transgenic mice have reported that T cells reduce their motility upon 
contact with relevant antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Using in vivo two-photon 
imaging of T cells in joint-draining (JD) LNs, we examined whether similar 
changes in T cell motility are observed in wild type mice. Co-transfer of T 
cells from naïve mice and antigen-experienced T cells from mice with 
proteoglycan (PG)-induced arthritis into naïve or arthritic recipients resulted 
in prolonged interactions of antigen-experienced T cells with APCs upon 
intra-articular antigen (PG) injection, indicating that T cells from arthritic 
wild type mice recapitulate the motile behavior reported in naïve TCR-transgenic 
mice. However, naïve T cells also engaged in stable interactions with APCs in 
the JDLNs of arthritic recipients, suggesting an enhanced ability of APCs in the 
JDLNs of arthritic hosts to present antigen to either naïve or 
antigen-experienced T cells.
