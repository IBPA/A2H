Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and 
multiple inflammatory cytokines are involved in RA pathogenesis. Interleukin 
(IL)-18, in particular, has a significant positive correlation with RA. In this 
study, we investigated the effect of erythroid differentiation regulator 1 
(Erdr1), which is negatively regulated by IL-18, in an animal model of 
inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. 
Treatment of mice with recombinant (r)Erdr1 significantly suppressed the 
severity of arthritis, histologic features of arthritic tissue, and serum levels 
of anti-collagen autoantibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgM) in CIA. In addition, 
IL-18 expression was reduced in the affected synovium of rErdr1-treated mice. 
Interestingly, Erdr1 treatment suppressed migration in contrast to the 
pro-migratory effect of IL-18, indicating the therapeutic effects of Erdr1 on 
CIA through inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration. In addition, Erdr1 
inhibited activation of ERK1/2, a key signaling pathway in migration of various 
cell types. Taken together, these data show that rErdr1 exerts therapeutic 
effects on RA by inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration, suggesting that 
rErdr1 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for RA.
