Animal models have been used extensively in studies of rheumatoid arthritis 
pathogenesis. Despite the inherent limitations of all animal models, several 
rodent models have significantly progressed our understanding of the fundamental 
mechanisms underpinning rheumatoid arthritis and contributed to several current 
major advances in treatment. These models include the induced arthritis models 
such as collagen-induced arthritis, collagen-antibody-induced arthritis, 
zymosan-induced arthritis, and the methylated BSA model, and the genetically 
manipulated or spontaneous arthritis models such as the TNF-alpha-transgenic 
mouse, K/BxN mouse, and the Skg mouse. Here, we describe these animal models and 
discuss their advantages and limitations.
