Triptolide, a diterpenoid triepoxide from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF), 
has been proven to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory 
activities. It has been clinically used to treat patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), in which chemokines play an important role in immune and 
inflammatory responses. To investigate the effect of triptolide on MCP-1, 
MIP-1alpha and RANTES, we used complete Freund's adjuvant to induce 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in rats. AA in rat is a useful experimental 
model of human RA. Our data show that the thickness of arthritic ankle decreases 
with administration of triptolide. Both mRNA and protein levels of MCP-1, 
MIP-1alpha and RANTES in synovial tissue of rats with AA are significantly 
higher than those in normal rats. mRNA levels of MIP-1alpha and RANTES increase 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rats with AA in comparison with those 
in normal rats, whereas no MCP-1 mRNA can be detected. Triptolide can 
significantly inhibit rat AA induced over-expression of MCP-1, MIP-1alpha and 
RANTES at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. These results 
may contribute to the therapeutic effects of triptolide in rheumatoid arthritis.
