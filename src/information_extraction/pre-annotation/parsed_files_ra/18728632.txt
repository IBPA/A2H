MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNA molecules that modulate the 
expression of multiple target genes at the post-transcriptional level and are 
implicated in a wide array of cellular and developmental processes. In 
hematopoietic cells, miRNA levels are dynamically regulated during lineage 
differentiation and also during the course of the immune response. Mouse models 
have provided good evidence for miRNAs being key players in the establishment of 
hematopoietic lineages. Furthermore, miRNA-dependent alterations in gene 
expression in hematopoietic cells are critical for mounting an appropriate 
immune response to a wide range of pathogens, spontaneously emerging tumors, and 
autoimmune cells. Deregulation of hematopoietic-specific miRNA expression 
results in defects in both central and peripheral tolerance, hematopoietic 
malignancies, and sometimes both. Abnormal expression of miRNAs-which is 
implicated in inflammation-has also been found in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis. These findings identify miRNAs as critical targets for 
immunomodulatory drug development.
