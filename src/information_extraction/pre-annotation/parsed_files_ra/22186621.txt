Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in degeneration of the 
matrix associated with bone and cartilage. Regulation of osteoclast activity is 
essential in the treatment of bone disease, including osteoporosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis. Polyphenols in green tea, particularly 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), inhibit MMPs expression and activity. 
However, the effects of the black tea polyphenol, theaflavin-3,3'-digallate 
(TFDG), on osteoclast and MMP activity are unknown. Therefore, we examined 
whether TFDG and EGCG affect MMP activity and osteoclast formation and 
differentiation in vitro. TFDG or EGCG (10 and 100 ÂµM) was added to cultures of 
rat osteoclast precursors cells and mature osteoclasts. Numbers of 
multinucleated osteoclasts and actin rings decreased in polyphenol-treated 
cultures relative to control cultures. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were lower in 
TFDG- and EGCG-treated rat osteoclast precursor cells than in control cultures. 
MMP-9 mRNA levels declined significantly in TFDG-treated osteoclasts in 
comparison to control osteoclasts. TFDG and EGCG inhibited the formation and 
differentiation of osteoclasts via inhibition of MMPs. TFDG may suppress actin 
ring formation more effectively than EGCG. Thus, TFDG and EGCG may be suitable 
agents or lead compounds for the treatment of bone resorption diseases.
