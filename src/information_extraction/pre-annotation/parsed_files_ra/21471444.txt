Inflammatory cytokines like TNF play a central role in autoimmune disorders such 
as rheumatoid arthritis. We identified the tyrosine kinase bone marrow kinase on 
chromosome X (BMX) as an essential component of a shared inflammatory signaling 
pathway. Transient depletion of BMX strongly reduced secretion of IL-8 in cell 
lines and primary human cells stimulated by TNF, IL-1β, or TLR agonists. BMX was 
required for phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK, as well as activation of 
NF-κB. The following epistasis analysis indicated that BMX acts downstream of or 
at the same level as the complex TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-TAK1 binding 
protein. At the cellular level, regulation of the IL-8 promoter required the 
pleckstrin homology domain of BMX, which could be replaced by an ectopic 
myristylation signal, indicating a requirement for BMX membrane association. In 
addition, activation of the IL-8 promoter by in vitro BMX overexpression 
required its catalytic activity. Genetic ablation of BMX conferred protection in 
the mouse arthritis model of passive K/BxN serum transfer, confirming that BMX 
is an essential mediator of inflammation in vivo. However, genetic replacement 
with a catalytically inactive BMX allele was not protective in the same 
arthritis animal model. We conclude that BMX is an essential component of 
inflammatory cytokine signaling and that catalytic, as well as noncatalytic 
functions of BMX are involved.
