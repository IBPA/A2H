Recent studies have shown that pulsed magnetic fields (PMF) provide a practical, 
exogenous method for inducing cell and tissue modifications, as therapy for 
selected pathological states. A number of clinical studies, in vivo animal 
experiments and in vitro cellular and membrane research reports suggest that PMF 
stimulation can significantly reduce pain and accelerate the healing process. 
However, PMFs are still not widely used in clinical medicine. This research 
examines the effects of PMFs using an animal model that resembles human 
rheumatoid arthritis. Using serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and joint edema 
evaluation, we were able to monitor disease progression and PMF therapeutic 
effectiveness. We have used these methods to correlate changes in an acute phase 
serum protein, alpha-2-macroglobulin, with other indicators of rheumatoid 
arthritis in Lewis rats treated daily with PMF therapy. The results indicate 
that PMFs may be a promising non-invasive treatment for chronic inflammatory 
diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
