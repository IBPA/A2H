We have used phage display to isolate a range of human domain antibodies (dAbs) 
that bind to mouse, rat and/or human serum albumin (SA) and can be expressed at 
very high levels in bacterial, yeast or mammalian cell culture. In contrast to 
non-SA-binding dAbs, which have terminal half-lives of less than 45 min, the 
half-lives of these 12 kDa 'AlbudAbs' can match the half-life of SA itself. To 
demonstrate the use of AlbudAbs for extending the half-lives of therapeutic 
drugs, we created a fusion of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) 
with an AlbudAb. Soluble IL-1ra is potent inhibitor of IL-1 signalling that is 
approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but has a relatively short in 
vivo half-life. Here we show that although the AlbudAb/IL-1ra fusion has a 
similar in vitro potency, its in vivo efficacy can be dramatically improved due 
to its extended serum half-life. AlbudAbs could potentially be used to generate 
a range of long half-life versions of many different drugs in order to improve 
their dosing regimen and/or clinical effect.
