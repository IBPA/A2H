Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease hallmarked by aberrant 
cellular homeostasis, resulting in hyperactive CD4+ T cells that are more 
resistant to apoptosis. Both hyperactivation and resistance to apoptosis may 
contribute to the pathogenicity of CD4+ T cells in the autoimmune process. A 
better knowledge of the mechanisms determining such impaired homeostasis could 
contribute significantly to both the understanding and the treatment of the 
disease. Here we investigated whether autophagy, is dysregulated in CD4+ T cells 
of RA patients, resulting in disturbed T-cell homeostasis. We demonstrate that 
the rate of autophagy is significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from RA 
patients, and that increased autophagy is also a feature of in vitro activated 
CD4+ T cells. The increased apoptosis resistance observed in CD4+ T cells from 
RA patients was significantly reversed upon autophagy inhibition. These 
mechanisms may contribute to RA pathogenesis, as autophagy inhibition reduced 
both arthritis incidence and disease severity in a mouse collagen induced 
arthritis mouse model. Conversely, in Atg5flox/flox -CD4-Cre+ mice, in which all 
T cells are autophagy deficient, T cells showed impaired activation and 
proliferation. These data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of RA and 
underscore the relevance of autophagy as a promising therapeutic target.
