Adjuvant arthritis (AA) is an induced form of (sub)chronic arthritis. Strains of 
rats have a varying genetic susceptibility to AA, whereas mice generally are not 
susceptible. AA is most easily induced with mycobacteria suspended in oil, 
although in some strains of rats it can be induced with oily adjuvants in the 
absence of mycobacteria. The disease is a T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis 
that is frequently used to study immunological aspects of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and other arthritic or inflammatory diseases in humans. Furthermore, it is 
used as a model for developing and testing antiinflammatory drugs. There are no 
particularly well-defined autoantigens in AA; in this respect, the model 
resembles spontaneous arthritic diseases in humans. In all susceptible rat 
strains, the inflammatory process of AA is self remitting, although usually the 
disease is severe and leads to permanent joint malformations, including 
ankylosis; a time line for AA development is presented. This unit describes the 
induction and evaluation of AA and the preparation of adjuvant used to induce 
AA.
