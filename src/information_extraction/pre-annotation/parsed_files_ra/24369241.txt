OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of high-frequency ultrasound in evaluating 
articular lesions in a rat of model collagen-induced arthritis model (CIA).
METHODS: Sixty Wistar rats randomized into CIA group (n=50) and the control 
group (n=10), and in the former group, CIA was induced by immunization with 
collagen type II. On day 45, the ankle joint was assessed based on the arthritic 
index (AI) and examined with high-frequency ultrasound in all the rats. 
Histological evaluations of the joint were performed and the results were 
compared with ultrasound findings.
RESULTS: In CIA group, 62 ankles were confirmed pathologically to have synovitis 
with typical inflammatory cell infiltration and pannus formation. AI score-based 
diagnosis was confirmed in 42 ankles with a detection rate of 68% (42/62), 
significantly lower than the rate of 87% (54/62) with high-frequency ultrasound 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: High-frequency ultrasound is an ideal method for observing CIA in 
rats in vivo. High-frequency ultrasound can show blood flow in rheumatoid 
arthritis and is useful in studies of RA synovial angiogenesis.
