Calcineurin (CN) is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine 
phosphatase. In immune cells, CN controls the activity of a wide range of 
transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T, nuclear 
factor-kappa B, c-fos, and Elk-1. CN plays an important role in synoviocyte 
activation and arthritis progression in vivo and this function is tightly linked 
to dysregulated intracellular Ca(2+) store and Ca(2+) response triggered by 
proinflammatory cytokines. In the present study, transgenic mice expressing 
human calcineurin-binding protein 1 (hCabin1) were generated, driven by type II 
collagen promoter, and the efficiency of these mice was investigated by 
experimental arthritis. These transgenic mice successfully expressed hCabin1 in 
joint tissue as well as other organs such as liver, heart, and brain. The 
overexpression of hCabin1 reduced the disease severity during collagen-induced 
arthritis. In fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from hCabin1 transgenic mice, 
the productions of these cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and 
IFN-Î³, were decreased and matrix metalloproteinases were also depressed in 
transgenic mice FLS. In addition, these effects were only found in the joint 
tissue, which is a major inflammation site. These findings will provide a better 
knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis and a potential 
animal model of the chronic inflammatory conditions, including atherosclerosis 
and transplantation.
