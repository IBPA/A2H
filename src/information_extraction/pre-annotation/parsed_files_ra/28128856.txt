The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is incompletely understood. Human 
endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and their superantigenic envelope protein (env) 
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. In the present investigation, 
the arthritogenic potential of the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A 
(SEA) has been investigated. In the present investigation, the bacterial 
superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) was injected into the right knee 
joint of 15 Lewis rats. Further nine animals received saline. Animals were 
sacrificed one, five and 10Â days after the injection, respectively. The antigens 
CD3, CD4, CD8, MHC class I, MHC class II, Pax5 and CD138 were investigated by 
immunohistochemistry on cryo-sections. After intra-articular SEA injection, the 
inflammation was initially dominated by CD8+ T cells. In the course of the 
investigation, the numbers of CD4+, Pax5+, CD138+ and MHC class II+ cells 
increased. CD3 was expressed in low numbers as compared to CD8. After saline 
injection, no similar inflammatory response has been detected. The arthritis 
induced by the superantigen SEA may be a novel model for inflammatory joint 
diseases, that is rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
