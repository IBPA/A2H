Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study is to investigate the 
regulation and potential role of TLR2 in spleen of pristane-induced arthritis 
(PIA) rat, which can be used to further understand the mechanisms of RA. 
Arthritis in DA rats was induced by pristane. TLR2 expression in spleen was 
detected by real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting, and TLR2 expression 
at both mRNA and protein levels was upregulated in PIA rats. Peptidoglycan (PGN) 
was systemically administrated to PIA rats, and arthritis severity was evaluated 
macroscopically and microscopically. Results showed that systemic administration 
of PGN to PIA rats obviously deteriorated arthritis severity. TLR2 expression on 
splenocytes and different types of immune cells was measured by flow cytometry. 
And it was found that TLR2 was mainly expressed on antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) of spleen, and the proportion of TLR2(+) dendritic cells and macrophages 
in spleen of PIA rats was increased remarkably. Thus, we conclude that the 
induction of TLR2(+) APCs in spleen may participate in the maintenance of PIA.
