Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting 
the joint synovium. The normal synovium consists of a lining layer of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages, one to three cells deep that 
overlies the loose connective tissue of the synovial sublining. During the 
course of RA, the synovium is the site of inflammation where immune cells are 
massively infiltrated, and the lining layer becomes hyperplastic and transforms 
into a pannus tissue that destroys articular cartilage and bone. FLS play an 
important role in this RA pathogenesis. In this review, we explain that 
cadherin-11, an adhesion molecule, is selectively expressed on FLS and required 
for synovial lining formation. In addition, cadherin-11 on FLS contributes to 
synovial inflammation and mediates cartilage degradation in a mouse model of 
inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, we suggest that FLS are critical regulators 
of synovial inflammation and arthritis pathology via mechanisms that are 
mediated by cadherin-11.
