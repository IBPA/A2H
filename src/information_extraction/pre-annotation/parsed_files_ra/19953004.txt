TNF-alpha plays critical roles in bone-resorbing diseases, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. Recent evidence suggests that thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, have 
anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
TZDs on the TNF-alpha-mediated osteoclastogenesis of osteoclast precursor cells. 
TNF-alpha treatment of RAW264.7 murine macrophages or mouse bone marrow cells 
induced significant multinuclear osteoclast formation, and these differentiated 
osteoclast cells possessed bone-resorbing activity. The TZD drugs, rosiglitazone 
and pioglitazone, significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast 
differentiation from both cell types and subsequent bone resorption. Reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, reporter gene assays, and Western blot 
results revealed that TZD treatment significantly suppressed NFATc1 expression. 
Moreover, GW9662 (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonist) 
prevented the inhibitory effect of TZDs on NFATc1 expression and osteoclast 
differentiation. In summary, our results demonstrate that TZDs inhibit 
TNF-alpha-mediated osteoclast differentiation by downregulation of NFATc1 
expression. This observation increases the therapeutic applications of TZDs in 
inflammatory bone-resorbing diseases.
