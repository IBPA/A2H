Two protected derivatives of beta-D-galactopyranosyl-5-hydroxy-L-lysine, in 
which HO-4 of galactose has been O-methylated or replaced by fluorine, have been 
prepared. The building blocks were incorporated at position 264 of the peptide 
fragment CII259-273 from type II collagen by solid-phase synthesis. The ability 
of these two glycopeptides, and two CII259-273 glycopeptides in which HO-4 of 
galactose was either unmodified or deoxygenated, to elicit responses from T-cell 
hybridomas obtained in a mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis was then 
determined. The hybridomas were all highly sensitive towards modifications at 
C-4 of the beta-D-galactosyl residue of CII259-273, highlighting the role of 
HO-4 as an important contact point for the T-cell receptor. Most likely, this 
glycopeptide hydroxyl group is involved in hydrogen bonding with the T-cell 
receptor.
