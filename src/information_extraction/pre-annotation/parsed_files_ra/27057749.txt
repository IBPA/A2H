Glucocorticoid (GC) is the cornerstone therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, but high 
doses are associated with serious adverse effects. In an effort to improve the 
efficacy of low-dose GC therapy, we developed a micelle system for targeted 
delivery to inflamed joints and validated the approach in a rat model of 
arthritis. Micelles loaded with dexamethasone (Dex) self-assembled from the 
amphipathic poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG) polymer 
via film dispersion, and they were injected intravenously at a dose of only 
0.8mg/kg into rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The micelles persisted for a 
relatively long time in the circulation, and they accumulated preferentially in 
inflamed joints. Micelle-delivered Dex potently reduced joint swelling, bone 
erosion, and inflammatory cytokine expression in both joint tissue and serum. 
PCL-PEG micelles caused only moderate adverse effects on body weight, lymphocyte 
count and blood glucose concentration, and they weakly activated the host 
complement system. These results suggest that encapsulating Dex in PCL-PEG 
micelles may allow for safe and effective low-dose GC therapy targeting 
inflammatory disorders.
