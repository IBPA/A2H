The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of pro-protein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6), a proteinase implicated in the proteolytic 
activity of various precursor proteins and involved in the regulation of protein 
maturation, in fibroblast‑like synoviocytes (FLS) of a rat model of 
collagen‑induced arthritis (CIA). Cultured FLS from CIA models were subjected to 
small interfering RNA mediated PCSK6 knockdown, followed by assessment of the 
proliferation, invasive and migratory capacity, the secretion of inflammation 
factors and the cell cycle. Expression of genes associated with proliferation, 
invasion, migration and inflammation was detected by reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that PCSK6 knockdown significantly 
decreased the cell proliferation, invasion and migration of FLS from rats with 
CIA. ELISA showed an obvious decrease of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 
1β secretion, and flow cytometric analysis revealed G0/G1 arrest of FLS 
following PCSK6 knockdown. Furthermore, a decrease in the mRNA levels of 
inflammation‑associated chemokine CXCL9, angiogenesis‑associated genes MMP‑2, 
MMP‑9 and NOSTRIN, hypoxia‑associated gene HIF‑1α, adhesion‑associated gene 
MPZL2, proliferation‑associated gene IGF‑2 and citrullination‑associated gene 
PADI4 was detected after PCSK6 knockdown. The results of the present study 
indicated that inhibition of PCSK6 may have a protective role against synovitis 
in rheumatoid arthritis.
