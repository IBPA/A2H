Apium graveolens Linn. (Apiaceae) is an indigenous plant of the North and South 
Americas, Southern Europe, and Asia and has been widely used as a food or a 
traditional medicine for treatment of inflammation and arthritis. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the antioxidant effects of a methanolic extract of 
A. graveolens (AGE) against liver oxidative stress in an adjuvant-induced 
arthritic rat model. The AGE (250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg) was given orally for 24 
consecutive days after induction by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant. Liver 
and spleen weights were recorded. The superoxide anion level, total peroxide 
(TP), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
activity, total antioxidant status, and oxidative stress index (OSI) were also 
measured. AGE treatment significantly decreased the levels of the superoxide 
anion, TP, and OSI whereas the GPx and SOD activities significantly increased in 
the liver of the arthritic rats. These results indicated that AGE showed an 
ameliorative effect against liver oxidative stress in adjuvant-induced arthritic 
rats by reducing the generation of liver free radicals and increasing the liver 
antioxidant enzyme activity.
