Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases of global 
prevalence. The use of the anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of RA is 
associated with severe adverse reactions and toxicity. This limitation has 
necessitated the search for novel therapeutic products. We report here a 
traditional Chinese medicine-based herbal formula, Huo luo xiao ling dan (HLXL), 
which has potent antiarthritic activity as validated in the rat adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AA) model. HLXL (2.3 g/Kg) was fed to Lewis (RT.1(1)) rats daily by 
gavage beginning at the onset of arthritis and then continued through the 
observation period. HLXL inhibited the severity of ongoing AA. This suppression 
of arthritis was associated with significant alterations in the T cell 
proliferative and cytokine responses as well as the antibody response against 
the disease-related antigen, mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65). There 
was a reduction in the level of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-1β 
but enhancement of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level. In addition, 
there was inhibition of both the anti-Bhsp65 antibody response and the serum 
level of nitric oxide. Thus, HLXL is a promising CAM modality for further 
testing in RA patients.
