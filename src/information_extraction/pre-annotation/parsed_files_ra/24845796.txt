Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases of global 
prevalence. Irrespective of much research in RA disease, no drugs with capable 
safety profiles are yet available. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) 
synthesizes and transfers ADP ribose polymers to target proteins, and regulates 
DNA repair and genomic integrity maintenance. PARP-1 also plays a crucial role 
in the progression of the inflammatory response, and its inhibition confers 
protection in several models of inflammatory disorders. We investigated the 
possible anti-arthritic effects of the PARP-1 inhibitor 5-aminoisoquinolinone 
(5-AIQ) in a mouse model of adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA). In this study, we 
examined the effects of 5-AIQ on the key mediators of arthritic inflammation, 
namely, edema and arthritic score, T cell subsets, regulatory T (Treg) cells, 
IL-17A, GITR expressing cells, NF-kB p65, IkB-α and pro and anti-inflammatory 
mediators mRNA expression levels. PARP-1 inhibition 5-AIQ treatment 
significantly attenuated the severity of AIA, reduced the arthritis scores, a 
substantial reduction in the levels of T cell subsets, IL-17A, NF-kB p65, GITR 
expressing cells, and as well as the pro-inflammatory mediators. However, 5-AIQ 
significantly up-regulated the number of Tregs cells, IkB-α levels and mRNA 
expression of anti-inflammatory mediators. Our results suggest that treatment 
with 5-AIQ attenuated AIA in mice might offer a promising alternative/adjunct 
treatment for RA.
