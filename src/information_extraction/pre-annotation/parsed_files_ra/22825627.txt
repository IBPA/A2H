OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Interleukin (IL) 17 plays an important role in synovial 
inflammation and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while IL-27 
exerts a regulatory role in T cell-mediated immune responses. Our aim was to 
study the influence of IL-17 on IL-27 production in RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following injection of IL-17 in the knee joint of CIA 
mice, synovium was examined for IL-17 and IL-27 expression by western blot, 
real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. IL-17 and IL-27 levels were measured by 
ELISA in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) and in synovial 
fluid (SF) macrophages from RA patients.
RESULTS: IL-17 exacerbated disease progression in CIA mice. Histological 
analysis showed increased pannus formation associated with cartilage and bone 
erosion following injection with IL-17. The expression of IL-27 was increased in 
CIA mice. The expression of IL-17 and IL-27 was increased more in IL-17-injected 
CIA mice than in control mice. The majority of cells expressing IL-27 were 
co-localized with synovial macrophages. Increased expression of IL-27 by 
application of recombinant IL-17 was confirmed in CIA BM-DCs and in SF 
macrophages from RA patients.
CONCLUSION: IL-17 enhanced expression of IL-27 in synovial macrophages from RA 
patients and CIA mice, indicating an interaction between IL-17 and IL-27 as an 
autoregulatory mechanism.
