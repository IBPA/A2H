Wutou decoction is widely used in China because of its therapeutic effect on 
rheumatoid arthritis. Benzoylmesaconine (BMA), the most abundant component of 
Wutou decoction, was used as the marker compound for the pharmacokinetic study 
of Wutou decoction. The aim of the present study was to compare the 
pharmacokinetics of BMA in rats after oral administration of pure BMA and Wutou 
decoction. Pure BMA (5 mg/kg) and Wutou decoction (0.54 g/kg, equivalent to 5 
mg/kg BMA) were orally administered to rats with blood samples collected over 10 
h. Quantiﬁcation of BMA in rat plasma was achieved using sensitive and validated 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). 
Specifically, the half-life (T1/2) and mean residence time values of pure BMA 
were 228.3 ± 117.0 min and 155.0 ± 33.2 min, respectively, whereas those of BMA 
in Wutou decoction were decreased to 61.8 ± 35.1 min and 55.8 ± 16.4 min, 
respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of BMA after administration of 
Wutou decoction was significantly decreased (five-fold) compared with that of 
pure BMA. The results indicate that the elimination of BMA in rats after the 
administration of Wutou decoction was significantly faster compared with that of 
pure BMA.
