ARAP3, a GTPase activating protein for Rho and Arf family GTPases, is one of 
many phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) effectors. In this study, we 
investigate the regulatory input of PI3K upstream of ARAP3 by analyzing 
neutrophils from an ARAP3 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain point mutation 
knock-in mouse (R302, 303A), in which ARAP3 is uncoupled from activation by 
PI3K. ARAP3 PH domain point mutant neutrophils are characterized by disturbed 
responses linked to stimulation by either integrin ligands or immobilized immune 
complexes. These cells exhibit increased β2 integrin inside-out signaling 
(binding affinity and avidity), and our work suggests the disturbed responses to 
immobilized immune complexes are secondary to this. In vitro, neutrophil 
chemotaxis is affected in the mutant. In vivo, ARAP3 PH domain point mutant bone 
marrow chimeras exhibit reduced neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum on 
induction of sterile peritonitis and also reduced inflammation in a model for 
rheumatoid arthritis. The current work suggests a dramatic regulatory input of 
PI3K into the regulation of β2 integrin activity, and processes dependent on 
this, by signaling through its effector ARAP3.
