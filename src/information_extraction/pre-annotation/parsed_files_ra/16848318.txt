AIM: To study the active constituents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
from the ethyl acetate extracts of the roots of Lasianthus acuminatissimus Merr.
METHODS: Various chromatographic techniques were used to separate and purify the 
constituents. Their structures were established on the basis of 1D, 2D NMR and 
HRMS spectroscopic analyses and their preliminary evaluation of 
anti-inflammation effect on the release of beta-glucuronidase was carried out.
RESULTS: Eight compounds were isolated and identified as lasianthuslactone A 
(1), codonolactone (2), 2,5-dimethoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone (3), uncargenin A (4), 
nonadecyl alcohol (5), 13-docosenoic acid (6), tetracosanoic acid (7) and 
beta-sitosterol (8). Compound 3 showed a significant inhibitory effect on 
release of beta-glucuronidase rat polymorphous nuclear leukocytes activated by 
platelet activating factor (PAF).
CONCLUSION: Compound 1 is a new one, the others were isolated from the plant for 
the first time and 3 is one of active anti-inflammation compound in the plant.
