Although the glycoprotein MFG-E8 (milk fat globule-epidermal growth 
factor-factor 8) has been investigated extensively as an anti-inflammatory and 
homeostatic molecule, a possible role in bone homeostasis and disease was not 
addressed until recently. Our group has now shown that MFG-E8 is expressed by 
human and mouse osteoclasts and regulates their differentiation and function 
(Abe et al., J Immunol 2014;193:1383-1391). Whereas genetic deficiency or 
antibody-mediated neutralization of MFG-E8 enhances osteoclastogenesis and 
promotes inflammation-induced bone loss in mice, local administration of 
recombinant MFG-E8 blocks bone loss. These findings establish MFG-E8 as a novel 
homeostatic regulator of osteoclastogenesis and suggest that MFG-E8 could be 
exploited therapeutically to treat disorders associated with inflammatory bone 
loss, such as periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
