OBJECTIVE: To investigate how adults with one of several chronic illnesses 
(bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, or systemic lupus erythematosus) 
perceive their need to take medications during the course of their illness.
METHOD: Eighty-three adults, aged 18-64 years, all members of a health 
maintenance organization, were interviewed. Each participant completed an 
ethnographic interview that was transcribed verbatim and analysed using grounded 
theory techniques.
RESULTS: Participants described two forms of ongoing efforts to negotiate their 
need for medications, internal and external. The former category includes 
struggles over self-identify (e.g. worries about becoming dependent on drugs, 
feeling like a 'guinea pig'). The latter includes negotiations with health care 
providers over the type, route, and frequency of medication use. Dimensions of 
both negotiation types include acceptance and resistance. Specifically, patients 
with chronic illness must manage not only drug regimens, but also renegotiate 
their self-identities as formerly well persons. During this dynamic process, 
patients may accept and/or resist taking prescribed medications.
CONCLUSION: Practitioners should recognize that patients experience not only 
physical, but emotional side effects of medications, and that resistance might 
be part of a negotiation process rather than a final stance.
