OBJECTIVE: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are precursors of tissue of mesenchymal 
origin, but they also have the capacity to regulate the immune response by 
suppressing T and B lymphocyte proliferation in a non-major histocompatibility 
complex-restricted manner. Use of MSCs as immunosuppressant agents in autoimmune 
diseases has been proposed and successfully tested in animal models. We explored 
the feasibility of using allogeneic MSCs as therapy for collagen-induced 
arthritis, a mouse model for human rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: DBA/1 mice were immunized with type II collagen in Freund's complete 
adjuvant, and some of the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 
allogeneic MSCs.
RESULTS: A single injection of MSCs prevented the occurrence of severe, 
irreversible damage to bone and cartilage. MSCs induced hyporesponsiveness of T 
lymphocytes as evidenced by a reduction in active proliferation, and modulated 
the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In particular, the serum concentration 
of tumor necrosis factor alpha was significantly decreased. MSCs exerted their 
immunomodulatory function by educating antigen-specific Tregs.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an effective new therapeutic approach to target 
the pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune arthritis using allogeneic MSCs. However, 
further studies are required before these results can be translated to clinical 
settings.
