Recent evidences have suggested that the paucity of the apoptosis of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis. Apoptosis induction of rheumatoid arthritis FLS is 
therefore suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for rheumatoid 
arthritis. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), one of the main bioactive 
substances of animals' bile acid, could favorably ameliorate the progression 
development and bone destruction of adjuvant arthritis in rat. In this study, we 
aimed to investigate the possible effect of TCDCA on apoptosis induction of 
adjuvant arthritis FLS and the mechanisms involved in this process. Apoptosis 
was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Gene expression levels and the 
activities of caspase-3 and caspase-8 were evaluated using real time RT-PCR and 
luminogenic substrates. The activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was measured 
by ELISA. The results showed TCDCA significantly enhanced the apoptosis of 
adjuvant arthritis FLS in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, TCDCA treatment 
markedly increased the gene expression level and activity of both caspase-3 and 
caspase-8. It could suppress the DNA-biding activity of NF-κB. We concluded 
TCDCA represented an apoptotic effect on adjuvant arthritis FLS via the 
activation of caspase cascade and this process may be mediated by NF-κB 
signaling pathway. It was suggested that TCDCA may be a potential therapeutic 
agent for rheumatoid arthritis.
