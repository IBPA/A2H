Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) is a complex model of autoimmune-mediated 
arthritis that is regulated by multiple genetic and environmental factors. CIA 
is induced in rats by immunization with native type II collagen and develops 
joint pathology similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis. This chapter details 
methods for the extraction and purification of native type II collagen from 
sternal and articular cartilage, an arthritis induction protocol that has 
resulted in reproducible CIA expression in several rat strains from year to year 
and criteria for measuring clinical, radiographic and immunological outcome 
parameters characteristic of CIA.
