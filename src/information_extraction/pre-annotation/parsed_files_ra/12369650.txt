OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of TNF blocking therapy on synovial immune 
activity in rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) by measuring mRNA expression of key 
macrophage and T cell cytokines during PEG sTNF-RI treatment (10mg/kg) on days 
8, 10 and 12.
METHODS: Paw volume was assessed every 3-4 days. Ankles were removed for 
quantitative radiology and histology and synovial membrane removed to determine 
cytokine mRNA expression using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. T cells in joints were 
quantified by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Paw volume was significantly decreased in rats treated with PEG STNF-RI 
from days 12 to 17. Histology scores and synovial T cell numbers were reduced on 
days 13 and 17 and radiology scores significantly reduced on day 13. Expression 
of synovial TNF, IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA was unchanged in treated 
rats and TGF-beta expression was significantly increased at day 13.
CONCLUSIONS: PEG sTNF-RI attenuates AA and disease recurs after treatment 
ceases, similar to human rheumatoid arthritis. Continued TNF production and/or 
ongoing T cell activity, may explain the recrudescence of disease once treatment 
is stopped.
