OBJECTIVE: To exploit the physiologic Fcgamma receptor IIb (CD32B) inhibitory 
coupling mechanism to control B cell activation by constructing a novel 
bispecific diabody scaffold, termed a dual-affinity retargeting (DART) molecule, 
for therapeutic applications.
METHODS: DART molecules were constructed by pairing an Fv region from a 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD32B with an Fv region from a mAb 
directed against CD79B, the beta-chain of the invariant signal-transducing dimer 
of the B cell receptor complex. DART molecules were characterized 
physicochemically and for their ability to simultaneously bind the target 
receptors in vitro and in intact cells. The ability of the DART molecules to 
negatively control B cell activation was determined by calcium mobilization, by 
tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules, and by proliferation and Ig 
secretion assays. A DART molecule specific for the mouse ortholog of CD32B and 
CD79B was also constructed and tested for its ability to inhibit B cell 
proliferation in vitro and to control disease severity in a collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) model.
RESULTS: DART molecules were able to specifically bind and coligate their target 
molecules on the surface of B cells and demonstrated a preferential simultaneous 
binding to both receptors on the same cell. DART molecules triggered the 
CD32B-mediated inhibitory signaling pathway in activated B cells, which 
translated into inhibition of B cell proliferation and Ig secretion. A DART 
molecule directed against the mouse orthologs was effective in inhibiting the 
development of CIA in DBA/1 mice.
CONCLUSION: This innovative bispecific antibody scaffold that simultaneously 
engages activating and inhibitory receptors enables novel therapeutic approaches 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and potentially other autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases in humans.
