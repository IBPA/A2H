Receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-independent 
osteoclastogenic pathway was reported recently. MicroRNA (miR)-124 has been 
known to suppress RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting NFATc1 
expression. However, whether miR-124 regulates a RANKL-independent pathway has 
not been elucidated. In this study, we examined whether a RANKL-independent 
pathway is regulated by miR-124 in addition to the RANKL-dependent one. Using 
osteoclastogenic culture and pit-formation assay, we found that a miR-124 mimic 
inhibited osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated 
by TNF-α, IL-6, and M-CSF in the presence of osteoprotegerin. We also showed 
that the expression levels of osteoclast-specific genes and NFATc1 protein were 
suppressed in the miR-124 mimic-transfected cells by performing 
quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Our results 
indicate that miR-124 is important in inhibiting both RANKL-dependent and 
-independent osteoclast differentiation by suppressing NFATc1-mediated pathway.
