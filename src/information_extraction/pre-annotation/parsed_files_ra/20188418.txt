We previously constructed two Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE)-based immunotoxins, 
IL15-PEDelta293 (IT1) and IL15M-PEDelta293 (IT2), for eliminating interleukin-15 
receptor (IL-15R)-overexpressing cells. These two immunotoxins were generated by 
fusing either wild-type human IL-15 or an antagonist mutant IL-15 (IL-15M) to a 
modified form of PE. In this study the anti-arthritic effect of IT1 and IT2 was 
investigated using the rat model of adjuvant arthritis (AA). We found that both 
IT1 and IT2 could specifically target IL-15R-positive cells and induce 
apoptosis. After AA induction, treatment with either IT1 or IT2 resulted in 
profound improvement of the disease, with reductions in levels of synovial 
mononuclear leukocytes and certain inflammatory factors. Clinical and 
histological comparisons, together with the analyses of mRNA expression and the 
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) phosphorylation, 
revealed that the two immunotoxins decreased joint inflammation in AA rats to a 
similar extent. These data suggest that eliminating IL-15R-bearing cells via 
immunotoxins may be a promising approach for RA treatment. In addition, 
wild-type IL-15-based immunotoxins can be as effective as antagonist mutant 
IL-15-based immunotoxins in preventing joint inflammation associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis.
