A subset of murine T lymphocytes sharing receptor structures with natural killer 
cells, named natural killer T cells, has characteristics distinct from 
conventional T cells and natural killer cells. The DBA/1 strain commonly used 
for collagen-induced arthritis induction does not express the natural killer 1.1 
molecule, a marker for defining murine natural killer T cells. Therefore, 
collagen-induced arthritis was induced in the C57BL/6 strain carrying natural 
killer 1.1 marker and the role of natural killer T cells was examined in this 
model. The collagen-induced arthritis was induced successfully in the C57/BL6 
strain with near 70% incidence. Lower percentages of natural killer T cells in 
lymphoid organs including spleen and lymph node and higher percentages of 
natural killer T cells in synovium were found in mice with severe inflamed 
joints as compared with those with mild inflamed joints. The results suggested 
an infiltration of natural killer 1.1+ CD3+ natural killer T cells into inflamed 
synovium in the model of collagen-induced arthritis. Although the preliminary 
results of natural killer 1.1 monoclonal antibody depletion experiments failed 
to alleviate the gravity of arthritis, such a C57BL/6 mouse model of 
collagen-induced arthritis may provide a tool in the study of therapeutic 
manipulation of natural killerT cells in human autoimmune diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis.
