Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multi-factorial disease characterized by chronic 
inflammation and destruction of multiple joints. To date, various biologic 
treatments for RA such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies have been 
developed; however, mechanisms underlying RA development remain unclear and 
targeted therapy for this condition has not been established. Here, we provide 
evidence that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) 
promotes inflammation and joint erosion in a mouse model of arthritis. Stat3 
global KO mice show early embryonic lethality; thus, we generated viable Stat3 
conditional knockout adult mice and found that they were significantly resistant 
to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), the most common RA model, compared with 
controls. We then used an in vitro culture system to screen ninety-six existing 
drugs to select Stat3 inhibitors and selected five candidate inhibitors. Among 
them, three significantly inhibited development of arthritis and joint erosion 
in CIA wild-type mice. These findings suggest that Stat3 inhibitors may serve as 
promising drugs for RA therapy.
