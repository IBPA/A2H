Methotrexate is a widely used drug in treatments of various types of 
malignancies and in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. The goal of our study 
was to look at the effect of this dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor on the actin 
cytoskeleton, since actin plays an important role in cancer transformation and 
metastasis. For this reason we compared results obtained from experiments on 
CaSki (human uterine cervix cancer) and NRK (normal fibroblastic rat kidney) 
cells treated with methotrexate. It has been shown previously that methotrexate 
can induce apoptosis. Therefore we first examined whether methotrexate induces 
apoptosis in our model cells. For this aim we applied several assays like 
Caspase Glo 3/7, DNA fragmentation and binding of phosphatidylserine by annexin 
V-fluorescein. The data obtained indicated that methotrexate induces programmed 
cell death in CaSki and NRK cells. However, differences between CaSki and NRK 
cells were observed in the morphological alterations and dynamics of apoptosis 
induced by methotrexate. It seemed that cancer cells were more sensitive towards 
the cell death inducing activity at lower concentrations of methotrexate. 
Analysis by confocal microscopy of methotrexate-treated cells demonstrated that 
treatment with this folate antagonist affected the actin cytoskeleton, although 
the dis-organization of the actin cytoskeleton after treatment with methotrexate 
differed between cancer and normal cells.
