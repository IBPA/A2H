Progranulin (PGRN), an autocrine growth factor, has multiple physiological 
functions and is widely involved in the pathogenesis of many types of diseases. 
The pivotal anti-inflammatory function of PGRN in rheumatoid arthritis 
encouraged us to examine the role of PGRN in acute kidney injury (AKI). We found 
that levels of PGRN were significantly reduced in the kidney in a mouse model of 
renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. We also observed that PGRN deficiency 
(Grn(-/-) mice) significantly aggravated renal injury as evidenced by higher 
serum creatinine, more severe morphological injury, increased tubular epithelial 
cell death, and tubulointerstitial neutrophil and macrophage infiltration versus 
wild-type mice. In vitro, we found that recombinant human PGRN attenuated 
hypoxia-induced inflammatory actions and apoptosis in proximal tubule epithelial 
cells, at least in part associated with a nucleotide-binding oligomerization 
domain containing 2 (NOD2)-mediated immune response. Importantly, pretreatment 
with or delayed administration of recombinant human PGRN protected against or 
promoted recovery from renal ischemia/reperfusion injury in wild-type and 
Grn(-/-) mice. Similar protective effects were also found in cisplatin-induced 
AKI. Thus, our findings provide a better understanding of the biological 
activities of PGRN in the kidney and suggest that PGRN may be an innovative 
therapeutic strategy for treating patients with AKI.
