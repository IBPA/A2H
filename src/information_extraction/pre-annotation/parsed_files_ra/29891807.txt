Peucedanum japonicum Thunberg is an herbal medicine used to treat neuralgia, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory-related diseases. However, its effects on 
osteoarthritis (OA) and its regulatory mechanisms have not been investigated by 
network analysis. Here, we investigated the pharmacological effects of 
Peucedanum japonicum extract (PJE) on OA, by combining in vivo effective 
verification and network pharmacology prediction. Rats in which OA was induced 
by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) were treated with PJE (200 mg/kg), and 
histopathological parameters, weight bearing distribution and inflammatory 
factors in serum and joint tissue were measured after 28 days of treatment. 
Additionally, in silico network analysis was used to predict holistic OA 
regulatory mechanisms of PJE. The results showed that PJE exerted potential 
protective effects by recovering hind paw weight bearing distribution, 
alleviating histopathological features of cartilage and inhibiting inflammatory 
mediator levels in the OA rat model. Furthermore, network analysis identified 
caspase-3 (CASP3), caspase-7 (CASP7), and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) as 
potential target genes; in addition, the TNF (Tumor necrosis factor) signaling 
pathway was linked to OA therapeutic action. Our combined animal OA model and 
network analysis confirmed the therapeutic effects of PJE against OA and 
identified intracellular signaling pathways, active compounds and target genes 
linked to its therapeutic action.
