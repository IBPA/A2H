OBJECTIVE: Joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a result of 
degradation and invasion of the articular cartilage by the pannus tissue. The 
present study was undertaken to examine the role of the plasminogen activation 
system in cartilage degradation and invasion by synovial fibroblasts and 
investigate a novel gene therapeutic approach using a cell surface-targeted 
plasmin inhibitor (ATF.BPTI).
METHODS: Adenoviral vectors were used for gene transfer. The effects of ATF.BPTI 
gene transfer on RA synovial fibroblast-dependent cartilage degradation were 
studied in vitro, and cartilage invasion was studied in vivo in the SCID mouse 
coimplantation model.
RESULTS: The results indicate that cartilage matrix degradation by rheumatoid 
synovial fibroblasts is plasmin mediated and depends on urokinase-type 
plasminogen activator for activation. Targeting plasmin inhibition to the cell 
surface of the fibroblasts by gene transfer of a cell surface-binding plasmin 
inhibitor resulted in a significant reduction of cartilage matrix degradation in 
vitro and of cartilage invasion in vivo. Compared with uninfected rheumatoid 
synovial fibroblasts, the mean +/-SEM cartilage degradation in vitro was reduced 
to 87.9+/-0.9% after LacZ gene transfer versus a reduction to 24.0+/-1.6% after 
ATF.BPTI gene transfer (P<0.0001). The mean +/- SEM in vivo cartilage invasion 
score was 3.1+/-0.4 in the control-transduced fibroblasts and 1.8+/-0.4 in the 
ATF.BPTI-transduced fibroblasts (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate a role of the plasminogen activation system 
in synovial fibroblast-dependent cartilage degradation and invasion in RA, and 
demonstrate an effective way to inhibit this by gene transfer of a cell 
surface-targeted plasmin inhibitor.
