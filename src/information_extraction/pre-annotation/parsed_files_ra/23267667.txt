1. Aconitine (AC), an active and highly toxic constituent extracted from 
aconitum plants, is well known for its excellent effects against rheumatism and 
rheumatoid arthritis. The metabolism of AC in liver and intestine has been 
previously reported. However, little is known about the metabolism of AC in 
stomach. In this study, the metabolite profiling of AC in stomachs of rabbit and 
rat was performed by liquid chromatography/electrospray 
ionization/multiple-stage tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS(n)), for the first 
time. 2. The samples were purified by liquid-liquid extraction, separated using 
an Agilent extended C18 column following a linear gradient elution and then 
detected by ESI/MS(n) in positive ion mode. Metabolites were identified by 
comparing their protonated molecules, fragmentation patterns and chromatographic 
behaviors with those of standard compounds and data from authorized literature 
works. 3. In conclusion, 14 metabolites were identified in animal stomach after 
oral administration of AC. The presentation of a large amount of metabolites of 
AC in stomach suggested that, for aconitum alkaloids, the stomach might play an 
important role in their metabolism.
