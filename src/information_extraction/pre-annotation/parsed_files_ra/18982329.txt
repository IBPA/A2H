Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) has been widely used as the animal model of 
rheumatoid arthritis since 1977, while till now, no paper has depicted the 
destruction characteristics in different foot joints. In this study, we observed 
the differences among the foot joint destruction process of CIA to elucidate 
further the pathological process of this model. CIA was induced in male Wistar 
rat immunized with bovine type II collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. 
Radiological studies were performed 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after the second 
immunization to follow the development of disease. At last, all the animals were 
killed and histological research was performed. In the histological observation, 
three main types of joint destructions such as subchondral side erosion, 
external joint erosion and the cartilaginous fusion of articular cartilage were 
identified. All these destruction forms exist in one joint or several different 
joints. Furthermore, we found that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 
stain-positive cells participated in the destruction of articular cartilage. 
These new findings showed that in the disease process of the CIA model, 
different foot joints show different destruction characteristics and 
cartilaginous fusion of foot joints is another typical pathological 
characteristic.
