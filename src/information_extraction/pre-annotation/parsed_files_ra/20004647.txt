Neutrophils and monocytes are abundantly represented in the synovial fluid and 
tissue in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We therefore explored the effects of 
small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists to block migration of these cells 
in anti-collagen antibody-induced arthritis. Targeting neutrophil migration with 
the CXCR2/CXCR1 antagonist SCH563705 led to a dose-dependent decrease in 
clinical disease scores and paw thickness measurements and clearly reduced 
inflammation and bone and cartilage degradation based on histopathology and paw 
cytokine analyses. In contrast, targeting monocyte migration with the CCR2 
antagonist MK0812 had no effect on arthritis disease severity. The 
pharmacodynamic activities of both SCH563705 and MK0812 were verified by 
assessing their effects on the peripheral blood monocyte and neutrophil 
populations. SCH563705 selectively reduced the peripheral blood neutrophil 
frequency, and caused an elevation in the CXCR2 ligand CXCL1. MK0812 selectively 
reduced the peripheral blood monocyte frequency, and caused an elevation in the 
CCR2 ligand CCL2. The much greater impact of CXCR2/CXCR1 antagonism relative to 
CCR2 antagonism in this model of arthritis highlights the therapeutic potential 
for targeting CXCR2/CXCR1 in human arthritides.
