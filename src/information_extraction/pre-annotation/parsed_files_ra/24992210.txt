Specific delivery of TNF-α antagonist to the inflamed site can increase its 
efficacy and reduce the side effects. In this study, we constructed a bispecific 
diabody (BsDb) that targets TNF-α and ED-B-containing fibronectin (B-FN), a 
fibronectin isoform specifically expressed in the pannus of the inflamed joint 
in rheumatoid arthritis. BsDb was produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion 
bodies, purified to homogeneity, and refolded to the functional form. Our data 
demonstrate that BsDb could simultaneously bind to human TNF-α and B-FN and 
neutralize TNF-α action. In the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, we 
compared the biodistrubtion and therapeutic efficacy of BsDb with those of the 
anti-TNF-α scFv (TNF-scFv). Similar to TNF-scFv, BsDb penetrated into the 
synovial tissue quickly, showing a rapid clearance from blood and normal organs. 
In contrast, BsDb could selectively accumulate and retain in arthritic joints of 
mice for a long period time, resulting in a much stronger inhibition of 
arthritis progression in mice than TNF-scFv. The findings described herein 
indicate that BsDb has a good specificity to the inflamed joint, with low 
toxicity to normal organs and seems to be an ideal biological agent for the 
treatment of RA and other chronic inflammatory disease.
