The proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 mediates IFN-gamma production as well as the 
induction of Th1 polarized immune responses in synergy with IL-12. In this 
study, we describe the production of isogeneic monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) 
directed against murine IL-18 (mIL-18). Immunization of IL-18-deficient mice 
with recombinant mIL-18 in the presence of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) 
and alum as adjuvant resulted in high anti-IL-18 serum titers. We could identify 
two Mabs, SK721-2 and SK113AE-4, which were able to bind to IL-18 and neutralize 
its IFN-gamma inducing effect in vitro with an IC(50) of 40-100 ng/ml. In vivo, 
LPS-induced IFN-gamma production was reduced by 60-85% following a single 
administration of Mabs SK113AE-4 or SK721-2. Since IL-18 is likely to be 
involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis or Crohn's disease, neutralizing mouse anti-mouse IL-18 Mabs have the 
potential to become valuable tools for the therapeutic exploration of long-term 
IL-18 blockade in vivo.
