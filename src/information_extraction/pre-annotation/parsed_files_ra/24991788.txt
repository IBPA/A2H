Esculentic acid (EA), a pentacyclic triterpenoids compound extracted from the 
Chinese herb Phytolacca esculenta, has long been used in traditional Chinese 
medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, edema, hepatitis and 
bronchitis disease. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory 
effect of EA in vivo and in vitro and the effect of EA on cyclooxygenase (COX) 
protein expression. To gain insight into the anti-inflammatory effect of EA both 
in vivo and in vitro and its effect on COX-2 expression, we used animal 
inflammatory models and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse peritoneal 
macrophages to examine the anti-inflammatory action of EA. Our findings 
demonstrated that EA possessed potent anti-inflammatory activity both in vivo 
and in vitro, while the anti-inflammation action in vitro may be attributed to 
the inhibition of the level of TNF-Î± and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
PGE2 inflammatory mediator in macrophages. Meanwhile, the production of PGE2 was 
possibly associated with COX-2 protein expression which was similar to that of 
NSAIDS. The study extends our understanding of the anti-inflammatory effect of 
EA both in vivo and in vitro and provides clarification of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the effect of EA on PGE2 production, extending a novel 
aspect to the pharmacological activity of EA.
