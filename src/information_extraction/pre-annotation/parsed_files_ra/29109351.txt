The aim of this study was to investigate osteoclastogenic properties of 
inflammatory cytokines at different time-points of osteoclastogenesis. Bone 
marrow-derived macrophages from five healthy dogs were stimulated with the 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB 
ligand and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α and IL-17. Osteoclasts (OC) formation and function were enhanced 
with TNF-α regardless of temporal differences. But in contrast, IL-1β suppressed 
the osteoclastogenesis at early phase of the process while upregulating at the 
late phase. Furthermore, differentiation of OC precursors into OC was suppressed 
at high concentrations of IL-17. Collectively, the results revealed that 
suppressing TNF-α would be a promising strategy to inhibit 
inflammation-associated bone destruction in dogs.
