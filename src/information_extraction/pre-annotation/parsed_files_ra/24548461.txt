Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) plays a pivotal role in chronic inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Although anti-TNF 
antibody therapy is now commonly used to treat patients suffering from these 
inflammatory conditions, the cost of treatment continues to be a concern. Here, 
we developed a rice transgenic system for the production of a llama variable 
domain of a heavy-chain antibody fragment (VHH) specific for mouse TNF in rice 
seeds (MucoRice-mTNF-VHH). MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was produced at high levels in the 
rice seeds when we used our most recent transgene-overexpression system with RNA 
interference technology that suppresses the production of major rice endogenous 
storage proteins while enhancing the expression of the transgene-derived 
protein. Production levels of mTNF-VHH in rice seeds reached an average of 1.45% 
(w/w). Further, approximately 91% of mTNF-VHH was released easily when the 
powder form of MucoRice-mTNF-VHH was mixed with PBS. mTNF-VHH purified by means 
of single-step gel filtration from rice PBS extract showed high neutralizing 
activity in an in vitro mTNF cytotoxicity assay using WEHI164 cells. In 
addition, purified mTNF-VHH suppressed progression of collagen-induced arthritis 
in mice. These results show that this rice-expression system is useful for the 
production of neutralizing VHH antibody specific for mTNF.
