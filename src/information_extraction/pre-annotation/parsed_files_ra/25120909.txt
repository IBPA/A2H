Glucocorticoids are effective drugs used for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or asthma. Furthermore, they regulate 
various physiological processes, including bone remodeling. However, long-term 
high- and even low-dose glucocorticoid use is associated with a compromised bone 
quality and an increased fracture risk. At the cellular level, glucocorticoids 
suppress bone formation and stimulate bone resorption, which leads to loss of 
bone mass. To investigate the underlying mechanisms and new therapeutic 
strategies, the in vivo model for glucocorticoid-induced bone loss is widely 
used. This protocol outlines the common procedure that is currently used for the 
induction of bone loss in mice using glucocorticoids. It further provides useful 
hints and highlights possible pitfalls to take into account before starting an 
experiment.
