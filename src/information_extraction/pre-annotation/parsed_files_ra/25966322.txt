BACKGROUND: The plant Arnica montana is used in folk medicine to alleviate pain, 
inflammation and swelling of muscles and joints associated with rheumatoid 
arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. The present study aimed to 
investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of A. montana flower 
methanol extract (AMME) against both inflammation and oxidative stress in a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.
RESULTS: Oral administration of AMME was found to reduce clinical signs and 
improve the histological and radiological status of the hind limb joints. 
AMME-treated rats had lower expression levels of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis 
factor-α, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12) and titer of anti-type II 
collagen antibody compared with untreated CIA rats. Furthermore, by inhibiting 
these mediators, AMME also contributed towards the reversal of disturbed 
antioxidant levels and peroxidative damage.
CONCLUSION: The alleviation of arthritis in rats was very likely due to the 
combined action of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, the major constituents 
identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The study 
also shed some light on mechanisms involved in diminution of inflammatory 
mediators and free radical-generating toxicants and enhancement of the 
antioxidant armory, thereby preventing further tissue damage, injury and 
synovial hyperproliferation in arthritis.
