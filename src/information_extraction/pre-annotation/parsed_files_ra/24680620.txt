The seeds of Vitex negundo L. (Verbenaceae) have been commonly used as a folk 
remedy for the treatment of rheumatism and joint inflammation in Traditional 
Chinese Medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of 
the extract of V. negundo seeds (EVNS) using Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) 
induced arthritis (AA) in rat model. As a result, EVNS, with abundant 
phenylnaphthalene-type lignans, significantly inhibited the paw edema, decreased 
the arthritis score and spleen index, and reversed the weight loss of 
CFA-injected rats. Histopathological studies showed a marked decrease of 
synovial inflammatory infiltration and synovial lining hyperplasia in the joints 
of EVNS-treated animals. The remarkable decrement of serum inflammatory factors 
(TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were observed in EVNS-treated rats, whereas, IL-10, an 
anti-inflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly increased by EVNS. The 
expressions of COX-2 and 5-LOX in PBMC were also inhibited by administration of 
EVNS. Our results demonstrated that V. negundo seeds possessed potential 
therapeutic effect on adjuvant induced arthritis in rats by decreasing the 
levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and increasing that of IL-10 in serum as well as 
down-regulating the levels of COX-2 and 5-LOX, and therefore may be an effective 
cure for the treatment of human rheumatoid arthritis.
