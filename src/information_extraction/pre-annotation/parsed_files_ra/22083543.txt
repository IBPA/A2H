OBJECTIVE: Integrin α2β1 functions as a major receptor for type I collagen on 
different cell types, including fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. Although in 
vitro data suggest a role for α2β1 integrin in regulating both cell attachment 
and expression of matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs), mice that lack the α2 integrin subunit (Itga2(-/-) mice) develop 
normally and are fertile. We undertook this study to investigate the effect of 
Itga2 deficiency in 2 different mouse models of destructive arthritis: the 
antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) mouse model and the human tumor necrosis factor 
α (TNFα)-transgenic mouse model.
METHODS: AIA was induced in the knee joints of Itga2(-/-) mice and wild-type 
controls. Human TNF-transgenic mice were crossed with Itga2(-/-) mice and were 
assessed clinically and histopathologically for signs of arthritis, 
inflammation, bone erosion, and cartilage damage. MMP expression, proliferation, 
fibroblast attachment, and ERK activation were determined.
RESULTS: Under arthritic conditions, Itga2 deficiency led to decreased severity 
of joint pathology. Specifically, Itga2(-/-) mice showed less severe clinical 
symptoms and dramatically reduced pannus formation and cartilage erosion. Mice 
lacking α2β1 integrin exhibited reduced MMP-3 expression, both in their sera and 
in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), due to impaired ERK activation. Further, 
both the proliferation and attachment of FLS to cartilage were partially 
dependent on α2β1 integrin in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that α2β1 integrin contributes significantly to 
inflammatory cartilage destruction by promoting fibroblast proliferation and 
attachment and MMP expression.
