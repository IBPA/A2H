Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (JAK3) is expressed in lymphoid cells and is involved in 
the signalling of T cell functions. The development of a selective JAK3 
inhibitor has been shown to have a potential benefit in the treatment of 
autoimmune disorders. In this article, we developed the 4-aminopiperidine-based 
compound RB1, which was highly selective for JAK3 inhibition, with an IC50 of 
value of 40 nM, but did not inhibit JAK1, JAK2 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) at 
concentrations up to 5 µM. Furthermore, RB1 also exhibited favourable 
selectivity against a panel of representative kinases. In a battery of 
cytokine-stimulated cell-based assays, this potent inhibitor of JAK3 activity 
with good selectivity against other kinases could potently inhibit JAK3 activity 
over the activity of JAK1 or JAK2 (over at least 100-fold). A combination of 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiments validated that RB1 
covalently modified the unique cysteine 909 residue in JAK3. In vivo, RB1 
exerted significantly improved pathology in the joints of a collagen-induced 
arthritis mouse model. The reasonable pharmacokinetics properties (F = 72.52%, 
T1/2 = 14.6 h) and favourable results of toxicology experiments (LD50 > 2 g/kg) 
suggest that RB1 has the potential to be an efficacious treatment for RA.
