BACKGROUND: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is critical for activation of B cells 
and myeloid cells. This study aimed to characterize the effects of HM71224, a 
novel Btk inhibitor, both in vitro and in a mouse model of experimental 
arthritis.
METHODS: The kinase inhibition profile of HM71224 was analyzed. The in vitro 
effects of HM71224 on B cells and monocytes were analyzed by examining 
phosphorylation of Btk and its downstream signaling molecules, along with 
cytokine production and osteoclast formation. The in vivo effects of HM71224 
were investigated in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
RESULTS: HM71224 irreversibly bound to and inhibited Btk (IC50 = 1.95 nM). The 
compound also inhibited the phosphorylation of Btk and its downstream molecules 
such as PLCγ2, in activated Ramos B lymphoma cells and primary human B cells in 
a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HM71224 effectively inhibited the 
production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β by 
human monocytes, and osteoclast formation by human monocytes. Finally, HM71224 
improved experimental arthritis and prevented joint destruction in a murine 
model of CIA.
CONCLUSIONS: HM71224 inhibits Btk in B cells and monocytes and ameliorates 
experimental arthritis in a mouse model. Thus, HM71224 is a potential novel 
therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis in humans.
