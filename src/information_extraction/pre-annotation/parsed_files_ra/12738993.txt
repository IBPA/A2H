Arsenic compounds have been used to treat angiogenic diseases such as cancer, 
psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis in traditional oriental medicine. In recent 
years, arsenic trioxide (As2O3, diarsenic oxide) has been successfully used to 
treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. We investigated the antiangiogenic 
properties of tetraarsenic oxide (As4O6), another trivalent arsenic compound. In 
in vitro studies, tetraarsenic oxide inhibited the proliferation (IC50 = 99.7 
nM), migration into the denuded area (IC50 = 27.4 nM), and invasion through a 
layer of Matrigel (IC50 = 73.5 nM) of basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF)-stimulated bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells in a dose-dependent 
manner. Tetraarsenic oxide also inhibited the tube formation of human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells. Tetraarsenic oxide induced cell cycle arrest of 
bFGF-stimulated BCE cells in the G2/M phase and inhibited the secretion of 
matrix metalloproteinase-2 from BCE cells. Orally administered tetraarsenic 
oxide (50 mg/kg/day) inhibited bFGF-induced new-vessel formation in a rat 
corneal micropocket assay, and reduced by about 54% the number of experimental 
pulmonary metastatic nodules in mice implanted with B16F10 melanoma cells. Thus, 
we provide evidence that tetraarsenic oxide has effective antiangiogenic 
activities.
