Rheumatoid arthritis in humans brings about impaired insulin sensitivity and 
glucose tolerance. Since adipose tissue plays a role in glucose homeostasis, we 
evaluated the size of adipocytes, the amount of glucose transporter type 4 
(GLUT4) in adipocyte plasma membranes, and circulating insulin, glucose, and 
adipokines affecting glucose metabolism, resistin, adiponectin and visfatin 
during experimental adjuvant arthritis (AA) in male Lewis rats. AA was induced 
by a single injection of complete Freund's adjuvans. Adipocyte diameter was 
assessed microscopically, GLUT4 was measured by Western blotting. Plasma 
insulin, adiponectin, visfatin were quantitated by RIA, and resistin by ELISA. 
Arthritic rats showed cachexia, reduced adipocyte size, and downregulated 
membrane GLUT4 (4065 +/- 962 vs. 9911 +/- 680 arb. units of optic density, p < 
0.01), reduced plasma adiponectin (1.956 +/- 0.10 vs. 3.16 +/- 0.22 microg/ml, p 
< 0.001), and enhanced visfatin (1.84 +/- 1.05 vs. 1.24 +/- 0.1 ng/ml, p < 
0.01). Plasma glucose and insulin were unaltered, as were the resistin levels.
CONCLUSION: AA induced cachexia results in reduction of adipocyte size, and 
paradoxically also in downregulation of GLUT4 in adipocyte membranes. This is 
supposed to be functionally related to the reduced adiponectin levels. The 
upregulated visfatin in rat arthritis is a novel finding, and it confirms its 
role in autoimmunity across the species.
