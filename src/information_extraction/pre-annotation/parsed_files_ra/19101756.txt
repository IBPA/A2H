Synovial angiogenesis plays an important role in the inflammation in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key molecule in 
angiogenesis and binds to specific receptors, known as vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor I (VEGF RI). In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic efficacy of anti-VEGF RI antibody (Ab) on RA using a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Twelve DBA/1 mice were divided 
into three groups. All mice except controls were injected with type II collagen. 
Mice in the anti-VEGF-RI-Ab-treated groups were injected on one posterior paw 
with 50 microg anti-VEGF RI Ab twice weekly for 3 weeks. Arthritis score and paw 
thickness were measured and histopathologic assessment of joint sections was 
performed by hematoxylin-eosin. The infiltration of CD45+ inflammatory cells and 
neovascularization were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Anti-VEGF RI 
Ab significantly attenuated the arthritis severity and histopathologic findings 
in the CIA mice model. The infiltration of CD45+ cells decreased in 
anti-VEGF-RI-Ab-treated joint tissues. Staining for CD31 revealed reduced 
synovial neovascularization after anti-VEGF RI Ab treatment. The data showing 
that in vivo administration of anti-VEGF RI Ab suppressed arthritis in 
established CIA mice suggest anti-VEGF RI Ab treatment may serve as a new 
therapeutic modality for RA.
