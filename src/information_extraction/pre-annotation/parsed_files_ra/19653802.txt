Phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase is the key enzyme in the sulfoxidation of the 
thioether drug S-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine and its thioether metabolites, 
S-methyl-l-cysteine, N-acetyl-S-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine and 
N-acetyl-S-methyl-l-cysteine in humans, and a number of other mammalian species. 
The kinetics constants of the sulfoxidation reaction (K(m), V(max) and CL(E)) 
have been investigated in cytosolic fractions derived from rat and human liver, 
in cytosolic fractions of HepG2 cells and using both human and mouse cDNA 
expressed phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase. Differences in K(m), V(max) and CL(E) 
of S-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine have been seen in HepG2 cells and human and mouse 
cDNA expressed phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase when compared to both rat and human 
hepatic cytosolic fractions. The association of the genetic polymorphism in the 
sulfoxidation of S-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine is highlighted with particular 
reference to this biotransformation reaction as being a biomarker of disease 
susceptibility in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and motor neurone diseases and in 
rheumatoid arthritis. The possible underlying molecular genetics of the 
sulfoxidation polymorphism is also discussed in relation to the known allelic 
frequencies of phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase. Finally, the new found role 
phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase plays in xenobiotic metabolism is discussed.
