Some inflammatory mediators play an important role not only in the pathogenesis 
of the inflammatory pain, but also in that of neuropathic and visceral pain. We 
previously showed the antihyperalgesic effect of oATP, the inhibitor of the P2X7 
receptors for the pro-nociceptive ATP, in experimental inflammation. Here we 
show the antihyperalgesic effect of oATP in mouse models of neuropathic and 
visceral pain, other than in a model of arthritic pain mimicking rheumatoid 
arthritis in humans. We also show that mice lacking P2X7 receptors (KO) are 
resistant to hyperalgesic thermal stimuli following the induction of arthritic, 
neuropathic and visceral pain. Local (injection into the right hind paw) 
pre-treatment with oATP is able to prevent the successive induction of 
ATP-dependent hyperalgesia in wild type mice. In addition, KO mice are not 
insensitive to intraplantar treatment with ATP. Our data suggest that, even if 
oATP is able to inhibit purinoceptors different from P2X7, the latter are the 
more important involved in pain transmission.
