Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by loss of 
proteoglycans (PGs) and their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains that are essential 
for cartilage function. Here, we investigated the role of glycosyltransferases 
(GTs) responsible for PG-GAG chain assembly during joint cartilage destruction 
and repair processes. At various times after antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and 
papain-induced cartilage repair in rats, PG synthesis and deposition, expression 
of GTs, and GAG chain composition were analyzed. Our data showed that expression 
of the GT xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) gene initiating PG-GAG chain synthesis was 
significantly reduced in AIA rat cartilage and was associated with a decrease in 
PG synthesis. Interestingly, interleukin-1beta, the main proinflammatory 
cytokine incriminated in joint diseases, down-regulated the XT-I gene expression 
with a concomitant decrease in PG synthesis in rat cartilage explants ex vivo. 
However, cartilage from papain-injected rat knees showed up-regulation of XT-I 
gene expression and increased PG synthesis at early stages of cartilage repair, 
a process associated with up-regulation of TGF-beta1 gene expression and 
mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Consistently, 
silencing of XT-I expression by intraarticular injection of XT-I shRNA in rat 
knees prevented cartilage repair by decreasing PG synthesis and content. These 
findings show that GTs play a key role in the loss of PG-GAGs in joint diseases 
and identify novel targets for stimulating cartilage repair.
