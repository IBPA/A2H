Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) is a member of the Immunoglobulin 
superfamily and encodes a cell surface sialoglycoprotein expressed in 
cytokine-activated endothelium. This type I membrane protein mediates 
leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, facilitates the downstream signaling, and 
may play a role in the development of artherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that VCAM1 exerts an anti-apoptotic 
effect in several tumor tissues such as ovarian cancer and breast cancer. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common subtype of stroke with 
high morbidity and mortality, which imposes a big burden on individuals and the 
whole society. These together prompted us to question whether VCAM1 has some 
association with neuron apoptosis during the pathological process of ICH. An ICH 
rat model was established and assessed by behavioral tests in order to explore 
the role of VCAM1 after ICH. Up-regulation of VCAM1 was observed in brain areas 
surrounding the hematoma following ICH by western blotting and 
immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence manifested VCAM1 was strikingly 
increased in neurons, but not in astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, we 
detected that neuronal apoptosis marker active caspase-3 had co-localizations 
with VCAM1. At the same time, Bcl-2 was also co-localized with VCAM1. Taken 
together, our findings suggested that VCAM1 might be involved in the neuronal 
apoptosis and pathophysiology of ICH.
