OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of oral scorpio and scolopendra powder on T-cell 
subsets in peripheral blood and intestine from rats with collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA).
METHOD: 60 rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group, model 
control group, low-dose scorpio and scolopendra group, middle-dose scorpio and 
scolopendra group, high-dose scorpio and scolopendra group, and type II collagen 
group. Rat's rheumatoid arthritis was induced by collagen II (C II). Level of 
T-cell subsets from peripheral blood and intestine was measured by flow 
cytometry.
RESULT: CD4+ T cellular level was obviously increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) or 
kept increased tendency in peripheral blood and intestine from the model group 
compared with that of the normal group, while the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in 
intestine was obviously descent but the contrary in peripheral blood (P < 0.05 
or P < 0.01). CD4+, CD8+ T cellular level in intestine were obviously descent 
and the ratio of CD4+ /CD8+ increased in all treated groups when compared with 
in the model group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, CD4+ T cellular level and 
the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in peripheral blood were remarkablely decreased.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism that scorpio and scolopendra could treat rat's 
rheumatoid arthritis may be regulating balance of T-lymphocyte subsets in 
peripheral blood and intestine.
