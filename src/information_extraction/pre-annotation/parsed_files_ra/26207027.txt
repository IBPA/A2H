Accumulating evidence points to the importance of the innate immune system in 
inflammation-induced bone loss in infectious and autoimmune diseases. TLRs are 
well known for being activated by ligands expressed by bacteria, viruses, and 
fungi. Recent findings indicate that also endogenous ligands in inflammatory 
processes are important, one being a TLR5 agonist present in synovial fluid from 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that activation of TLR5 by its 
specific ligand, flagellin, caused robust osteoclast formation and bone loss in 
cultured mouse neonatal parietal bones dependent on increased receptor activator 
of NF-κB ligand (RANKL):osteoprotegerin ratio, with half-maximal stimulation at 
0.01 μg/ml. Flagellin enhanced Rankl mRNA in isolated osteoblasts by a myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 and NF-κB-dependent mechanism. 
Injection of flagellin locally over skull bones in 5-wk-old mice resulted in 
increased mRNA expression of Rankl and osteoclastic genes, robust osteoclast 
formation, and bone loss. The effects in vitro and in vivo were absent in 
Tlr5(-/-) mice. These data show that TLR5 is a novel activator of RANKL and 
osteoclast formation and, therefore, a potential key factor in 
inflammation-induced bone erosions in diseases like RA, reactive arthritis, and 
periodontitis. TLR5 might be a promising novel treatment target for prevention 
of inflammatory bone loss.
