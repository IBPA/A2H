Interleukin 6 is an immune regulatory cytokine that impacts the development and 
maturation of T-cell, B-cell, and antibody producing plasma cells. A monoclonal 
antibody to the IL-6R (TocilizumabÂ®) was recently approved by the FDA for 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although anti-IL-6R anitbodies can reduce 
autoantibody levels in human disease, the use of anti-IL-6R for alloantibody 
suppression has not been examined. Here, we report on our experience with a 
mousenized rat-anti-mouse IL-6R (mMR16-1) for attenuating donor-specific 
antibody (DSA) responses. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with skin allografts from 
a HLA.A2 transgenic mouse, and treated with intraperitoneal injections of 
mMR16-1 or control antibody. DSA responses were monitored weekly for 5weeks by 
measurement of serum anti-HLA.A2 antibodies in a flow cytometric antibody 
binding assay. Results show that mMR16-1 significantly reduced DSA IgM, IgG2a 
and IgG1 responses, respectively, while normalizing serum amyloid A (SAA), an 
acute phase reactant induced by IL-6 (p<0.01 vs. control). mMR16-1 injections 
increased mononuclear cell apoptosis in the spleens, as detected by annexin V 
staining and TUNEL. In conclusion, anti-IL6R attenuates de novo DSA responses 
and suppresses inflammatory markers (SAA). The data indicate that antibody 
therapy targeting the IL-6/IL-6R pathway may serve as a strategy to suppress DSA 
generation.
