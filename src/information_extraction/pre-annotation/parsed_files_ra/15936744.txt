Identifying genes that regulate polygenic diseases influenced by the environment 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has so far proven to be difficult. By using 
an alternative approach, i.e., linkage analysis using relevant animal models we 
succeeded in finding the Ncf1 gene residing in the Pia4 quantitative trait locus 
to be responsible for the severity of pristane induced arthritis in rats. The 
influence of another mutation in the mouse Ncf1 gene showed the same association 
between decreased oxidative burst and enhanced arthritis. In this case the 
mutation affected a splice site giving a non-detectable oxidative burst response 
and enhanced collagen induced arthritis as well as myelin oligodendrocyte 
protein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings open 
up new possibilities for new treatments for autoimmune diseases, i.e., RA, 
targeting the NADPH oxidase pathway.
