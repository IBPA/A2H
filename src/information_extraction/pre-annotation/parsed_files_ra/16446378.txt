Prostaglandin (PG)I2 (prostacyclin [PGI]) and PGE2 are abundantly present in the 
synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Although the role of PGE2 
in RA has been well studied, how much PGI2 contributes to RA is little known. To 
examine this issue, we backcrossed mice lacking the PGI receptor (IP) to the 
DBA/1J strain and subjected them to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
IP-deficient (IP-/-) mice exhibited significant reduction in arthritic scores 
compared with wild-type (WT) mice, despite anti-collagen antibody production and 
complement activation similar to WT mice. IP-/- mice also showed significant 
reduction in contents of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 
in arthritic paws. Consistently, the addition of an IP agonist to cultured 
synovial fibroblasts significantly enhanced IL-6 production and induced 
expression of other arthritis-related genes. On the other hand, loss or 
inhibition of each PGE receptor subtype alone did not affect elicitation of 
inflammation in CIA. However, a partial but significant suppression of CIA was 
achieved by the combined inhibition of EP2 and EP4. Our results show significant 
roles of both PGI2-IP and PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling in the development of CIA, and 
suggest that inhibition of PGE2 synthesis alone may not be sufficient for 
suppression of RA symptoms.
