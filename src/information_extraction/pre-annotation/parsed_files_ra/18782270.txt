Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a well studied mouse model of the human 
disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both CIA and RA are complex diseases affected 
by multiple genes as well as environmental factors. Identifying the genes that 
determine susceptibility to arthritis would give invaluable clues to the largely 
unknown aetiology of RA. In this study, we dissected a known locus, Cia6, as 
well as a genomic region on chromosome 14 with no previously known arthritis 
loci, using a partial advanced intercross and a collection of congenic strains. 
The chromosome 14 congenic fragment, containing the T-cell receptor alpha (Tcra) 
locus, was included based on the hypothesis that the Cia6 locus is caused by a 
polymorphism in the Tcr beta (Tcrb) locus and that the two loci interact. 
Splitting up the congenic fragments revealed multiple loci affecting arthritis 
traits as well as production of collagen-specific autoantibodies. In total seven 
new loci were identified of which four were in the previously unlinked 
chromosome 14 region. Both Tcr loci were within CIA loci making them candidate 
susceptibility genes. The results demonstrate the importance of breaking up 
genetic regions in smaller fragments to identify the underlying complex set of 
loci.
