Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a polygenic autoimmune disease. The autoimmunity 
develops from synergistic actions of genetic and environmental factors. We 
generated a double-mutant mouse by crossing two murine models of RA, a gp130 
mutant knock-in mouse (gp130F759/F759) and an HTLV-1 pX transgenic mouse 
(pX-Tg), in a C57BL/6 background, which is resistant to arthritis. The mice 
spontaneously developed severe arthritis with a much earlier onset than the 
gp130F759/F759 mice and with a much higher incidence than did the pX-Tg mice. 
The symptoms of gp130F759/F759 mice, including lymphoadenopathy, splenomegaly, 
hyper-gamma-globulinemia, autoantibody production, increases in memory/activated 
T cells and granulocytes in the peripheral lymphoid organs, and a decrease in 
the class II MHC(bright) CD11c+ population, were augmented in the double 
mutants. Marked reductions in incidence, severity and immunological 
abnormalities were seen in the triple mutant, IL-6-/-/gp130F759/F759/pX-Tg, 
indicating that the arthritis in the double mutant is IL-6 dependent. 
gp130F759/F759/pX-Tg is a unique mouse model for RA.
