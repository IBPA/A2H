CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells play a crucial role in maintaining 
self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune disease. The transcription factor 
forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) has been identified as a molecular marker for 
Treg cells. Foxp3 is highly expressed in lymphoid tissue and several signalling 
pathways influence its expression. It plays an essential role in the development 
and function of Treg cells. Mutations in Foxp3 are responsible for the scurfy 
(sf) mutant mouse, and for autoimmune human diseases including the X-linked 
fatal "immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked" (IPEX), 
autoimmune colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies have also revealed 
an important and novel anti-atherogenic role for Treg cells and consequently for 
Foxp3. These data open up potential novel therapeutic avenues for the management 
of atherosclerosis.
