OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effects of different processed products and 
extracts of Morinda officinalis root in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) 
model, and to explore the possible mechanism.
METHODS: AA model in SD rats was established, then the arthritic rats were 
randomly divided into seven groups such as model, Tripterygium Glycosides Tablet 
(TGT), morinda with xylem, morinda, salt-steamed morinda, licorice-processed 
morinda, morinda EtOAc extract, morinda n-BuOH extract, H₂O residue, total 
polysaccharides and control groups. The paw edema and arthritis indexes were 
observed, and the contents of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), IL-6, IL-2 and INF-γ in AA rats serum were detected by ELISA.
RESULTS: Morinda processed by salt and n-BuOH extract could reduce paw swelling 
and levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and INF-γ in AA rats serum, which followed by 
morinda EtOAc extract. The differences were significant compared with the model 
group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Salt-steamed morinda and morinda n-BuOH extract have the best 
curative effect, followed by morinda EtOAc extract. Reducing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 
and INF-γ contents in serum may be the mechanism of drug treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
