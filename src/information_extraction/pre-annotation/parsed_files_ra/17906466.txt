PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mesenchymal stem cells have the capacity to differentiate 
into several mesenchymal tissues, including the components of the hematopoietic 
stem cell niche. Mesenchymal stem cells also exhibit a powerful 
immunosuppressive activity. Here we review the most recent data to identify the 
properties of therapeutic significance.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mesenchymal stem cells are attractive not only in regenerative 
medicine but also for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host 
disease. Initial experience in animal models and the clinical setting have 
produced very encouraging results whereby mesenchymal stem cells have been shown 
to accelerate recovery after myocardial infarction, improve growth velocity in 
children with osteogenesis imperfecta, and ameliorate severe graft-versus-host 
disease as well as, in mouse models, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 
sclerosis. Their use in the clinical setting, however, must be considered with 
caution because there is evidence that mesenchymal stem cells may also 
contribute to the maintenance of cancer stem cells.
SUMMARY: The interest generated by mesenchymal stem cells has rapidly favored 
several initiatives to test their therapeutic potentials. There is still much to 
investigate to characterize their phenotype, understand their mechanisms of 
action, and optimize their in-vitro expansion for clinical use.
