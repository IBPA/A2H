Biqi capsule is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine formula that has been 
widely applied for the clinical treatment of such diseases as rheumatoid 
arthritis, scapulohumeral periarthritis and cervical spondylopathy. However, 
there is concern regarding the toxicity of Biqi capsule owing to its active 
ingredients, strychnine and brucine. To investigate the toxicokinetics of 
strychnine and brucine after oral administration of Biqi capsule to rats, a 
sensitive and simple rapid-resolution liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method was developed to determine the levels of strychnine and 
brucine in rat plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Capcell Pak 
C18 MG II (3.0 μm, 2.0 × 35 mm) column by gradient elution with acetonitrile and 
0.2% formic acid as the mobile phase. The method was validated over the range of 
0.25-250 ng/mL for strychnine and 0.025-25 ng/mL for brucine. The intra- and 
inter-day accuracies of strychnine and brucine in rat plasma were 100.3-106.6 
and 90.75-106.1% respectively, and the precisions were within 14.2%. The 
established method was successfully applied to the toxicokinetic study of 
strychnine and brucine after single and multiple oral administration of Biqi 
capsule to male and female rats at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg doses. The results 
showed different toxicokinetic characteristics in the different groups.
