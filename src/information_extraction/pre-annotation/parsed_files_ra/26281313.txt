BACKGROUND/AIM: Methotrexate (MTX) has been widely used for treatment of cancer 
and rheumatoid arthritis, but its use has been limited by its nephrotoxicity. 
This study was carried out to determine whether garlic exerts a protective 
effect against MTX-induced nephrotoxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nephrotoxicity was induced in rats after a single i.p. 
injection of MTX (20 mg/kg). Garlic extract (1 mL/100 g b.w.) was given orally 
for 7 days before and after MTX administration. Serum samples were collected to 
evaluate urea, creatinine, sodium, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium. Reduced 
glutathione, catalase, adenosine deaminase, nitric oxide, and malondialdehyde 
were measured in renal tissue. Tubular injury was evaluated by histopathological 
examination.
RESULTS: MTX increased urea and creatinine levels and led to imbalances in some 
electrolytes. It also depleted renal antioxidant enzyme levels and increased 
malondialdehyde, adenosine deaminase, and nitric oxide levels. Histopathological 
examination showed glomerular and tubular alterations. Pretreatment with garlic 
significantly improved renal function and increased renal antioxidant enzyme 
activities. Furthermore, garlic reduced renal oxidative stress and prevented 
alterations in renal morphology.
CONCLUSION: Garlic treatment has a reversible biochemical and histological 
effect upon MTX-induced nephrotoxicity.
