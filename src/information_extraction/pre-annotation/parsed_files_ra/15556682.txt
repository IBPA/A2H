In the last decade, CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells have been implicated in the 
protection against autoimmune diseases. The human DQ8 major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class II molecule is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
various other autoimmune diseases in humans. The human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-DQ8 transgenic mouse, containing the human DQ8 MHC class II molecule, is 
predisposed toward collagen-induced arthritis. However, the biologic pathways 
responsible for DQ8-associated autoimmunity have yet to be defined, including 
possible defects in the CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell compartment. To explore this 
concept, we examined the suppressive capacity of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells 
from DQ8 transgenic mice in vitro and, using CD25-specific depleting antibodies, 
investigated their influence on collagen-induced arthritis in vivo. CD4+CD25+ T 
regulatory cells isolated from DQ8 transgenic mice were found to be sufficient 
suppressors of splenocyte proliferation and interferon (INF)-gamma production. 
Furthermore, depletion of these cells before immunization led to significant 
increases in arthritis severity, collagen-specific antibodies, and INF-gamma 
production. These results indicate that HLA-DQ8 mice contain naturally occurring 
CD25+ regulatory cells that modulate collagen-induced arthritis and imply that 
DQ8 expression does not hinder the development of CD25+ T regulatory cells.
