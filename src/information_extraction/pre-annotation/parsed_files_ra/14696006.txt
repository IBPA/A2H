It is important to obtain high resolution images of joints for the study of 
disease, especially in rodent experimental models. We optimized (1)H magnetic 
resonance imaging three-dimensional sequences at 7 T, with lipid signal 
suppression, and T(1) and T(2) measurements for in-vivo experiments on rat 
joints, in order to assess the effectiveness of high-field MRI. The method was 
validated by applying it to the early diagnosis of arthritis. We studied the 
progress of rheumatoid arthritis in an arthritic rat model. We observed the 
rats' knees for 21 days after inducing arthritis. The images acquired over one 
hour had a high resolution of 1.75 x 10(-3) mm(3), (105 x 105 x 145 microm(3)) 
which allowed us to spot the early stages of joint degeneration, such as bone 
erosion, and to observe an apparent 'MRI' loss of cartilage thickness, 
attributed to dehydration of the cartilage tissue. The MR images obtained during 
the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis enabled us to study joint changes 
accurately before any histological signs of attack were visible.
