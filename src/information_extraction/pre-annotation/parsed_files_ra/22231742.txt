Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are amongst the most 
common autoimmune diseases in the northern hemisphere. There is mounting 
evidence that in both afflictions, not only environmental and genetic factors 
influence disease, but cellular components such as autoreactive T cells also 
contribute to pathology. Animal models are key in the study and subsequent 
therapeutic development for human autoimmune diseases. As patient material is 
often difficult to obtain and in some cases--as in MS, where the central nervous 
system (CNS) is concerned--even not accessible, animal models provide a 
multifaceted tool to explore disease-underlying mechanisms. The pro-inflammatory 
T cell cytokine IL-17 has recently moved to center stage due to its crucial role 
in autoimmune diseases including MS and RA. A plethora of studies in animal 
models has sustained the relevance of this cytokine pathway for the development 
of autoimmunity and shed light on its cellular sources and patho-mechanisms. 
This review addresses the role of IL-17 producing T lymphocytes, in particular 
CD4(+) and γδ T cells, in three commonly used mouse models for MS and RA, namely 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA), and antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Comparing and combining knowledge 
gained from different animal models will broaden our understanding of the IL-17 
biology and facilitate the translation to the human diseases.
