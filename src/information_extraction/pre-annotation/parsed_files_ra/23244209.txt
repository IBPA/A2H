BACKGROUND: Several studies have confirmed that galectin-1 (Gal-1) plays a role 
in controlling the immune response because of its pro-apoptotic effect. Although 
studies based on a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse model have suggested a 
crucial role for Gal-1 in inflammation, clinical data are lacking. We have 
detected the presence of autoantibodies against galectins in blood, but their 
physiological meaning remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To compare plasma and synovial levels of Gal-1 in RA patients and in 
healthy controls, and correlate them with clinical parameters.
METHODS: Plasma and synovial (non-arthritic knee effusion) samples were 
collected from RA patients and healthy donors. All patients were receiving 
treatment with steroids and/or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
A blood sample was taken at a baseline visit to determine plasma anti-cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, tumour necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α), Gal-1, and anti-Gal-1 autoantibodies.
RESULTS: Although plasma levels of Gal-1 were similar in patients and controls, 
the concentration of Gal-1 was significantly reduced in the synovial fluid of 
patients with RA. This reduction was not correlated with TNF-α or C-reactive 
protein (CRP) levels. However, the decrease in synovial Gal-1 correlated with a 
significant increase in anti-Gal-1 autoantibodies and anti-CCP antibody titres, 
suggesting a physiological effect of autoantibodies limiting the amount Gal-1 
and potentially blocking its biological effect in RA patients.
CONCLUSION: Gal-1 levels were significant reduced at the synovial level in RA 
patients, possibly as a consequence of the increase in anti-Gal-1 
autoantibodies.
