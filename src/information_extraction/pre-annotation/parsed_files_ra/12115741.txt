Proton efflux from chondrocytes alters the extracellular pH and ionic 
composition of cartilage, and influences the synthesis and degradation of 
extracellular matrix. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes chondrocyte 
proliferation during skeletal development and accumulates in the synovial fluid 
in rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect 
of EGF on proton efflux from chondrocytes. When monitored using a Cytosensor 
microphysiometer, EGF was found to rapidly activate proton efflux from CFK2 
chondrocytic cells and rat articular chondrocytes. The actions of EGF were 
concentration-dependent with half-maximal effects at 0.3-0.7 ng/ml. Partial 
desensitization and time-dependent recovery of the response were observed 
following repeated exposures to EGF. EGF-induced proton efflux was dependent on 
extracellular glucose, and inhibitors of Na(+)/H(+) exchange (NHE) markedly 
attenuated the initial increase in proton efflux. The response was diminished by 
inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase C, but not by 
inhibitors of MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) or protein kinase A or C. Thus, EGF-induced 
proton efflux involves glucose metabolism and NHE, and is regulated by a 
discrete subset of EGF-activated signaling pathways. In vivo, proton efflux 
induced by EGF may lead to an acidic environment, enhancing turnover of 
cartilage matrix during development and in rheumatoid arthritis.
