Since mice are widely used to establish rheumatoid arthritis models, assessment 
of the pathogenesis of local arthritis is fundamental. Proteins are the most 
diverse group of biologically important molecules and are essential for cellular 
structure and function. The first step in pathogenesis-related protein analysis 
is joint tissue extraction. Unlike other large rodents, obtaining synovium from 
model mice is challenging, since it is so small and fragile. In this chapter, 
methods for harvesting synovium through a quadriceps approach and preparing 
protein extracts are introduced.
