Paired Ig-like type 2 receptor (PILR)α inhibitory receptor and its counterpart 
PILRβ activating receptor are coexpressed on myeloid cells. In this article, we 
report that PILRα, but not PILRβ, is elevated in human rheumatoid arthritis 
synovial tissue and correlates with inflammatory cell infiltration. Pilrα(-/-) 
mice produce more pathogenic cytokines during inflammation and are prone to 
enhanced autoimmune arthritis. Correspondingly, engaging PILRα with anti-PILRα 
mAb ameliorates inflammation in mouse arthritis models and suppresses the 
production of proinflammatory cytokines. Our studies suggest that PILRα mediates 
an important inhibitory pathway that can dampen inflammatory responses.
