SCOPE: Morin, a flavonoid occurring in many dietary plants, can reduce the 
number of synovial blood vessels and ameliorate collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
in rats. Herein, its underlying mechanisms in view of the peroxisome 
proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) pathway are addressed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro, wound-healing and transwell assays are conducted 
to explore the effect of morin on HUVECs migration. Morin inhibits HUVECs 
migration and tube formation induced by VEGF, which is reversed by PPARγ 
antagonist GW9662 or siPPARγ. Molecular docking and competitive binding assays 
show that morin could bind to PPARγ. Morin increases the expression of PDK4 and 
CD36 in a PPARγ-dependent manner and increases the luciferase activity in cells 
transfected with PPARγ plasmid, which indicates that morin could activate PPARγ 
after binding. In addition, morin increases the expression of PTEN, a target 
gene of PPARγ that suppresses angiogenesis and inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling. The 
effects of morin on the PTEN-PI3K/Akt pathway are diminished by GW9662 and 
siPPARγ. In vivo studies show that morin ameliorates rat CIA, reduces synovial 
angiogenesis, and upregulates the expression of PTEN in the synovium, which is 
almost completely abolished by GW9662.
CONCLUSIONS: Morin is a potential agonist of PPARγ, which attenuates synovial 
angiogenesis and arthritis via the PPARγ-PTEN-PI3K/Akt pathway.
