OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of the novel CX3C chemokine fractalkine 
(Fkn) and its receptor (CX3CR1) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), a model of RA.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 
chemotaxis assays were used.
RESULTS: In rat AIA, synovial tissue (ST) macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial 
cells, and dendritic cells were Fkn immunopositive, whereas lymphocytes did not 
significantly express Fkn. Significant staining for CX3CR1 was found in ST 
macrophages, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells, whereas only a small percentage 
of endothelial cells stained for CX3CR1 in rat AIA. We immunolocalized Fkn to RA 
ST macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. We also 
found intense ST macrophage and dendritic cell staining for CX3CR1 in RA ST. 
Flow cytometry analysis of RA synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood revealed 
a greater percentage of monocytes expressing Fkn and CX3CR1 compared with T 
cells. By ELISA, we found significantly elevated soluble Fkn (sFkn) levels in RA 
SF compared with SF from patients with osteoarthritis or other forms of 
arthritis. By RT-PCR, we found enhanced expression of Fkn and CX3CR1 mRNA on day 
18 in rat AIA, a time of pronounced inflammation in the rat joint. Soluble 
Fkn-depleted RA SF showed significantly decreased chemotactic activity for 
monocytes compared with sham-depleted RA SF.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Fkn and its receptor are both expressed 
in RA and in rat AIA, and that sFkn is up-regulated in RA SF. Furthermore, our 
data suggest a new role for Fkn in monocyte chemotaxis in the inflamed RA joint.
