Adjuvants are necessary to elicit high titers of antibodies in 
vaccine-immunization procedures. We previously developed a mouse tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) autovaccine (mTNF-PADRE) capable of inducing 
anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect 
of adjuvant-free administration of the autovaccine on collagen-type-II-induced 
rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) in mice. Our results showed that the vaccine could 
ameliorate the symptoms of CIA in mice. In addition, this study suggests that it 
is possible to control the antibody levels in mice immunized with mTNF-PADRE 
without adjuvant.
