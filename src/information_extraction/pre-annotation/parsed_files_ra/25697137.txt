OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a heterodimeric member of the IL-12 family 
consisting of p35/IL-12a and EBI3/IL-27b subunits. Expressed in murine Treg 
cells, IL-35 controls inflammatory diseases in mouse models. However, human 
IL-35 is expressed in Teff cells rather than in Treg cells and is shown to be 
upregulated under inflammatory conditions. Our aim was to examine the 
involvement of IL-35 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis was used to 
determine the expression and localization of IL-35 and its subunits (p35/EBI3) 
and IL-35 receptor (IL12Rβ2/gp130) in RA, osteoarthritis (OA) and psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) synovial tissues. Expression of p35/EBI3 subunits and release of 
inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with IL-35 were assessed in RA synovial 
fibroblasts (SFs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
RESULTS: Both IL-35 and its subunits were upregulated in RA in comparison with 
OA or PsA synovium. Using cell-specific markers, p35 and EBI3 were identified in 
macrophages, dendritic cells, SFs, and T as well as B cells in RA synovium. Both 
p35 and EBI3 were induced by TNFα in RASFs and PBMCs. IL-35 dose-dependently 
upregulated release of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 in 
PBMCs. While gp130 receptor subunit was upregulated in RA synovium and was 
expressed in RASFs and PBMCs, there was no difference in IL12Rβ2 expression 
subunit among tissues and its presence in RASFs was lacking.
CONCLUSION: Upregulation of IL-35 at sites of inflammation in RA and its 
pro-inflammatory potential suggests that IL-35 might play an important role in 
RA pathogenesis.
