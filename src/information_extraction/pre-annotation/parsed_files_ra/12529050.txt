Tumour necrosis factor (TNFalpha) is a cytokine with a wide range of diverse and 
at times paradoxical effects. These include immunoregulatory, lymphoid 
organogenesis and pro-inflammatory effects. In recent years, TNFalpha has become 
a focus of interest more for its inflammatory effects in a number of chronic 
autoimmune diseases. This interest culminated in the successful treatment of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's diseases and ankylosing spondylitis 
with blocking antibodies or soluble TNFalpha receptors. Paradoxically, however, 
TNFalpha also has immunomodulatory effects in some autoimmune conditions such as 
lupus in some mouse models of the disease and in diabetes in the none-obese 
diabetic mouse. The role TNFalpha plays in human systemic lupus erythematosus 
is, however, controversial. In this article we review some of the studies 
carried out to elucidate the effects of TNFalpha in lupus disease and likely 
mechanisms of action. Further, we discuss recent data on the likely effects of 
blocking TNFalpha on anti-DNA autoantibody production.
