The expression and activity of NF-kappaB in the synovium of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) rats was detected in order to investigate the possible 
therapeutic effects of triptolide on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The experimental 
Wistar rat model of CIA was set up by intradermal injection of emulsion of 
bovine collagen II and the successful rate of setting-up models was evaluated by 
arthritis index (AI). Rats were grouped randomly into three groups: normal, 
model and treatment group. The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in synovial 
fluid was detected by ELISA, and the expression and activity of NF-kappaB in 
synovium by immunohistochemistry method and by electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay (EMSA) respectively. As compared with normal group, the expression of 
TNF-alpha and IL-6 in synovia (P < 0.05), and the expression and activity of 
NF-kappaB (P < 0.05) in synovium were increased in model group. There was 
statistical difference in above-mentioned indexes between model group and 
treatment group. Triptolide may play a protective role in RA via downregulating 
the expression and activity of NF-kappaB in synovium.
