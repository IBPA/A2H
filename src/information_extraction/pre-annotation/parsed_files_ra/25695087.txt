To widen the therapeutic window for PET guided evaluation of novel anti-RA 
agents, modifications were made in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Arthritis was induced in the right knee of Wistar rats with repeated boosting to 
prolong articular inflammation. The contralateral knee served as control. After 
immunization with methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in complete Freund's 
adjuvant and custom Bordetella pertussis antigen, one or more intra-articular 
(i.a.) mBSA injections were given over time in the right knee. Serum anti-mBSA 
antibodies, DTH response, knee thickness, motion, and synovial macrophages were 
analyzed and [18F]FDG(-general inflammation) and (R)-[11C]PK11195 
(macrophages-)PET was performed followed by ex vivo tissue distribution. 
Significant anti-mBSA levels, DTH, swelling of arthritic knee, and sustained and 
prolonged macrophage infiltration in synovial tissue were found, especially 
using multiple i.a. injections. Increased [18F]FDG and (R)-[11C]PK11195 
accumulation was demonstrated in arthritic knees as compared to contralateral 
knees, which was confirmed in ex vivo tissue distribution studies. Boosting 
proved advantageous for achieving a chronic model without remission. The model 
will offer excellent opportunities for repeated PET studies to monitor 
progression of disease and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents for RA in the 
same animal.
