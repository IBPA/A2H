Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), is a natural blocker of the 
inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1. Using a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(AIA) model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we examined the protective effects of 
IL-1Ra in bone metabolism in vivo after folate-mediated nonviral gene delivery. 
We detected secreted human IL-1Ra protein in serum and cultured primary 
osteoblasts of rats that were treated with chitosan-IL-1Ra and 
folate-IL-1Ra-chitosan nanoparticles, respectively. In vivo, IL-1Ra gene 
delivery significantly reverted alterations in bone turnover observed in 
arthritic animals by modulating the level of osteocalcin (OC) as well as the 
activities of alkaline phosphatase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. The 
protective effects of these nanoparticles were evident from the decrease in the 
expression levels of interleukine-1beta and prostaglandin E(2) as well as 
osteoclast number and other histopathological findings. Compared to naked DNA 
and chitosan-DNA, folate-chitosan-DNA nanoparticles were less cytotoxic and 
enhanced IL-1Ra protein synthesis in vitro and offered a better protection 
against inflammation and abnormal bone metabolism in vivo. Nonviral gene therapy 
with folate-chitosan-DNA nanoparticles containing the IL-1 Ra gene seemed to 
protect against bone damage and inflammation in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis 
model.
