Type II collagen (CII) is a candidate cartilage-specific autoantigen, which can 
become post-translationally modified by hydroxylation and glycosylation. T cell 
recognition of CII is essential for the development of murine collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) and also occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The common 
denominator of murine CIA and human RA is the presentation of an immunodominant 
CII-derived glycosylated peptide on murine Aq and human DR4 molecules, 
respectively. To investigate the importance of T cell recognition of 
glycosylated CII in CIA development after immunization with heterologous CII, we 
treated neonatal mice with different heterologous CII-peptides (non-modified, 
hydroxylated and galactosylated). Treatment with the galactosylated peptide 
(galactose at position 264) was superior in protecting mice from CIA. Protection 
was accompanied by a reduced antibody response to CII and by an impaired T cell 
response to the glycopeptide. To investigate the importance of glycopeptide 
recognition in an autologous CIA model, we treated MMC-transgenic mice, which 
express the heterologous CII epitope with a glutamic acid in position 266 in 
cartilage, with CII-peptides. Again, a strong vaccination potential of the 
glycopeptide was seen. Hence CII-glycopeptides may be the optimal choice of 
vaccination target in RA, since humans share the same epitope as the MMC mouse.
