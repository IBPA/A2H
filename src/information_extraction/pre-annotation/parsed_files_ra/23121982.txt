The infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes is a prominent feature of 
inflammatory diseases including human rheumatoid arthritis. Understanding how 
neutrophil recruitment is regulated during pathogenesis is crucial for 
developing anti-inflammatory therapies. We optimized the K/BÃ—N serum-induced 
mouse arthritis model to study neutrophil trafficking dynamics in vivo using 
two-photon microscopy. Arthritogenic serum was injected subcutaneously into one 
hind footpad to induce a local arthritis with robust neutrophil recruitment. 
Using this approach, we showed that the depletion of monocytes with clodronate 
liposomes impaired neutrophil recruitment specifically at the transendothelial 
migration step. The depletion of CCR2(+) monocytes with the monoclonal antibody 
MC-21 reproduced these effects, implicating CCR2(+) monocytes as key regulators 
of neutrophil extravasation during arthritis initiation. However, monocyte 
depletion did not prevent neutrophil extravasation in response to bacterial 
challenge. These findings suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies targeting 
monocytes may act in part through antagonizing neutrophil extravasation at sites 
of aseptic inflammation.
