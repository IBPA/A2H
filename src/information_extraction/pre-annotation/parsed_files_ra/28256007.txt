Expression levels of Notch signaling molecules are increased in synovium from 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is not known which cell 
type(s) in RA synovium have Notch activation or if they play a pathogenetic role 
in RA. Here, we used Hes1-GFP/TNF-transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice to investigate the 
role of cells with active Notch signaling (GFP+) in RA. The number of GFP+ cells 
was significantly increased in synovium in Hes1-GFP/TNF-Tg mice and about 60% of 
them were F4/80+ macrophages expressing the inflammatory macrophage (M1) marker. 
TNF-Tg mice transplanted with Hes1-GFP/TNF-Tg bone marrow (BM) had significantly 
more GFP+ cells in their synovium than in BM. Intraarticular injection of 
Hes1-GFP/TNF-Tg or Hes1-GFP+ BM macrophages into WT and TNF-Tg mice showed the 
highest synovial GFP+ cells in the TNF-Tg mice that received Hes1-GFP/TNF-Tg 
cells. Thapsigargin (THAP), a Notch inhibitor, decreased TNF-induced M1 and 
increased M2 numbers and reduced joint lesion, synovial M1s, and GFP+ cells in 
Hes1-GFP/TNF-Tg mice. THAP did not affect M1s from mice carrying a 
constitutively active Notch1. Thus, the main cells with activated Notch 
signaling in the inflamed synovium of TNF-Tg mice are M1s derived from BM and 
targeting them may represent a new therapeutic approach for patients with 
inflammatory arthritis. Â© 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
