Despite scopolin is a main coumarin constituent in the stems of Erycibe 
obtusifolia Benth, a herb drug that has long been utilized in traditional 
Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, little information 
is available about the pharmacological activities of this compound. The present 
study was performed to investigate the anti-rheumatic effects of scopolin in 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats, and explore the underlying mechanisms 
of action in views of anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties in the 
synovial tissues. Scopolin (50, 100 mg/kg), injected intraperitoneally for 10 
days from the onset of secondary response, significantly inhibited both 
inoculated and non-inoculated paw swelling as well as articular index scores in 
AIA. Meanwhile, the mean body weight of rats treated with scopolin was higher 
than that of model group. Rats treated with high dose of scopolin (100 mg/kg) 
preserved a nearly normal histological architecture of the joints and showed a 
significant reduction of the new blood vessels in the synovial tissues. 
Additionally, scopolin could reduce IL-6, VEGF and FGF-2 expressions in rat 
synovial tissues. In conclusion, scopolin can reduce the clinical symptoms of 
rat AIA by inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis, and this compound may be a 
potent agent for angiogenesis related diseases and can serve as a structural 
base for screening more potent synthetic analogs.
