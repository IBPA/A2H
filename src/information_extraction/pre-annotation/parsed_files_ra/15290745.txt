OBJECTIVE: Antibodies recognizing the ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme 
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) cause arthritis in the K/BxN mouse model. 
Studies have shown that these antibodies are not specific for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in humans. We evaluated GPI as a target of autoantibodies in 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
METHODS: We studied 324 serum and 48 synovial fluid (SF) samples from 103 
patients with JIA, 36 with RA, and 8 with arthralgia and 11 controls. Anti-GPI 
antibodies were assessed by densitometrically evaluating immunoblots and ELISA 
using native and recombinant GPI. We determined the GPI activity of the soluble 
antigen in serum and SF.
RESULTS: Although several samples contained anti-GPI-IgG antibodies, this was 
not specific for JIA or its subgroups, or for RA. Other proteins in the GPI 
preparation were also frequently recognized by antibodies. Additionally, we 
observed increased GPI activity in patients with the systemic manifestation of 
JIA, but not in other patients. Neither anti-GPI concentrations nor GPI activity 
were associated with disease activity.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the findings in RA, our results indicate that GPI is 
not a general target of autoantibodies in JIA.
