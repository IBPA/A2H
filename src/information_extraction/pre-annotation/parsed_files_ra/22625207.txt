AIM: Rapidly expanding manufacture and use of nanomaterials emphasize the 
requirements for thorough assessment of health outcomes associated with novel 
applications. Post-translational protein modifications catalyzed by 
Ca(2+)-dependent peptidylargininedeiminases have been shown to trigger immune 
responses including autoantibody generation, a hallmark of immune complexes 
deposition in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the aim of the study was to 
assess if nanoparticles are able to promote protein citrullination.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Human A549 and THP-1 cells were exposed to silicon dioxide, 
carbon black or single-walled carbon nanotubes. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 
respirable single-walled carbon nanotubes. Protein citrullination, 
peptidylargininedeiminases activity and target proteins were evaluated.
RESULTS: The studied nanoparticles induced protein citrullination both in 
cultured human cells and mouse lung tissues. Citrullination occurred via the 
peptidylargininedeiminase-dependent mechanism. Cytokeratines 7, 8, 18 and 
plectins were identified as intracellular citrullination targets.
CONCLUSION: Nanoparticle exposure facilitated post-translational citrullination 
of proteins.
