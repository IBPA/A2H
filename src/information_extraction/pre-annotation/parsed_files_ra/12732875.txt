Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with intra-articular inflammation 
and synovial hyperplasia that results in progressive degradation of cartilage 
and bone, in severe cases it causes systemic complications. Recently, biological 
agents that suppress the activities of proinflammatory cytokines have shown 
efficacy as antiarthritic drugs, but require frequent administration. Thus, gene 
transfer approaches are being developed as an alternative approach for targeted, 
more efficient and sustained delivery of inhibitors of inflammatory cytokines as 
well as other therapeutic agents. Indeed, the efficacy of gene transfer for the 
treatment of arthritis has been demonstrated in mouse, rat, rabbit, and horse 
models of disease whereas the feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated 
in Phase I clinical trials. In this review, the current status of both 
preclinical and clinical arthritis gene therapy is presented. In addition, the 
advantages and disadvantages of different types of vectors, target cells and 
therapeutic genes being developed for the treatment of arthritis are summarized. 
Finally, the future directions of the rapidly developed field of arthritis gene 
therapy are outlined.
