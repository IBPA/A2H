As a traditional Mongolian medicine, Sendeng-4 (SD) has been widely used to 
treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Inner Mongolia and exhibits a good curative 
effect. Unfortunately, due to geographical factors, it is difficult to 
popularize this drug throughout the whole country, and the mechanism of action 
of SD has been unclear. In this study, a serum metabolite profile analysis was 
performed to identify potential biomarkers associated with adjuvant-induced RA 
and investigate the mechanism of action of SD. Ultraperformance liquid 
chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was performed for the metabonomics analysis. K nearest neighbor 
(KNN) models were established in both positive and negative spectra for 
classifying data from the control, model, and SD administration groups. Accuracy 
rate for classification was 95.8% in positive ion mode and 91.7% in negative ion 
mode. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) enabled 
the identification of 12 metabolites as potential biomarkers of adjuvant-induced 
RA. After treatment with SD, the levels of uridine triphosphate, calcitroic 
acid, dynorphin B (6-9), and docosahexaenoic acid were restored to normal, 
indicating that SD likely ameliorated RA by regulating the levels of these 
biomarkers. This study identified early biomarkers of RA and elucidated the 
underlying mechanism of action of SD, which is worth further investigation for 
development as a clinical therapy.
