Expression of inflammatory cytokines is augmented in the joints of patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that cytokine levels are also elevated in 
the joints of a mouse arthritis model, human T-cell leukemia virus type I 
(HTLV-I) transgenic (Tg) mouse. Depletion of IL-1 by gene targeting greatly 
reduced the incidence of the disease, indicating the importance of this cytokine 
in the development of arthritis. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor antagonist 
(IL-1Ra)-deficient mice develop autoimmunity and arthritis spontaneously. These 
observations suggest that excess IL-1 signaling the causes autoimmunity. We show 
that IL-1 activates the immune system non-specifically by inducing CD40L and 
OX40 co-signaling molecules on T cells. In this review, the roles of IL-1 in the 
development of autoimmunity and arthritis in mouse models will be discussed.
