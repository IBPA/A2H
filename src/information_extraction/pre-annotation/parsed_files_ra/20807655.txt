Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease that affects 1% 
of the population worldwide. In the K/BxN mouse model of RA, autoantibodies 
specific for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) from these mice can transfer 
joint-specific inflammation to normal mice. The binding of GPI/autoantibody to 
the cartilage surface is a prerequisite for autoantibody-induced joint-specific 
inflammation in the mouse model. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) on cartilage surface 
is the long sought high-affinity receptor for GPI. The binding affinity and 
structural differences between mouse paw/ankle CS and knee/elbow CS correlate 
with the distal to proximal disease severity in these joints. The data presented 
in this chapter indicate that autoantigen/autoantibodies in blood circulation 
activate contact system to produce vasodilators to allow immune complex, protein 
aggregates, and other plasma proteins to get into the joints. Cartilage surface 
CS binds and retains autoantigen/autoantibodies. The CS/autoantigen/autoantibody 
complexes could induce C3a and C5a production through contact system activation. 
C3a and C5a trigger degranulation of mast cells, which further recruit plasma 
contact system and complement proteins, immune cells, and immune activation 
factors to facilitate joint-specific tissue destruction. Therefore, either 
reducing autoantibody production or inhibiting autoantibody-induced contact 
system activation might be effective in RA prevention.
