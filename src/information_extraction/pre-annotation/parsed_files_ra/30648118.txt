Pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in mice is an experimental model that resembles 
human rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects joints and 
is characterized by synovial inflammation and articular cartilage and bone 
destruction. AIRmax and AIRmin mouse lines differ in their susceptibility to 
PIA, and linkage analysis in this model mapped arthritis severity QTLs in 
chromosomes 5 and 8. miRNAs are a class of small RNA molecules that have been 
extensively studied in the development of arthritis. We analyzed miRNA and gene 
expression profiles in peritoneal cells of AIRmax and AIRmin lines, in order to 
evaluate the genetic architecture in this model. Susceptible AIRmax mice showed 
higher gene (2025 vs 1043) and miRNA (240 vs 59) modulation than resistant 
AIRmin mice at the onset of disease symptoms. miR-132-3p/212-3p, miR-106-5p, 
miR-27b-3p, and miR-25-3p were among the miRNAs with the highest expression in 
susceptible animals, showing a negative correlation with the expression of 
predicted target genes (Il10, Cd69, and Sp1r1). Our study showed that global 
gene and miRNA expression profiles in peritoneal cells of susceptible AIRmax and 
resistant AIRmin lines during pristane-induced arthritis are distinct, 
evidencing interesting targets for further validation.
