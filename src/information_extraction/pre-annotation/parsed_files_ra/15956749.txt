A reduction in the incidence and severity of rheumatoid arthritis is seen in 
pregnant women. Relaxin, a hormone of pregnancy, has been implicated in 
decreased immune responsiveness. Consequently, the effects of relaxin and 
estradiol valerate, alone or in combination, were assessed in the development of 
adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat. Combination hormone therapy reduced 
adjuvant-induced paw inflammation. Radiographic analysis of the tarsal joints 
showed that estradiol valerate plus relaxin treatment minimized soft tissue 
damage and bone changes when compared to vehicle-treated arthritic controls. 
These results indicate that relaxin may be a factor in reducing inflammation 
during pregnancy.
