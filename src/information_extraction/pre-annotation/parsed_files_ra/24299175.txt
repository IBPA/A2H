INTRODUCTION: Targeting the CD20 antigen has been a successful therapeutic 
intervention in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, in some 
patients with an inadequate response to anti-CD20 therapy, a persistence of 
CD20- plasmablasts is noted. The strong expression of CD319 on CD20- plasmablast 
and plasma cell populations in RA synovium led to the investigation of the 
potential of CD319 as a therapeutic target.
METHODS: PDL241, a novel humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD319, was 
generated and examined for its ability to inhibit immunoglobulin production from 
plasmablasts and plasma cells generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) in the presence and absence of RA synovial fibroblasts (RA-SF). The in 
vivo activity of PDL241 was determined in a human PBMC transfer into NOD scid 
IL-2 gamma chain knockout (NSG) mouse model. Finally, the ability of PDL241 to 
ameliorate experimental arthritis was evaluated in a collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) model in rhesus monkeys.
RESULTS: PDL241 bound to plasmablasts and plasma cells but not na√Øve B cells. 
Consistent with the binding profile, PDL241 inhibited the production of IgM from 
in vitro PBMC cultures by the depletion of CD319+ plasmablasts and plasma cells 
but not B cells. The activity of PDL241 was dependent on an intact Fc portion of 
the IgG1 and mediated predominantly by natural killer cells. Inhibition of IgM 
production was also observed in the human PBMC transfer to NSG mouse model. 
Treatment of rhesus monkeys in a CIA model with PDL241 led to a significant 
inhibition of anti-collagen IgG and IgM antibodies. A beneficial effect on joint 
related parameters, including bone remodeling, histopathology, and joint 
swelling was also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The activity of PDL241 in both in vitro and in vivo models 
highlights the potential of CD319 as a therapeutic target in RA.
