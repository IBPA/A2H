Adoptive cell transfer experiments can be used to study the roles of cell 
trafficking molecules on the migratory behavior of specific immune cell 
populations in vivo. Chemoattractants and their G protein-coupled 
seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors regulate migration of cells in vivo, and 
dysregulated expression of chemoattractants and their receptors is implicated in 
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory arthritides, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory 
cells into joints. The K/BxN serum transfer mouse model of inflammatory 
arthritis shares many similar features with RA. In this autoantibody-induced 
model of arthritis, neutrophils are the critical immune cells necessary for the 
development of joint inflammation and damage. We have used adoptive neutrophil 
transfer to define the contributions of chemoattractant receptors, cytokines, 
and activation receptors expressed on neutrophils that critically regulate their 
entry into the inflamed joint. In this review, we describe the procedure of 
neutrophil adoptive transfer to study the influence of neutrophil-specific 
receptors or mediators upon the their recruitment into the joint using the K/BxN 
model of inflammatory arthritis as a model of how adoptive cell transfer studies 
can be used to study immune cell migration in vivo.
