IDEC is developing a PRIMATIZED-anti-B7 antibody (IDEC-114) for the treatment of 
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid 
arthritis. It is currently undergoing phase II trials in patients with psoriasis 
[395813]. A randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose phase II study 
was initiated in January 2001 to evaluate the potential clinical activity and 
safety of IDEC-114 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis [395813]. The 
antibody targets the B7 antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells that 
normally interact with T-cells to initiate an immune response. Antibodies 
directed at B7 may be useful in preventing unwanted immune responses in 
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura as well as transplant rejection [178382], [178929]. 
PRIMATIZED antibodies, genetically engineered from cynomolgus macaque monkey and 
human components, are structurally indistinguishable from human antibodies. They 
may, therefore, be less likely to cause adverse reactions in humans, making them 
potentially suited for long-term, chronic treatment [244805]. IDEC has signed an 
antibody humanization patent licensing agreement with Protein Design Labs 
[240591]. IDEC is also collaborating with Mitsubishi-Tokyo (formerly Mitsubishi 
Kasei) on the development of this antibody [178382].
