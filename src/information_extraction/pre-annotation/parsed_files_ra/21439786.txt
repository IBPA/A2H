Autoimmune responses to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleproteins (hnRNP) occur in 
many systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. In RA, humoral and/or cellular 
autoimmunity to hnRNP-A2/B1 is the most prominent anti-nuclear reactivity, being 
detectable in more than 50% of patients. However, its pathogenic role has not 
been fully elucidated yet. Here, we report that splenocytes from rats with 
pristane-induced arthritis transfer disease after in vitro restimulation with 
hnRNP-A/B antigens. Remarkably, disease transfer can be blocked by nuclease 
treatment of hnRNPs and is also achieved with splenocytes stimulated with 
hnRNP-A/B associated DNA or RNA oligonucleotides (ON) alone. Induction of 
proinflammatory cytokines in splenocytes stimulated with hnRNP-A/Bs or ONs 
involves Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 9 but not TLR3. Furthermore, although T 
cells are the main mediators of disease transfer they require restimulation with 
TLR-activated antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages in order to become 
arthritogenic. Thus, the autoantigenic properties of hnRNPs appear to be 
mediated by their associated nucleic acids binding to TLR7 and 9. Our data 
explain the specific selection of hnRNP-A2/B1 as autoantigen in RA and reveal 
the requirement of interaction between innate and adaptive immunity to initiate 
and drive inflammation in autoimmune arthritis.
