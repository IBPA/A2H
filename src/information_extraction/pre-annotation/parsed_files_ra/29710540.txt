BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that 
primarily results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. In this study, we 
investigate the potentially therapeutic role of artesunate (Art) on chondrocyte 
proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
METHODS: Rat model of RA was successfully established through subcutaneous 
injection of emulsion. Positive protein expression rates of PI3K, AKT and mTOR 
were determined by immunohistochemistry. RA chondrocytes were initially 
randomized into five different groups. The mRNA expressions of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, 
Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, LC3-I, LC3-II and Becline-1 were measured by RT-qPCR. Protein 
expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, LC3-I, LC3-II and 
Becline-1 were determined using western blotting. The chondrocytes of rats with 
RA and normal rats were isolated and cultured in vitro. Chondrocyte 
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and autophagy were all determined by CCK-8 
assay, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscope (TEM).
RESULTS: Artesunate alleviated the inflammation and did not produce any form of 
hepatotoxicity in rats with RA. In addition, Artesunate decreased expressions of 
PI3K, AKT, mTOR, p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl and increased Bax, 
LC3II/LC3I and Becline-1 protein expression. Artesunate also inhibited 
chondrocyte proliferation and accelerates cell apoptosis and autophagy via 
suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that Art inhibits chondrocyte proliferation 
and accelerates apoptosis and autophagy in RA rats through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathway.
