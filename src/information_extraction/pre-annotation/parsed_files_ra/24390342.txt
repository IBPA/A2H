A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to 
integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data 
sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for 
complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a 
genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of 
European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by 
evaluating âˆ¼10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel 
RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 
(refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics 
methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait 
loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap 
with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and 
knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 
101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved 
therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications 
may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic 
study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute 
to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can 
provide important information for drug discovery.
