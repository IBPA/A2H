INTRODUCTION: Recent epidemiologic studies have implicated smoking as an 
environmental risk factor for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
aim of the present study is the evaluation of the role of cigarette smoke (CS) 
in the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis in mice.
METHODS: DBA/1 mice exposed to CS for 16 weeks (n = 25) and mice exposed to 
nicotine in drinking water (n = 10) were immunized with collagen type II (CII). 
Severity of arthritis was evaluated clinically and morphologically and compared 
with control mice (n = 35). Intensity of inflammation was evaluated by serum 
IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels. Additionally, antibody response to CII (anti-CII) and 
citrullinated peptides (aCCP) was measured.
RESULTS: Clinical evaluation of arthritis showed a delayed onset of arthritis in 
CS-exposed mice compared with non-smoking controls (P < 0.05). Histologic index 
and weight changes were comparable between the groups; however, smoking mice 
presented less weight loss during the acute phase of the disease and gained 
weight significantly faster in the recovery phase (P < 0.05). Similar results 
were obtained in the mice exposed to nicotine. Nicotine also showed a direct 
anti-inflammatory effect diminishing IL-6 production by stimulated splenocytes 
in vitro (P < 0.001). Additionally, smoking mice had lower levels of aCCP and 
anti-CII antibodies compared with non-smoking (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Neither smoking nor nicotine exposure aggravates development of 
CII-induced arthritis in mouse model. Moreover, CS exposure was associated with 
a lower level of anti-CII antibodies, providing a possible explanation for a 
delay of arthritis onset in this group.
