Rheumatoid arthritis is considered a serious public health problem, which is 
commonly treated with traditional Chinese or herbal medicine. The present study 
evaluated the effects of Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth. extraction (BCBE) 
on a type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Wistar rats with CIA 
received either 125 or 500 mg/kg BCBE, after which, paw swelling was markedly 
suppressed compared with in the model group. In addition, BCBE significantly 
ameliorated pathological joint alterations, including synovial hyperplasia, and 
cartilage and bone destruction. The protein and mRNA expression levels of 
interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑8, tumor necrosis factor‑α and nuclear factor‑κB in 
synovial tissue were determined by immunohistochemical staining, western blot 
analysis and reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction. The results 
demonstrated that the expression levels of these factors were significantly 
downregulated in the BCBE‑treated group compared with in the model group. These 
results indicated that BCBE may exert an inhibitory effect on the CIA rat model, 
and its therapeutic potential is associated with its anti-inflammatory action.
