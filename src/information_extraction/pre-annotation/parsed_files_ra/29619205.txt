The detection of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in vivo is vitally important because 
the local concentration of HOCl is highly correlated with some diseases such as 
atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, in vivo detection of HOCl 
remains a challenge due to the lack of a suitable probe. We report here a 
near-infrared (NIR) emissive "turn-on" probe (FDOCl-1) based on a methylene blue 
derivative, which can quickly detect HOCl via a newly found deformylation 
mechanism. FDOCl-1 displays remarkable selectivity and sensitivity towards HOCl. 
The dramatic changes in colour and NIR emission were used to detect HOCl in 
vitro and in vivo in a mouse arthritis model.
