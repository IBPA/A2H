Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blockade of TNFα by monoclonal antibody has been 
widely used for the therapy of RA since the 1990s; however, its mechanism of 
efficacy, and potential safety concerns of the treatment are still not fully 
understood. This study sought to establish a transgenic arthritic mouse model by 
overexpressing human TNFα (hTNFα) and to apply this model as a means to evaluate 
therapeutic consequences of TNFα inhibitors. The transgenic mouse line (TgTC) 
with FVB background was generated by incorporating 3'-modifiedhTNFαgene 
sequences. A progressively erosive polyarthritis developed in the TgTC mice, 
with many characteristics observed in human rheumatoid arthritis, including 
polyarticular swelling, impairment of movement, synovial hyperplasia, and 
cartilage and bone erosion. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that hTNFα is 
not only expressed in hyperplastic synovial membrane, but also in tissues 
without lesions, including brain, lung and kidney. Treatment of the TgTC mice 
with anti-hTNFα monoclonal antibodies (mAb) significantly decreased the level of 
hTNFα in the diseased joint and effectively prevented development of arthritis 
in a dose-dependent response fashion. Our results indicated that the TgTC mice 
represent a genetic model which can be used to comprehensively investigate the 
pathogenesis and therapeutics of TNFα-related diseases.
