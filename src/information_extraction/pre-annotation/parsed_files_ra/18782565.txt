Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that 
results in progressive joint destruction and substantial morbidity. The stem of 
the Chinese medicinal plant, Sinomenium acutum Rehder & Wilson (Family 
Menispermaceae), has been used to treat various rheumatic and arthritic 
diseases, of which the major bioactive component is sinomenine. We investigated 
the nature and molecular mechanisms of the anti-arthritic effect of sinomenine 
on collagen-induced arthritis in female Wistar rats. The results showed that 
sinomenine markedly suppressed the incidence and disease progression of 
established CIA, showing as dramatic reduction of paw swelling, ESR, and 
arthritic scores. Sinomenine suppressed the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 in serum, inhibited the protein expressions and 
activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and elevated the protein expressions and 
activities of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 in rat paw tissues.
