Rheumatic diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders, and many of them are 
autoimmune diseases. Class I phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks) are enzymes 
that phosphorylate phosphoinositides in response to extracellular stimuli and 
regulates cellular activation, proliferation, and migration, in a variety of 
cell types, suggesting that they play critical roles in the development of 
inflammation. In patients with rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), recent reports have shown 
convincing pathogenic evidence for the involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling 
pathways in chronic inflammation. Moreover, selective inhibition of PI3K Î³ 
reduced incidence and severity of the renal disease. More recently, the kinome 
array analysis revealed particular up-regulation of PI3K in B cells from 
patients with SLE in comparison with matched controls. Up-regulation of PI3K in 
T cells was also reported in patients with SLE. Further, we have demonstrated 
anti-rheumatic effects of a novel PI3K-specific inhibitor, ZSTK474, in mouse 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Administration of ZSTK474, even if started 
after the development of arthritis, ameliorated CIA with no apparent adverse 
effect. Proliferation of B lymphocytes and synovial fibroblasts were inhibited 
by ZSTK474 in vitro. ZSTK474 suppressed osteoclast formation in vitro and also 
in the joints of CIA mice. These findings indicate that PI3K might be a 
potential therapeutic target of rheumatic diseases.
