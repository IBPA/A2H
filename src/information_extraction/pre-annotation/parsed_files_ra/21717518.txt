Recently, the isolation of several condensed tannins from the roots of Rosa 
multiflora Thunberg, a traditional herbal therapy in oriental medicine for 
rheumatoid arthritis and scabies, was described. Two of the major condensed 
tannins - procyanidin B-3 (ProB3) and ent-guibourtinidol-(4β → 6)-catechin 
(RM-1) - were then applied topically to atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions on 
NC/Nga mice in order to assess their immunomodulatory properties. Both ProB3 and 
RM-1 significantly reduced the serum levels of eosinophils, IgE and certain Th2 
cytokines (IL-4, 5 and 13) (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Additionally, ProB3 and RM-1 
significantly reduced both the mRNA and protein expression of COX-2 and iNOS in 
mouse skin tissues (p < 0.01). Such results strongly suggest that ProB3 and RM-1 
may be useful in the treatment allergic skin conditions, most notably atopic 
dermatitis.
