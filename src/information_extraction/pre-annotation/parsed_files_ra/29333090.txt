The risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, in the elderly 
population increases along with that of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Identifying specific biomarkers for RA 
can clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms and can aid diagnosis and 
patient care. To this end, the present study investigated the genes and proteins 
that are differentially expressed in RA using a mouse collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) model. We performed gene microarray and proteome array analyses using 
blood samples from the mice and found that 50 genes and 24 proteins were 
upregulated and 48 genes were downregulated by more than 2-fold in the CIA model 
relative to the control. The gene microarray and proteome array results were 
validated by evaluating the expression levels of select genes and proteins by 
real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. We found that the level of 
integrin Î±2, which has not been previously reported as a biomarker of RA, was 
significantly increased in CIA mice as compared to controls. These findings 
provide a set of novel biomarkers that can be useful for diagnosing and 
evaluating the progression of RA.
