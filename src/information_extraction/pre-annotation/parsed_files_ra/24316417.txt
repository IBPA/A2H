Bone-resorbing osteoclasts play an essential role in normal bone homeostasis, as 
well as in various bone disorders such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Previously we showed that the Tec family of tyrosine kinases is essential for 
the differentiation of osteoclasts and the inhibition of Btk is a promising 
strategy for the prevention of the bone loss in osteoclast-associated bone 
disorders. Here we demonstrate that an orally available Btk inhibitor, ibrutinib 
(PCI-32765), suppresses osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting both 
osteoclast differentiation and function. Ibrutinib downregulated the expression 
of NFATc1, the key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, and disrupted 
the formation of the actin ring in mature osteoclasts. In addition, genome-wide 
screening revealed that Btk regulates the expression of the genes involved in 
osteoclast differentiation and function in both an NFATc1-dependent and 
-independent manner. Finally, we showed that ibrutinib administration 
ameliorated the bone loss that developed in a RANKL-induced osteoporosis mouse 
model. Thus, this study suggests ibrutinib to be a promising therapeutic agent 
for osteoclast-associated bone diseases.
