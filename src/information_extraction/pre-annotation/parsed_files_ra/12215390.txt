Endogenous heterophilic antibodies in blood are known to interfere with two-site 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) evoking false positive signals. In 
the present study, we describe an assay for the assessment of components of the 
plasminogen activation system (uPA, tPA and PAI-1, and their complexes) in blood 
which is not susceptible to interference by heterophilic antibodies. In the 
ELISA format, two avian (duck, chicken) antibodies are employed in the 
pre-analyte and two mammalian (rabbit, goat) antibodies in the post-analyte 
stage. The assay is compared to our earlier reported ELISA for measuring uPA, 
tPA and PAI-1 components in tumor tissue extracts. Applying the so-called 
"nonsense formats", designed against non-existent components, to the NIBSC 
reference preparation of rheumatoid factor (RF), no response was found with the 
new assay, whereas a clear RF dose-dependent interfering signal was observed 
with the original assay designed for tumor tissue extracts. Analysis of 
tumor-tissue based international reference preparations (RBG EORTC 101094 and 
040297), human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) containing sera, and sera from 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), also displayed no false positive 
signals. In conclusion, we have developed an ELISA that permits the 
determination of blood levels of components in the urokinase system, free from 
disturbance by endogenous heterophilic antibodies.
