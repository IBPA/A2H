INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant arthritis (AA) shares several features with human 
rheumatoid arthritis, and it can be induced in the Lewis (LEW) rat but not the 
Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat (both RT.1(l)) by immunization with heat-killed 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We set out to unravel the mechanisms 
underlying the differential susceptibility to AA of these MHC-compatible rat 
strains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the levels of T-cell proliferative and 
cytokine response to the immunoregulatory self (rat) hsp65 (Rhsp65) after an 
arthritogenic (Mtb) challenge and the kinetics of migration of adoptively 
transferred, (111)Indium-labeled, Mtb-primed leukocytes into the hind paw joints 
of recipient rats.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The WKY rats raised a significantly higher level of 
T-cell proliferative response coupled with a temporally opposite cytokine 
profile against the disease-regulating Rhsp65 compared to that of LEW rats. 
Moreover, the arthritogenic leukocytes accumulated into the joints of WKY rats 
at significantly lower numbers than that in LEW rats.
CONCLUSIONS: These results offer novel insights into the immune events 
influencing the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis.
