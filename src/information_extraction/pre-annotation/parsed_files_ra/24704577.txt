Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have proved to be 
important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because the outcome of RA has greatly 
improved with the recent availability of biologics targeting them. It is well 
accepted that these cytokines are involved in the activation of the nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, but our understanding of the dependency of 
these pro-inflammatory cytokines and the link between them in RA is currently 
limited. Recently, we and others proved the importance of TNFα-induced protein 
(TNFAIP), due to the spontaneous development of arthritis in deficient animals 
that are dependent on IL-6. To date, nine TNFAIPs have been identified, and 
TNFAIP3 and TNFAIP9 were found to be clearly associated with mouse and human 
arthritis. In this review, we compare and discuss recent TNFAIP topics, 
especially focusing on TNFAIP3 and TNFAIP9 in autoimmune arthritis in mice and 
humans.
