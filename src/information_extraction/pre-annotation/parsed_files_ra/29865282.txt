We analyzed the influence of treadmill running on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
joints using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Eight-week-old male 
Dark Agouti rats were randomly divided into four groups: The control group, 
treadmill group (30 min/day for 4 weeks from 10-weeks-old), CIA group (induced 
CIA at 8-weeks-old), and CIA + treadmill group. Destruction of the ankle joint 
was evaluated by histological analyses. Morphological changes of subchondral 
bone were analyzed by μ-CT. CIA treatment-induced synovial membrane invasion, 
articular cartilage destruction, and bone erosion. Treadmill running improved 
these changes. The synovial membrane in CIA rats produced a large amount of 
tumor necrosis factor-α and Connexin 43; production was significantly suppressed 
by treadmill running. On μ-CT of the talus, bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was 
significantly decreased in the CIA group. Marrow star volume (MSV), an index of 
bone loss, was significantly increased. These changes were significantly 
improved by treadmill running. Bone destruction in the talus was significantly 
increased with CIA and was suppressed by treadmill running. On 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphate and alkaline phosphatase (TRAP/ALP) staining, 
the number of osteoclasts around the pannus was decreased by treadmill running. 
These findings indicate that treadmill running in CIA rats inhibited synovial 
hyperplasia and joint destruction.
