BACKGROUND: The incidence and characteristics of spontaneous ankylosis in the 
ankle of specific F(1) mice descended from two Fas-deficient strains were 
reported. Here the coincidence of synovial proliferation and ankylosis in the 
descendent F(2) mice is reported.
AIM: To clarify whether the two distinct manifestations are genetically 
different.
METHODS: An arthropathic group of mice (MCF(2)) were bred by intercrossing 
MRL/Mp.Fas(lpr)-sap(-)/sap(-) and C3H/He.Fas(lpr) mice. All mice were killed by 
bleeding under anaesthesia when they were 6 months old. Pathological grades for 
synovial proliferation were determined by microscopical examination. To obtain a 
linkage locus, the whole genome of male MCF(2) mice was scanned by using 73 
microsatellite markers.
RESULTS: Synovial proliferation was equally observed in male and female MCF(2) 
mice. No correlation was observed between the grades of synovial proliferation 
and the ankylosis occurring in the MCF(2) mice. A suggestive susceptibility 
locus was shown in the middle of chromosome 11. This locus was an MRL allele 
with a recessive inheritance mode.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenic mechanisms of synovial proliferation and ankylosis 
are genetically different. The present locus is overlapped with some loci 
associated with rheumatoid arthritis and with others associated with 
experimental arthritides.
