Neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and various inflammatory conditions, by accumulation and liberation of 
active proteolytic enzymes. The effect of milk extract of Semecarpus anacardium 
Linn. nuts (SA) at a dosage of 150 mg kg(-1) body weight day(-1) for 14 days on 
adjuvant arthritis was studied to gain some insight into this intriguing disease 
in relation to neutrophil functions. The decreased phagocytic function of 
neutrophils (phagocytic index and avidity index) found in adjuvant arthritis was 
significantly increased by the administration of the drug SA. Increased levels 
of reactive oxygen species (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, H2O2 and 
myeloperoxidase), lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase and cathepsin D) and 
increased accumulation of neutrophils in the joints observed in adjuvant 
arthritic animals were reverted back to near normal levels by treatment with SA. 
The results of this study indicate that SA can be considered to be a good 
therapeutic agent for inflammation and arthritis.
