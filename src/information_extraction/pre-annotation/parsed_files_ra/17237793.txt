Degenerative and inflammatory joint diseases lead to a destruction of the joint 
architecture. Whereas degenerative osteoarthritis results in the formation of 
new bone, rheumatoid arthritis leads to bone resorption. The molecular basis of 
these different patterns of joint disease is unknown. By inhibiting Dickkopf-1 
(DKK-1), a regulatory molecule of the Wnt pathway, we were able to reverse the 
bone-destructive pattern of a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis to the 
bone-forming pattern of osteoarthritis. In this way, no overall bone erosion 
resulted, although bony nodules, so-called osteophytes, did form. We identified 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) as a key inducer of DKK-1 in the mouse 
inflammatory arthritis model and in human rheumatoid arthritis. These results 
suggest that the Wnt pathway is a key regulator of joint remodeling.
