AIM: To evaluate the impact of previously unrecognized negative interaction 
between the Wnt and interleukin (IL) 6 signaling pathways in skeletal tissues as 
a possible major mechanism leading to age- and inflammation-related destruction 
of bone and joints.
METHODS: Luciferase reporter assays were performed to monitor Wnt pathway 
activation upon IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) treatment. Functional 
contribution of IL-6 and TNFα interaction to inhibition of bone formation was 
evaluated in vitro using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) in mouse mesenchymal 
precursor cells (MPC) of C2C12 and KS483 lines induced to differentiate into 
osteoblasts by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP).
RESULTS: IL-6 inhibited the activation of Wnt signaling in primary human 
synoviocytes, and, together with TNFα and Dickkopf-1, inhibited the activation 
of Wnt response. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of IL-6 mRNA significantly increased 
early BMP2/7-induced osteogenesis and rescued it from the negative effect of 
TNFα in C2C12 cells, as well as intensified bone matrix mineralization in KS483 
cells.
CONCLUSION: IL-6 is an important mediator in the inhibition of osteoblast 
differentiation by TNFα, and knockdown of IL-6 partially rescues osteogenesis 
from the negative control of inflammation. The anti-osteoblastic effects of IL-6 
are most likely mediated by its negative interaction with Wnt signaling pathway.
