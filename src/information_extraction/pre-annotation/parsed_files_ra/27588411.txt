Previous studies have shown that hydroxytyrosol (HT) can be a potential 
alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
However, HT is extensively metabolized following oral administration, which 
leads to formulating HT in a topical vehicle to prolong drug action as well as 
to provide a localized effect. Hidrox-6 is a freeze-dried powder derived from 
fresh olives and contains a high amount of HT (âˆ¼3%) and other polyphenols. 
Alginate bilayer films containing 5% and 10% Hidrox-6 were formulated. The films 
were characterized with respect to their physical, morphology, rheological 
properties; drug content uniformity; and in vitro drug release. Acute dermal 
irritancy tests and a skin sensitization study were carried out in rats. An 
efficacy study of the bilayer films for RA was conducted using Freund's 
adjuvant-induced polyarthritis rats. Animal data showed that the bilayer film 
formulations did not cause skin irritancy. The efficacy in vivo results showed 
that the Hidrox-6 bilayer films lowered the arthritic scores, paw and ankle 
circumference, serum IL-6 level and cumulative histological scores compared with 
those measured for controls. The topical Hidrox-6 bilayer films improve 
synovitis and inflammatory symptoms in RA and can be a potential alternative to 
oral RA therapy.
