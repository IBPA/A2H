Diseases caused by immune inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis, and Crohn's disease, are intractable diseases to which novel 
therapeutics are highly demanded. Prostaglandin (PG) E(2) is the most 
ubiquitously produced PG with various actions. PGE(2) has been traditionally 
regarded as an immunosuppressant based on its inhibition of T cell activation in 
vitro. However, in vivo relevance of the immunosuppressant action of PGE(2) has 
remained obscure. Recently, several groups including ourselves have made 
unexpected findings that PGE(2) facilitates expansion of the Th17 subset of T 
helper cells of both human and mouse through elevation of cAMP via PGE receptors 
EP2 and EP4. We have further found that PGE(2) can induce and not suppress Th1 
differentiation under certain conditions, again, through EP2 and EP4. Given the 
putative roles of these Th subsets in immune diseases such as the above, these 
findings suggest that, on the contrary to the traditional view, PGE(2) functions 
as a mediator of immune inflammation. Consistently, administration of an EP4 
antagonist could suppress disease progression and development of 
antigen-specific Th17 cells in mice subjected to experimental allergic 
encephalomyelitis and contact hypersensitivity. In this perspective, we review 
these findings and discuss the prospect of EP4 antagonists as immunomodulatory 
drugs.
