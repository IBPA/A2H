Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, the pathogenesis of which is 
affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors. To understand the 
genetic and molecular basis of RA, a large number of quantitative trait loci 
(QTL) that regulate experimental autoimmune arthritis have been identified using 
various rat models for RA. However, identifying the particular responsible genes 
within these QTL remains a major challenge. Using currently available genome 
data and gene annotation information, we systematically examined RA-associated 
genes and polymorphisms within and outside QTL over the whole rat genome. By the 
whole genome analysis of genes and polymorphisms, we found that there are 
significantly more RA-associated genes in QTL regions as contrasted with non-QTL 
regions. Further experimental studies are necessary to determine whether these 
known RA-associated genes or polymorphisms are genetic components causing the 
QTL effect.
