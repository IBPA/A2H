OBJECTIVE: The balance between effector and regulatory CD4+ T cells plays a key 
role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was 
to examine whether the RA autoantigen BiP has epitopes for both effector and 
regulatory immunities.
METHODS: The proliferation and cytokine secretion of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DR4-positive RA patients in response to 
BiP-derived peptides were examined by (3)H-thymidine uptake and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. As a mouse therapeutic model, a BiP-derived peptide was 
administered orally to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
RESULTS: Among the peptides examined, BiP(336-355) induced the strongest 
proliferation of PBMCs from RA patients, but not from healthy donors. The 
proliferation of PBMCs in response to BiP(336-355) showed a correlation with 
clinical RA activity and serum anti-BiP/citrullinated BiP antibodies. In 
contrast, BiP(456-475) induced interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion from 
CD25-positive PBMCs obtained from RA patients and healthy donors without 
inducing cell proliferation, and it actively suppressed the BiP(336-355)-induced 
proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by PBMCs. Oral 
administration of BiP(456-475) to mice with CIA reduced the severity of 
arthritis and T cell proliferation and increased the secretion of IL-10 from T 
cells as well as the number of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.
CONCLUSION: Effector and regulatory T cells recognized different BiP epitopes. 
The deviated balance toward BiP-specific effector T cells in RA may be 
associated with disease activity; therefore, BiP-specific effector or regulatory 
T cells could be a target of new RA therapies.
