Autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by chronic inflammation and 
hyperplasia in the synovial joints. Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis 
is largely unknown, substantial evidence has supported the importance of immune 
cells and inflammatory cytokines in the initiation and progression of this 
disease. Herein, we demonstrated that the benzoxathiole derivative 
2-cyclohexylimino-6-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzo[1,3]oxathiol-4-one (BOT-4-one) 
alleviated type II collagen-induced arthritis in a mouse model. The levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in both human patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis and mice with collagen-induced arthritis. BOT-4-one treatment reduced 
the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice and endotoxin-stimulated 
macrophages. BOT-4-one treatment suppressed the polarization of Th1- and 
Th17-cell subsets by inhibiting the expression and production of their 
lineage-specific master transcription factors and cytokines, as well as 
activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins. In 
addition, BOT-4-one inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB 
signaling as well as the transcriptional activities and DNA-binding of 
transcription factors, including activator protein-1, cAMP response 
element-binding protein and NF-kappaB. Our results suggest that BOT-4-one may 
have therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic inflammation associated 
with autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis.
