PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to develop a targeted nanoparticle platform 
for T cell labeling and tracking in vivo.
PROCEDURES: Through carboxylation of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface of 
SPION, carboxylated-PEG-SPION (IOPC) was generated as a precursor for further 
conjugation with the targeting probe. The IOPC could readily cross-link with a 
variety of amide-containing molecules by exploiting the reaction between 
1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The 
subsequent conjugation of monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody with IOPC made it 
possible to construct a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agente (CA) 
that targets T cells, named IOPC-CD3.
RESULTS: IOPC-CD3 was found to have high transverse relaxivity, good targeting 
selectivity, and good safety profile in vitro. The utility of this newly 
synthesized CA was explored in an in vivo rodent collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) model of rheumatoid arthritis. Serial MRI experiments revealed a selective 
decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of the femoral growth plates of CIA rats 
infused with IOPC-CD3, with this finding being consistent with 
immunohistochemical results showing the accumulation of T cells and iron oxide 
nanoparticles in the corresponding region.
CONCLUSIONS: Together with the abovementioned desirable features, these results 
indicate that IOPC-CD3 offers a promising prospect for a wide range of cellular 
and molecular MRI applications.
