Tripterygium Glycosides (TG) is effective in the treatment of patients with a 
variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in clinical. Wilforlide A (T(1)) serves as a quality control standard of TG 
that be listed in Drug Standard of Ministry of Public Health of the People's 
Republic of China. The pharmacologic actions of T(1) remain to be unidentified. 
In this paper, we studied the anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive effect of 
T(1), and compared it with Triptolide (TP), which believed to be the major 
active component of TG. Carrageenan-induced rat pedal swelling, tampon-induced 
rat granulation, and mice ear inhibition rate of swelling trail results show 
that high-dose T(1) has obvious anti-inflammatory effect. Colorimetric detection 
contents of hemolysin, carbon elimination from plasma of mice, mice delayed 
hypersensitivity immune, and organ index were measured. The results show that 
T(1) has no significant immune suppressive activity, and there has a significant 
difference with TP and TG. Therefore, we think the content of TP also should be 
controlled as a supplement standard in order to ensure safe and effective 
medication.
