It has been 3 years since rituximab, a mouse x human chimeric anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody that selectively depleted B cells, was approved by the FDA 
for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an 
inadequate response to anti-TNF therapies. Since approval rituximab has become a 
part of standard treatment, and additional data have become available on 
long-term efficacy and safety both from clinical trials and from post-marketing 
surveillance. In open long-term follow-up from clinical trials, patients treated 
with multiple courses of rituximab continued to respond in terms of signs and 
symptoms, and damage assessed radiographically was significantly inhibited. 
Moreover, the rate of serious infectious events was not increased as the number 
of courses increased. However, because of case reports of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with rituximab for non-malignant 
conditions, a black box warning has been added. Studies on the immunologic 
correlates of response to rituximab treatment including B cell subsets in 
peripheral blood and synovial biopsies are providing clues into how rituximab 
works for autoimmune disease. However, at this time we are not able to explain 
why some patients do not respond and cannot predict who will respond. Future 
challenges for the further development of rituximab for intractable RA will be 
discussed.
