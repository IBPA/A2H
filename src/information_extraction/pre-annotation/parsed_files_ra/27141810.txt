OBJECTIVES: The early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is 
important to reduce joint destruction. Many of the current imaging techniques 
have disadvantages, such as the need for contrast agents and interpretation by 
specialists. Fluorescence imaging is an emerging technique that overcomes some 
of these problems. The aim of this study was to determine whether near-infrared 
(NIR) fluorescence imaging of indocyanine green (ICG)-lactosomes can detect 
joint inflammation in a mouse model of RA.
METHODS: Control and arthritic SKG/Jcl mice were injected with ICG alone or 
ICG-lactosomes and examined by NIR fluorescence imaging. Arthritis severity was 
assessed macroscopically and histopathologically.
RESULTS: ICG fluorescence was detected in the liver soon after injection and 
then decreased over the next several hours. ICG was not detected in the joints 
of control or arthritic mice. In contrast, ICG-lactosomes remained in mice for 
at least 48 h and accumulated specifically at inflamed joints. ICG-lactosome 
fluorescence was higher in arthritic versus normal joints at all times examined 
and was maximal at 24 h after injection.
CONCLUSIONS: NIR fluorescence imaging of ICG-lactosomes detects arthritic joints 
in a mouse model of RA. ICG-lactosomes may preferentially localize to inflamed 
joints via enhanced permeability and retention.
