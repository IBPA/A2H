This report shows that interleukin (IL) 17-producing T helper type 17 (Th17) 
cells predominantly express CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 6 in an animal model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Th17 cells induced in vivo in normal mice via 
homeostatic proliferation similarly express CCR6, whereas those inducible in 
vitro by transforming growth factor beta and IL-6 additionally need IL-1 and 
neutralization of interferon (IFN) gamma and IL-4 for CCR6 expression. Forced 
expression of RORgamma t, a key transcription factor for Th17 cell 
differentiation, induces not only IL-17 but also CCR6 in naive T cells. 
Furthermore, Th17 cells produce CCL20, the known ligand for CCR6. Synoviocytes 
from arthritic joints of mice and humans also produce a large amount of CCL20, 
with a significant correlation (P = 0.014) between the amounts of IL-17 and 
CCL20 in RA joints. The CCL20 production by synoviocytes is augmented in vitro 
by IL-1beta, IL-17, or tumor necrosis factor alpha, and is suppressed by 
IFN-gamma or IL-4. Administration of blocking anti-CCR6 monoclonal antibody 
substantially inhibits mouse arthritis. Thus, the joint cytokine milieu formed 
by T cells and synovial cells controls the production of CCL20 and, 
consequently, the recruitment of CCR6+ arthritogenic Th17 cells to the inflamed 
joints. These results indicate that CCR6 expression contributes to Th17 cell 
function in autoimmune disease, especially in autoimmune arthritis such as RA.
