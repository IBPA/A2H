BACKGROUND: The broad immunological gap between inbred SPF-raised strains of 
mice and rats and the diverse rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient population 
limits the predictive value of the existing disease models for clinical success 
of new therapies, in particular for those using highly specific biologicals.
OBJECTIVE: This review argues that because of their closer immunological and 
physiological proximity to patients, disease models in non-human primates (NHPs) 
may bridge this gap and help reduce the failure of many (Â± 80%) new therapies in 
clinical trials. In various research areas, NHPs are an accepted intermediate 
between disease models in rodents and the ultimate introduction for clinical use 
in patients. However, with the exception of transplantation, this is not the 
case for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as RA, although useful 
preclinical models are being developed.
METHOD: The validity and use of the rhesus monkey model of collagen-induced 
arthritis as a preclinical RA model is reviewed. The discussion comprises 
present genetic and immunological aspects, biomarkers, and an overview of 
published preclinical therapy evaluations.
CONCLUSION: It is time to consider the use of NHPs with a greater evolutionary 
proximity to humans as models for preclinical evaluation of new human-specific 
drugs for arthritic disease.
