OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe expression of parathyroid 
hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a 
well-established animal model for rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: CIA was induced in female dark agouti rats. Inguinal (ILNs) and 
popliteal (PLNs) lymph nodes and distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) were 
retrieved at different time points. Tissues were processed for detection of 
PTHrP and cell marker proteins by immunohistochemistry. Lymph node RNA was 
extracted, and PTHrP mRNA quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Hyperplasia of ILNs was observed 2 days after injection, coinciding 
with the peak in PTHrP expression in ILNs (1240 +/- 373 gene copies/ng RNA vs 
normal 339 +/- 120, P < 0.05). Hyperplasia of PLNs was first seen at 1 day after 
onset of arthritis, coinciding with the peak in PTHrP expression in PLNs (2267 
+/- 697 vs normal 781 +/- 136, P < 0.01). PTHrP expression in PLNs remained 
increased 5 days after onset (1361 +/- 302 vs normal 781 +/- 136, P < 0.05). In 
both PLNs and ILNs PTHrP protein was localized to high endothelial venules, 
lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. In DIP joint synovium PTHrP staining was 
first detected on day 10 after onset, and was most abundant at day 20 after 
onset, at sites of bone resorption and deposition, where it was localized to 
neutrophils, cells of monocyte lineage and osteoblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ILN and PLN PTHrP mRNA expression suggest that elevated 
levels of the cytokine are associated with aggravation of the inflammatory 
immune response. Changes in PTHrP in DIP joints indicate its involvement in late 
rather than early pathogenic events in CIA joints.
