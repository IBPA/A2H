TLRs may contribute to the progression of rheumatoid arthritis through 
recognition of microbial or host-derived ligands found in arthritic joints. 
Here, we show that TLR2 and TLR4, but not TLR9, are involved in the pathogenesis 
of autoimmune arthritis and play distinct roles in the regulation of T cells and 
cytokines. We investigated the involvement of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 in the 
progression of arthritis using IL-1 receptor antagonist-knockout (IL1rn-/-) 
mice, which spontaneously develop an autoimmune T cell-mediated arthritis. 
Spontaneous onset of arthritis was dependent on TLR activation by microbial 
flora, as germ-free mice did not develop arthritis. Clinical and 
histopathological evaluation of IL1rn-/-Tlr2-/- mice revealed more severe 
arthritis, characterized by reduced suppressive function of Tregs and 
substantially increased IFN-gamma production by T cells. IL1rn-/-Tlr4-/- mice 
were, in contrast, protected against severe arthritis and had markedly lower 
numbers of Th17 cells and a reduced capacity to produce IL-17. A lack of Tlr9 
did not affect the progression of arthritis. While any therapeutic intervention 
targeting TLR2 still seems complicated, the strict position of TLR4 upstream of 
a number of pathogenic cytokines including IL-17 provides an interesting 
potential therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis.
