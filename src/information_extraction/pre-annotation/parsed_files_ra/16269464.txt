Two receptors [estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta] mediate the manifold 
effects of estrogens throughout the body. Although a clear role has been 
established for ERalpha in the classical effects of estrogen activity, the 
physiological role of ERbeta is less well understood. A small-molecule ERbeta 
selective agonist, ERB-041, has potent antiinflammatory activity in the Lewis 
rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis. To characterize the response of target 
organs and pathways responsible for this antiinflammatory effect, mRNA 
expression profiling of the spleen, lymph node, and liver was performed, in 
conjunction with a global analysis of the plasma proteome. We find that the 
expression of a large number of genes and proteins are altered in the disease 
model and the majority of these are partially or fully reversed by ERB-041 
treatment. Regulated pathways include the acute-phase response, eicosanoid 
synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and iron metabolism. In addition, many of the 
regulated genes and proteins are known to be dysregulated in human rheumatoid 
arthritis, providing further evidence that the manifestations of the Lewis rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis model bear similarity to the human disease.
