BACKGROUND: We investigated two distinct synovial fibroblast populations that 
were located preferentially in the lining or sub-lining layers and defined by 
their expression of either podoplanin (PDPN) or CD248, and explored their 
ability to undergo self-assembly and transmigration in vivo.
METHODS: Synovial fibroblasts (SF) were cultured in vitro and phenotypic changes 
following stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were examined. To examine the phenotype 
of SF in vivo, a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) human-mouse model of 
cartilage destruction was utilised.
RESULTS: SF in the lining layer in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) expressed high 
levels of PDPN compared to the normal synovium, whereas CD248 expression was 
restricted to sub-lining layer cells. TNF-α or IL1 stimulation in vitro resulted 
in an increased expression of PDPN. In contrast, stimulation with TGF-β1 induced 
CD248 expression. In the SCID human-mouse model, rheumatoid SF recapitulated the 
expression of PDPN and CD248. Fibroblasts adjacent to cartilage expressed PDPN, 
and attached to, invaded, and degraded cartilage. PDPN+ CD248- SF preceded the 
appearance of PDPN- CD248+ cells in contralateral implants.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified two distinct SF populations identified by 
expression of either PDPN or CD248 which are located within different anatomical 
compartments of the inflamed synovial membrane. These markers discriminate 
between SF subsets with distinct biological properties. As PDPN-expressing cells 
are associated with early fibroblast migration and cartilage erosion in vivo, we 
propose that PDPN-expressing cells may be an attractive therapeutic target in 
RA.
