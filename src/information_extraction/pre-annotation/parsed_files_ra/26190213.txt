The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential of water-in-oil-in-water 
(w/o/w) and solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) emulsification techniques to prepare 
the altered collagen type II peptide AP268-270 (ACTP)-loaded 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres to make ACTP more convenient 
as an rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Microspheres produced by the s/o/w method 
had higher drug encapsulation efficiency (69.7-79.8%) than those prepared by the 
w/o/w method (21.8-39.3%). In vitro drug release was influenced by the 
microencapsulation technique, molecular weight, and composition of the polymer. 
After intramuscular injection of the optimal formulation to Lewis rats, the 
concentration of ACTP peptide in serum reached its maximum level on day 3 and 
then remained nearly stable for approximately 4 weeks. In a collagen-induced 
arthritis rat model, a single intramuscular injection of ACTP-loaded PLGA 
microspheres had comparable efficacy to the intravenous injection of ACTP 
peptide solution once every other day.
