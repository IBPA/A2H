Clinically, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic deforming disease 
characterized mainly by joint swelling and destruction. Although synovial 
inflammation and bone erosion are the hallmarks of this disease, the 
presentation of various features between patients is clearly heterogenous, 
suggesting that there are different variants of RA. Hence, the development of an 
animal model that has all of the elements of human RA has remained elusive. This 
review explores several different views on the etiology of RA and the recent 
data from various murine arthritis models which provide support for these 
theories. In addition to discussing the potential roles of CD4(+) T cell 
activation, autoantibodies, and lymphocyte-independent cytokine production, the 
role of CD4(+) T regulatory cells will be presented in the context of a newly 
developed humanized transgenic mouse model. This novel T cell receptor 
transgenic model is being characterized to enhance our understanding of the 
mechanisms involved in the breach of self-tolerance that occurs in autoimmune 
disorders such as RA.
