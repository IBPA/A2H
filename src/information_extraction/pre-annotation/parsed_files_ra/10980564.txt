OBJECTIVE: To correlate the clinical and radiographic changes at different 
stages of experimentally-induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the TMJ.
METHODS: Forty eight adult male guinea pigs, aged 4-6 months, were divided into 
two groups. Arthritis was induced in the experimental animals by intraperitoneal 
injection of heat-inactivated group A Streptococcus pyogenes. Four animals from 
each group were sacrificed and examined clinically and radiographically at 
intervals of 48 h and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.
RESULTS: The main clinical findings were stiffness, crepitation and reduction in 
mouth opening. Radiographically, the main features were condylar erosion, 
flattening and sclerosis subcortical cyst formation.
CONCLUSION: RA passes through stages that can be correlated clinically and 
radiographically. Both the clinical and radiographic manifestations in this 
experimental model are comparable with those previously reported in the small 
joints of humans.
