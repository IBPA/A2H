Our understanding of the role of T cells in human disease is undergoing revision 
as a result of the discovery of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, a unique CD4(+) T-cell 
subset characterized by production of interleukin-17 (IL-17). IL-17 is a highly 
inflammatory cytokine with robust effects on stromal cells in many tissues. 
Recent data in humans and mice suggest that Th17 cells play an important role in 
the pathogenesis of a diverse group of immune-mediated diseases, including 
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, 
and asthma. Initial reports also propose a role for Th17 cells in tumorigenesis 
and transplant rejection. Important differences, as well as many similarities, 
are emerging when the biology of Th17 cells in the mouse is compared with 
corresponding phenomena in humans. As our understanding of human Th17 biology 
grows, the mechanisms underlying many diseases are becoming more apparent, 
resulting in a new appreciation for both previously known and more recently 
discovered cytokines, chemokines, and feedback mechanisms. Given the strong 
association between excessive Th17 activity and human disease, new therapeutic 
approaches targeting Th17 cells are highly promising, but the potential safety 
of such treatments may be limited by the role of these cells in normal host 
defenses against infection.
