Anacardic acid, which is abundant in nutshell of Anacardium occidentale, has 
multiple pharmacological activities. In this study, we examined the therapeutic 
potential of anacardic acid in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We explored 
the effects of anacardic acid on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and on 
the proliferation and invasion of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs). The 
underlying molecular mechanism was investigated. Anacardic acid treatment 
markedly suppressed paw swelling, joint destruction, and arthritis scores in CIA 
mice. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) and 
interleutkin-1beta (IL- 1β) were significantly lowered by anacardic acid. In 
vitro assays demonstrated that anacardic acid impaired the proliferation and 
invasion abilities of RA-FLSs in the presence of TNF- α or IL- 1β. Western blot 
analysis revealed the reduction of Akt protein expression and phoshporylation in 
RA-FLSs by anacardic acid. However, the mRNA level of Akt remained unchanged. 
Anacardic acid treatment significantly increased the expression of miR-633 in 
RA-FLSs. Akt was identified as a novel target of miR-633. Overexpression of 
miR-633 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of RA-FLSs, which 
was rescued by enforced expression of Akt. Depletion of miR-633 prevented 
anacardic acid-mediated suppression of proliferation and invasion of RA-FLSs, 
which was accompanied by increased expression of Akt protein. In conclusion, 
anacardic acid may serve as a promising agent in the treatment of RA.
