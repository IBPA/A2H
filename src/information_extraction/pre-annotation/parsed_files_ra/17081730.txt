Peptidomimetic compounds that bind to major histocompatibility complex class II 
molecules and are resistant to cathepsins can competitively inhibit the 
presentation of processed protein antigens. Therefore, compounds that bind to 
autoimmune disease-associated class II molecules are expected to compete with 
autoantigens for presentation and thereby interrupt the disease process. The 
first generation of such competitors developed for rheumatoid 
arthritis-associated HLA-DR molecules, although resistant to cathepsins, has 
remained sensitive to plasma proteases, and was thus unlikely to be effective in 
vivo. We have therefore produced a second generation of compounds that are 
resistant to cathepsins and stable in plasma while maintaining binding affinity 
for HLA-DR molecules associated with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 
sclerosis. Selected compounds of this series are shown to inhibit antigen 
presentation in vivo, as well as effectively treat collagen induced arthritis 
and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in HLA-DR transgenic mouse models.
