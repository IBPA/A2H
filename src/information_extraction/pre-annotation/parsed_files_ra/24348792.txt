Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling autoimmune disease with 
characteristics of chronic, progressive inflammatory joint synovial damage, 
which mainly encroaches upon the synovium of the joint. The use of traditional 
medicine to treat RA slows the development of RA to a certain extent; however, 
it often has numerous side-effects. Therefore, the focus of RA research is the 
identification of a new, safe and effective medicine. The aim of the present 
study was to use an ultra performance liquid chromatography and photo diode 
array (UPLC-PDA) method to detect the paeoniflorin component in a Radix Paeoniae 
Alba decoction and in rat plasma following the oral administration of Radix 
Paeoniae Alba decoction. In addition, the effects of paeoniflorin on 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats were investigated. The results indicate 
that a UPLC-PDA method for determining the presence of paeoniflorin in the Radix 
Paeoniae Alba decoction was successfully established. The method was fast, 
simple, sensitive, precise and valid. Paeoniflorin was shown to be a bioactive 
component of the Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction that was absorbed into rat 
plasma. Paeoniflorin significantly improved the disease resistant ability of RA 
rats and reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, 
thereby inhibiting inflammation and bone erosion in the rats with CIA. The 
observations are likely to lay the foundation for further study of the mechanism 
of paeoniflorin in the treatment of RA.
