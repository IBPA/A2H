CD2 and CD58 are two important costimulatory molecules involved in generating 
the signal II required for normal immune signaling. However, this interaction 
can be targeted to be of benefit in cases of abnormal immune signaling seen in 
autoimmune diseases. Our objective in this study was to design a peptidomimetic 
(compound 7) based on a β-strand structure of the adhesion domain of CD2 protein 
to inhibit CD2-CD58 protein-protein interaction and its effect on 
immunomodulation in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. The ability of 
compound 7 to bind to CD58 protein was assessed using flow cytometry. The effect 
of compound 7 on modulating the immune response was evaluated in an autoimmune 
disease using CIA in mice. The stability of compound 7 was evaluated in mouse 
serum using mass spectrometry. Antibody (Ab) binding inhibition studies 
suggested that compound 7 binds to CD58 protein. Compound 7 was successful in 
modulating immune responses when administered in the CIA mouse model along with 
reducing anti-collagen Ab levels and decreasing the level of interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) relative to control treatments. Compound 7 was found to be 
nonimmunogenic and stable in mouse serum up to 48 h. Results suggest that 
compound 7 can serve as a lead compound for immunomodulation, and could be a 
therapeutic agent for the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
