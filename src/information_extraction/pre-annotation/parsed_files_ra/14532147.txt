Studies in mouse infection models clearly demonstrate tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF) to be a critical component of both the antibacterially protective and the 
inflammatory immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is therefore not 
surprising that treatment of patients-for example, those with rheumatoid 
arthritis-with biological agents interfering with TNF activity have shown an 
increased risk of reactivating tuberculosis. However, conceivably, TNF targeting 
biological agents can be developed that because of their particular mode of 
action and their specific pharmacodynamics may be less likely to have this side 
effect.
