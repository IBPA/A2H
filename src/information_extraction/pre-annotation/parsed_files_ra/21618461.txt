OBJECTIVE: To investigate the uptake of a poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (generation 
5 [G5]) nanoparticle covalently conjugated to polyvalent folic acid (FA) as the 
targeting ligand into macrophages, and to investigate the activity of an FA- and 
methotrexate (MTX)-conjugated dendrimer (G5-FA-MTX) as a therapeutic for the 
inflammatory disease of arthritis.
METHODS: In vitro studies were performed in macrophage cell lines and in 
isolated mouse macrophages to check the cellular uptake of fluorescence-tagged 
G5-FA nanoparticles, using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo 
studies were conducted in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis to evaluate 
the therapeutic potential of G5-FA-MTX.
RESULTS: Folate-targeted dendrimer bound and internalized in a receptor-specific 
manner into both folate receptor Î²-expressing macrophage cell lines and primary 
mouse macrophages. The conjugate G5-FA-MTX acted as a potent antiinflammatory 
agent and reduced arthritis-induced parameters of inflammation such as ankle 
swelling, paw volume, cartilage damage, bone resorption, and body weight 
decrease.
CONCLUSION: The use of folate-targeted nanoparticles to specifically target MTX 
into macrophages may provide an effective clinical approach for antiinflammatory 
therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.
