The HLA-DRB1*0401 MHC class II molecule (DR4) is genetically associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis. It has been proposed that this MHC class II molecule 
participates in disease pathogenesis by presenting arthritogenic endogenous or 
exogenous peptides to CD4+ T cells, leading to their activation and resulting in 
an inflammatory response within the synovium. In order to better understand DR4 
restricted T cell activation, we analyzed the candidate arthritogenic antigens 
type II collagen, human aggrecan, and the hepatitis B surface antigen for T-cell 
epitopes using a predictive model for determining peptide-DR4 affinity. We also 
applied this model to determine whether cross-reactive T-cell epitopes can be 
predicted based on known MHC-peptide-TCR interactions. Using the HLA-DR4-IE 
transgenic mouse, we showed that both T-cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine 
production (IFN-gamma) correlate with the predicted affinity of a peptide for 
DR4. In addition, we provide evidence that TCR recognition of a peptide-DR4 
complex is highly specific in that similar antigenic peptide sequences, 
containing identical amino acids at TCR contact positions, do not activate the 
same population of T cells.
