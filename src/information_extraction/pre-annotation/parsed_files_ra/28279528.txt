In a pursuit to identify reversible and selective BTK inhibitors, two series 
based on 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine and 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine as the hinge 
binding core, have been identified. Structure activity relationship (SAR) 
exploration led to identification of two advanced lead molecules, 11 and 13, 
which demonstrated desired BTK inhibitory potency in different cellular assays, 
excellent selectivity in a panel of 50 diverse kinases, favorable in vivo PK 
properties in mice and anti-arthritic effect in a mouse model of CIA.
