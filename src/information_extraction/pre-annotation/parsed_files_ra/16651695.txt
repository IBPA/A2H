Adjuvant-induced arthritic (AIA) rats develop a severe chronic polyarthritis 
which shares some features in common with human rheumatoid arthritis. The 
purpose of the present study was to examine whether AIA rats emit ultrasonic 
vocalizations (USVs) when they are confronted with a healthy 'stimulus rat' in 
social interactions. We also examined the effects of three analgesic drugs 
(piroxicam, rofecoxib and ketoprofen) on USV responses using the same paradigm. 
In social interactions, AIA rats and intact controls emitted USVs in the 22-28 
kHz range. Vocalization activities were significantly higher in AIA rats than 
those in intact controls. Moreover, the USVs of AIA rats were significantly 
inhibited by the three analgesic drugs. These results suggest that the USV 
responses elicited in AIA rats are useful for the evaluation of analgesic drugs.
