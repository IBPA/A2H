Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial immune disease exhibiting diverse 
clinical responses to specific therapeutic agents. Such heterogeneity reflects 
variable activation of signaling pathways. Consequently, RA physiopathology has 
been linked to many immune cells and factors, with controversial observations 
for interferons (IFNs). In this opinion article, we review the roles of these 
cytokines and the cells that produce them in light of recent data: clinical 
observations showing that expression of IFN-dependent genes does not reflect RA 
activity and RA mouse models in which the stimulation of IFN-dependent pathways 
provided disease protection. We suggest that epicutaneous stimulation of the IFN 
network is an attractive possibility to limit neutrophil infiltration or 
activation, thus providing therapeutic benefits to RA patients refractory to 
current therapies.
