OBJECTIVE: Macrophages are critical in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). We recently demonstrated that FLIP is necessary for the differentiation 
and/or survival of macrophages. We also showed that FLIP is highly expressed in 
RA synovial macrophages. This study was undertaken to determine if a reduction 
in FLIP in mouse macrophages reduces synovial tissue macrophages and ameliorates 
serum-transfer arthritis.
METHODS: Mice with Flip deleted in myeloid cells (Flipf/f LysMc/+ mice) and 
littermate controls were used. Arthritis was induced by intraperitoneal 
injection of K/BxN serum. Disease severity was evaluated by clinical score and 
change in ankle thickness, and joints were examined by histology and 
immunohistochemistry. Cells were isolated from the ankles and bone marrow of the 
mice and examined by flow cytometry, real-time quantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or Western blotting.
RESULTS: In contrast to expectations, Flipf/f LysMc/+ mice developed more severe 
arthritis early in the clinical course, but peak arthritis was attenuated and 
the resolution phase more complete than in control mice. Prior to the induction 
of serum-transfer arthritis, the number of tissue-resident macrophages was 
reduced. On day 9 after arthritis induction, the number of F4/80high macrophages 
in the joints of the Flipf/f LysMc/+ mice was not decreased, but increased. FLIP 
was reduced in the F4/80high macrophages in the ankles of the Flipf/f LysMc/+ 
mice, while F4/80high macrophages expressed an antiinflammatory phenotype in 
both the Flipf/f LysMc/+ and control mice.
CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that reducing FLIP in macrophages by 
increasing the number of antiinflammatory macrophages may be an effective 
therapeutic approach to suppress inflammation, depending on the disease stage.
