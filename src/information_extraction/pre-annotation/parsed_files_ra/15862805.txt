We investigated the efficacy of celecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 
inhibitor, on arthritic pathophysiology and confirmed its gastric safety in 
adjuvant-induced arthritis rats. Results were compared with those for 
loxoprofen, a non-selective COX inhibitor. Arthritis was induced by injection of 
1 mg of Mycobacterium butyricum in 50 microl of liquid paraffin into the left 
footpad of Lewis rats. The drugs were given by twice daily oral administration 
for 10 days beginning 15 days after adjuvant injection, with celecoxib at 0.01-3 
mg/kg/day and loxoprofen at 0.01-3 mg/kg/day. Celecoxib significantly inhibited 
paw swelling, hyperalgesic response, and joint destruction (radiographic and 
histopathological findings) in these arthritic rats. These effects of celecoxib 
were superior to those of loxoprofen. Further, the administration of loxoprofen 
(3 mg/kg/day) caused significant gastric lesions, whereas celecoxib at the same 
dose did not. These results suggest that COX-2-mediated prostaglandins may play 
an important role in the progression of pathophysiology in this model and that 
celecoxib may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, with greater safety than non-selective COX inhibitors.
