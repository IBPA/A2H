Chemical lead 2 (CL2) is the first non-sphingosine-1-phosphate (Sph-1-P) analog 
type antagonist of endothelial differentiation gene-1 (Edg-1/S1P(1)), which is a 
member of the Sph-1-P receptor family. CL2 inhibits [(3)H]Sph-1-P/S1P(1) binding 
and shows concentration-dependent inhibition activity against both intracellular 
cAMP concentration decrease and cell invasion induced by the Sph-1-P/S1P(1) 
pathway. It also inhibits normal tube formation in an angiogenesis culture 
model, indicating that CL2 has anti-angiogenesis activity. This compound 
improved the disease conditions in two angiogenic models in vivo. It 
significantly inhibited angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth 
factor in a rabbit cornea model as well as the swelling of mouse feet in an 
anti-type II collagen antibody-induced arthritis model. These results indicate 
that the Sph-1-P/S1P(1) pathway would have an important role in disease-related 
angiogenesis, especially in the processes of migration/invasion and tube 
formation. In addition, CL2 would be a powerful tool for the pharmacological 
study of the mechanisms of the Sph-1-P/S1P(1) pathway in rheumatoid arthritis, 
diabetes retinopathy, and solid tumor growth processes.
