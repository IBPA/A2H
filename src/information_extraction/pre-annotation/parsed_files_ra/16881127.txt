Mast cells have been linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are essential to 
the pathogenesis of RA-like disease in a mouse model. We describe a 34-year-old 
woman who developed Sj√∂gren's syndrome concurrently with telangiectasia 
macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP), a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis. The 
patient had sicca symptoms with an abnormal minor salivary gland biopsy and 
decreased salivary flow, peripheral neuropathy, an 80 pound weight loss, and a 
macular erythematous rash that exhibited superficial perivascular mast cell 
infiltrates on biopsy of lesional skin. This case further underscores the link 
between mast cells and the development of autoimmunity.
