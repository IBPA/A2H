BACKGROUND: Aconitum plants have been widely used in China for thousands of 
years. Recent evidences indicate that aconitine, the main active ingredient of 
Aconitum, has immunomodulatory properties that might be useful for treating 
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we conducted a 
pilot study to explore the effect and mechanisms of aconitine on the treatment 
of systemic lupus erythematosus.
METHODS: A pristane-induced murine model was used. The pristane-induced mice 
were treated with aconitine (25, 75 μg kg-1 d-1, po) for 9 weeks. Every three 
weeks, proteinuria was detected to monitor the kidney damage and blood was 
collected to measure serum levels of autoantibodies, besides the kidney 
pathological examination. The major B cell activating factor and major 
pro-inflammatory mediators, PGE2, IL-17a and IL-6, were also detected.
RESULTS: We found that aconitine significantly improved the mouse health, 
decreased the elevated blood leukocyte counts, reduced the serum level of 
anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, greatly ameliorated renal 
histopathologic damage and reduced IgG deposit in glomerular. Furtherly, the 
levels of PGE2, IL-17a and IL-6, were found to have decreased in aconitine 
treated mice.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that aconitine can inhibit the progression of 
disease and ameliorate the pathologic lesion of systemic lupus erythematosus.
