Self-reactive T cells with low signalling capacity through the T-cell receptor 
were recently observed in the SKG mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
have been linked to a spontaneous mutation in the ZAP-70 signal transduction 
molecule. Here we hypothesize that similar mechanisms also drive RA, associated 
with an abnormal innate and adaptive immune response driven by nuclear 
factor-kappaB activation and tumour necrosis factor secretion. Similar to the 
essential role played by pathogens in SKG mice, we propose that HLA-associated 
immunity to chronic viral infection is a key factor in the immune dysregulation 
and joint inflammation that characterize RA.
