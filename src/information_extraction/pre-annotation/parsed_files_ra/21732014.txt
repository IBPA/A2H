BACKGROUND: KRN/I-A(g7) (KxB/N) is a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, 
which resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis in these animals is caused 
by autoreactivity to a ubiquitously expressed autoantigen, glucose-6 phosphate 
isomerase. Tolerance is broken at both the T cell and B cell level. The sera 
from KRN/I-A(g7) mice can induce mouse arthritis in healthy mice. Complement 
components of the alternative complement pathway, including C3, have been shown 
to be required in induction of mouse arthritis by serum transfer.
METHODS: We have bred KRN/I-A(g7) mice onto a C3-deficient background and 
followed cohorts for the spontaneous appearance of arthritis. We have also 
transferred KxB/N serum to B6.I-A ( g7 ) recipients.
RESULTS: C3-deficient KRN/I-A(g7) mice spontaneously developed severe, 
destructive arthritis, comparable to that seen in C3-intact KRN/I-A(g7) mice. 
However, serum transfer experiments confirmed the strong requirement for C3 in 
the passive model.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of spontaneous KRN/I-A(g7) arthritis can largely 
proceed by complement-independent pathways and must have pathology effector 
mechanisms in addition to those seen in the passive serum transfer model.
