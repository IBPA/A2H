B cell targeted therapy using rituximab, a genetically engineered chimeric 
mouse/human monoclonal antibody, is recommended for patients with active 
rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to both conventional 
disease-modifying drugs and TNF inhibitors. The value of ritixumab in patients 
with earlier disease, who have only failed methotrexate, was evaluated in a 
large multicentre randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The Study Evaluating 
Rituximab's Efficacy in MTX iNadequate rEsponders (SERENE) trial enrolled 511 
patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. They received one of two doses of 
rituximab (500 mg × 2 or 1000 mg × 2) or placebo in addition to methotrexate 
therapy. By 6 months significantly more patients receiving active treatment with 
rituximab achieved American College of Rheumatology 20 and 50% responses and had 
low disease activity or remission. These benefits extended to 12 months. There 
was not an excess of adverse reactions with rituximab. There was some evidence, 
albeit incomplete, that patients who were seronegative for rheumatoid factor 
were less likely to respond to rituximab. There is some evidence rituximab might 
be suitable as first choice biologic treatment, although head-to-head trials are 
needed against TNF inhibitors before such an approach can be justified. Its 
value is likely to be restricted to seropositive patients.
