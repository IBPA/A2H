We propose a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) induced in outbred guinea pigs 
using a single subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant to the hind 
paw. Histological examination of this model shows fibrin deposition on the 
surface of the synovial membrane, leukocyte infiltration of the synovial 
membrane and adjacent tissues, proliferation of the granulation tissue, and 
emergence of angioid areas, characteristic of RA. The cell response appears as 
an increase in the plasma cell count and development of follicle-like lymphoid 
infiltrates; erosion of the articular surface of the cartilage, frequently with 
deep cartilage destruction over large areas; and epiphysiopathy. The high 
reproducibility of arthritis induction in this RA model has been demonstrated. 
The proposed model is promising for the assessment of anti-arthritis 
preparations and dosage regimens.
