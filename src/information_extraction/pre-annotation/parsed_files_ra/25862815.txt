Previous studies in mouse models of autoimmune diabetes and encephalomyelitis 
have indicated that the selective delivery of self-antigen to the endocytic 
receptor DEC205 on steady-state dendritic cells (DCs) may represent a suitable 
approach to induce Ag-specific immune tolerance. In this study, we aimed to 
examine whether DEC205(+) DC targeting of a single immunodominant peptide 
derived from human cartilage proteoglycan (PG) can promote immune tolerance in 
PG-induced arthritis (PGIA). Besides disease induction by immunization with 
whole PG protein with a high degree of antigenic complexity, PGIA substantially 
differs from previously studied autoimmune models not only in the target tissue 
of autoimmune destruction but also in the nature of pathogenic immune effector 
cells. Our results show that DEC205(+) DC targeting of the PG peptide 70-84 is 
sufficient to efficiently protect against PGIA development. Complementary 
mechanistic studies support a model in which DEC205(+) DC targeting leads to 
insufficient germinal center B cell support by PG-specific follicular helper T 
cells. Consequently, impaired germinal center formation results in lower Ab 
titers, severely compromising the development of PGIA. Overall, this study 
further corroborates the potential of prospective tolerogenic DEC205(+) DC 
vaccination to interfere with autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
