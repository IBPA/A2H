Autoantibodies represent a hallmark of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is a 
chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and damage 
in the joints. Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies (ACPA) are the most 
prominent autoantibodies present in RA patients. These autoantibodies have been 
intensively investigated during the last 20 years due to their diagnostic and 
predictive value. Furthermore, they are believed to be involved in mediating the 
damage associated with RA. Antibodies of the IgG isotype interact with the 
immune system via Fcγ receptors expressed on immune cells as well as nonimmune 
cells. These receptors, therefore, form the bridge between Fcγ receptor-positive 
cells and antibodies complexed to antigen allowing the modulation and activation 
of cellular immune responses that are involved in immune defense against 
invading microorganisms. However, in case triggered by antibodies against 
self-antigens, they can also play a pivotal role in the induction and 
perpetuation of autoimmune diseases such as RA. Mouse models have been 
indispensably important for understanding the role of Fcγ receptors in the 
development of arthritis. Here we discuss the contribution of autoantibodies to 
the pathogenesis of arthritis in preclinical animal models, as well as RA, in 
relation to their interaction with the different (immune inhibitory and 
activating) Fcγ receptors.
