AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and functional loading through diet modification on the 
structural conformation and the mechanical properties of the mandibular condyle 
in a transgenic mouse model and compare to healthy littermates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four-week-old hybrid male mice from mixed background 
CBAxC57BL/6 were used. Four groups of animals were formed consisting of five 
animals each, either presenting RA (transgenic line hTNF 197), or wild-type 
(control), half receiving ordinary (hard) diet and half receiving soft diet 
within each category. Following sacrifice, resin-embedded and metallographically 
polished condylar specimens were evaluated employing scanning electron 
microscopy/ Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and also tested for mechanical 
properties, through Vickers microhardness (HV100) measurements.
RESULTS: The multivariable analysis revealed significantly lower HV100 values 
for the RA groups after adjusting for diet (β = -10; 95% confidence interval: 
-16, -4; P = 0.001), while functional loading through diet modification did not 
appear as a significant predictor of the outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of compromised mechanical properties of the 
mandibular condylar bone for the diseased animals, whereas no association 
between functional loading and mechanical properties of the condyle could be 
established.
