AIM: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a pathological factor causing the 
characteristic symptoms of periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In this 
study, we describe the phenotypes of human TNF-α transgenic mice (hTNFtg) with 
respect to their periodontium and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Periodontal structures, TMJ and skull shape of hTNFtg mice 
and wild-type (WT) littermates were assessed by microcomputed tomography, 
automated segmentation, geometric morphometrics and histologic ground sections.
RESULTS: We show that hTNFtg mice have an eroded lamina dura and reduced 
periodontal ligament space compared to (WT) littermates. Transgenic mice further 
exhibit severe destruction of the TMJ. Geometric morphometrics revealed that 
hTNFtg mice have a more laterally positioned TMJ with a concomitantly enlarged 
zygomatic process. Mandibular and maxillary teeth occluded properly.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that chronic inflammation in hTNFtg mice 
causes destructive changes of the periodontium and the TMJ.
