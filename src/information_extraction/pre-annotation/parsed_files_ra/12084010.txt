Clinical trials showing the benefits of reducing the effects of TNF- alpha in 
rheumatoid arthritis have highlighted the key role of the cytokine TNF- alpha in 
this inflammatory condition. A new approach to reducing the effects of TNF- 
alpha is to decrease its synthesis by inhibiting TNF- alpha converting enzyme 
with GW3333. In rat models of arthritis, GW3333 has some beneficial effects. 
Further longer-term studies of GW3333 in animal models are required to determine 
whether its benefit is maintained. TACE inhibition may represent a new approach 
to treating inflammation.
