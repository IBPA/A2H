Bones cannot properly form or be maintained without cell-cell interactions 
through ephrin ligands and Eph receptors. Cell culture analysis and evaluation 
of genetic mouse models and human diseases reveal various ephrins and Eph 
functions in the skeletal system. Migration, attachment and spreading of 
mesenchymal stem cells are regulated by ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors. 
ephrinB1 loss-of-function is associated with craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS) 
in humans and mice. In bone remodeling, ephrinB2 is postulated to act as a 
"coupling stimulator." In that case, bidirectional signaling between 
osteoclastic ephrinB2 and osteoblastic EphB4 suppresses osteoclastic bone 
resorption and enhances osteoblastic bone formation, facilitating the transition 
between these two states. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces ephrinB2 in 
osteoblasts and enhances osteoblastic bone formation. In contrast to ephrinB2, 
ephrinA2 acts as a "coupling inhibitor," since ephrinA2 reverse signaling into 
osteoclasts enhances osteoclastogenesis and EphA2 forward signaling into 
osteoblasts suppresses osteoblastic bone formation and mineralization. 
Furthermore, ephrins and Ephs likely modulate pathological conditions such as 
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma. This 
review focuses on ephrin/Eph-mediated cell-cell interactions in bone biology.
