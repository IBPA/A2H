IL-21 is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates B cell and plasma cell 
differentiation and is thought be an autocrine factor for follicular helper T 
cell (T(FH)) and Th17 differentiation. Although IL-21 has been implicated in 
autoimmune diseases, its relevant cellular source and target cells have not been 
well characterized. We investigated this issue in the K/BxN mouse model of 
autoimmune arthritis. Adoptive transfer of KRN-transgenic CD4‚Å∫ T cells into 
appropriate hosts drives germinal center (GC) formation and autoantibody 
production against glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, leading to joint inflammation 
and destruction. By comparing transfer of T or B cells deficient in IL-21 or 
IL-21R, we were able to dissect the contribution of each cell type. T cells 
deficient in IL-21 did not induce GC formation or autoantibody production, but 
they went through normal T(FH) differentiation. However, T cells lacking IL-21R 
induced Ab titers, GC B cell frequency, and arthritis development similar to 
wild-type T cells, suggesting that IL-21 is not required for T(FH) 
differentiation and function. IL-21 acts on B cells, because IL-21R expression 
on B cells was required to induce disease. In contrast, Th17 cells, a T cell 
subset that also produces IL-21 and can provide help to B cells, are not 
required for the GC response and arthritis. These data have implications in 
developing effective therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and other Ab-mediated 
autoimmune diseases.
