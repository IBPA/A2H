Gelsemium elegans Benth. is a toxic plant that has been used as an ancient 
Chinese herbal remedy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and nervous pain, 
spasticity, skin ulcers, and cancers. Koumine, one of its representative 
alkaloids, shows numerous promising pharmacological activities, including 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Here, we investigated the analgesic 
effect of koumine on the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model of RA and 
explored the potential pharmacological mechanisms underlying the analgesia. In 
the CIA rats, repeated koumine treatments significantly reduced pain compared to 
controls and attenuated the collagen-induced increase in levels of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Cultured astrocytes showed 
reduced astrocyte reactivation and decreased production of both tested 
cytokines. Based on our results, koumine exerted both analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory effects on the CIA rat model that were apparently mediated by 
inhibiting astrocyte reactivation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
