The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of nanopowdered 
peanut sprout-added Caciocavallo cheese (NPCC) on the prevention and treatment 
of rheumatoid arthritis in DBA/IJ mice immunized with type II collagen. After 
the induction of arthritis, the mice were being divided into five groups: (1) 
normal, no immunization; (2) CIA, collagen-induced arthritis; (3) MTX, 
collagen-induced arthritis treated with methotrexate (0.3 mg/kg body weight); 
(4) CC, collagen-induced arthritis treated with Caciocavallo cheese (0.6 g/d); 
(5) NPCC, collagen-induced arthritis treated with nanopowdered peanut 
sprout-added Caciocavallo cheese (0.6 g/d). Nanopowdered peanut sprout was 
ranged from 300 to 350 nm, while regular powdered peanut sprouts were ranged 
from 50 to 150 μm. The NPCC group had considerable reductions of clinical scores 
and paw thicknesses at the end of experiment as compared to the CIA group. In 
the serum analysis, the TNF-α, IL-1β, IL- 6 and IgG1 levels in the NPCC group 
have decreased by 69.4, 75.9, 66.6, and 61.9%, respectively, when compared to 
the CIA group. The histological score and spleen index of the NPCC group were 
significantly lower than the CIA group. In conclusion, the feeding NPCC method 
could delay and/or prevent the rheumatoid arthritis in the collagen-induced 
arthritis mouse model. Based on this study, nanopowdered peanut sprouts could be 
applied to various functional cheeses.
