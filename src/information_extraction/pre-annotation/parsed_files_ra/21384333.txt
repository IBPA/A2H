OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism of action of interleukin-27 (IL-27) 
against rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Adenovirus containing IL-27 transcript was constructed and was locally 
delivered into the ankles of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
Progression of arthritis was determined in treated and untreated mice by 
measuring ankle circumference and through histologic analysis. IL-17 and its 
downstream targets as well as cytokines promoting Th17 cell differentiation were 
quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in CIA mouse ankles locally 
expressing adenoviral IL-27 as well as in control-treated mouse ankles. Ankles 
from both treatment groups were immunostained for neutrophil and monocyte 
migration (macrophages in the tissue). Finally, vascularization was quantified 
by histology and by determining ankle hemoglobin levels.
RESULTS: Ectopic expression of IL-27 in CIA mice ameliorated inflammation, 
lining hypertrophy, and bone erosion as compared with control-treated CIA mice. 
Serum and joint levels of IL-17 were significantly reduced in the IL-27-treated 
group compared with the control-treated group. Two of the main cytokines that 
induce Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 downstream target molecules were 
greatly down-regulated in CIA mouse ankles receiving forced expression of IL-27. 
The control mice had higher levels of vascularization and monocyte trafficking 
than did mice ectopically expressing IL-27.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that increased levels of IL-27 relieve arthritis 
in CIA mouse ankles. This amelioration of arthritis involves a reduction in CIA 
mouse serum and joint levels of IL-17 and results in decreased IL-17-mediated 
monocyte recruitment and angiogenesis. Hence, the use of IL-27 may be a strategy 
for treatment of patients with RA.
