Progranulin (PGRN) was found to play an anti-inflammatory and protective role in 
both inflammatory and degenerative arthritis (Tang et al., Science 332:478-484, 
2011; Zhao et al., Ann Rheum Dis 74:2244-2253, 2015). We recently published a 
visualized protocol to demonstrate a surgically-induced mouse model for 
examining the protective role of PGRN in degenerative osteoarthritis (Zhao et 
al., J Vis Exp:e50924, 2014). Herein we describe a modified collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of 
PGRN in inflammatory arthritis. CIA model is the most commonly used autoimmune 
model of inflammatory arthritis which shares both immunological and pathological 
features with human rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune inflammatory arthritis is 
induced by immunization with an emulsion of complete Freund's adjuvant and 
chicken type II collagen (CII) using a modified procedure in PGRN deficient mice 
and control littermates. Using the protocol described here, the investigator 
should be able to reproducibly induce a high incidence of CIA in PGRN deficient 
mice and also learn how to critically evaluate the severity and incidence of 
this disease model.
