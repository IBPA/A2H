OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased cardiovascular 
risk, secondary to endothelial dysfunction. There is accumulating evidence that 
methotrexate reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis, but the 
mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the 
effect of methotrexate on endothelial function and traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model.
METHODS: On the first signs of arthritis, methotrexate (1 mg/kg/week, s.c.) or 
saline (Vehicle) was administered to AIA for 3 weeks. Endothelial function was 
studied in aortic rings relaxed with acetylcholine in the presence or not of 
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, arginase, EDHF and 
superoxide anions production. Arthritis and radiological scores, blood pressure 
and blood levels of cytokines, triglycerides, cholesterol, homocysteine and 
BMP-4 were measured.
RESULTS: Although methotrexate significantly reduced the arthritis score, it had 
no effect on Ach-induced relaxation. As regards mechanisms, methotrexate 
increased nitric oxide synthase activity and reduced the superoxide anions 
production but did not change arginase, cyclooxygenase-2 and EDHF pathways. 
Methotrexate did not change the radiological score or blood pressure, lipid, 
glucose and homocysteine levels. By contrast, methotrexate significantly reduced 
plasma IL-1β and TNF-α levels and increased serum BMP-4 level.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction of clinical and biological inflammation, 
methotrexate did not improve endothelial function in AIA rats. Overall data 
suggest that mechanisms other than the ED reduction are likely involved, and 
remain to be elucidated to better understand the cardiovascular benefits of 
methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.
