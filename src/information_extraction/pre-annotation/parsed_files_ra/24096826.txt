Synovial fibroblast proliferation is a hallmark of the invasive pannus in the 
rheumatoid joint. Activated protein C (APC) is a natural anticoagulant that 
exerts antiinflammatory and cyto-protective effects in various diseases via 
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and proteinase-activated receptor 
(PAR)-mediated pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect and the 
underlying cellular signaling mechanisms of APC on proliferation of human 
rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSFs). We found that APC stimulated 
proliferation of mouse dermal fibroblasts (MDFs) and normal human dermal 
fibroblasts (HDFs) by up to 60%, but robustly downregulated proliferation of 
RSFs. APC induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein 
kinase (ERK) and enhanced expression of p21 and p27 in a dose-dependent manner 
in RSFs. The latter effect was inhibited by pre-treatment with the ERK 
inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 but not by p38 inhibitor SB203580. In addition, APC 
significantly downregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)Î±-stimulated cell 
proliferation and activation of p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt in 
RSFs. These results provide the first evidence that APC selectively inhibits 
proliferation and the inflammatory signaling pathways of RSFs. Thus, APC may 
reduce synovial hyperplasia and pannus invasion in rheumatoid arthritis.
