Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease and its 
pathogenesis remains unclear. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase 
interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2) is an adaptor protein, which is associated with 
auto-inflammatory disease. In this study, we selected adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(AIA) as animal model to study the role of PSTPIP2 in FLSs. We found that the 
expression of PSTPIP2 was significantly down-regulated in synovial tissues and 
FLSs of AIA rat compared with normal group. And overexpression of PSTPIP2 could 
inhibit the proliferation and inflammatory response of FLSs. Moreover, the 
proliferation and inflammatory response of FLSs were promoted with PSTPIP2 
silencing treatment. In terms of mechanism, we found that the expression of 
PSTPIP2 was closely related to NF-κB signaling pathway. Overall, our results 
suggested that PSTPIP2 inhibits the proliferation and inflammatory response of 
FLSs, which might be closely related to NF-κB signaling pathway.
