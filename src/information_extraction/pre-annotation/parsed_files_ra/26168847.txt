Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful, chronic disorder and there is currently 
an unmet need for effective therapies that will benefit a wide range of 
patients. The research and development process for therapies and treatments 
currently involves in vivo studies, which have the potential to cause 
discomfort, pain or distress. This Working Group report focuses on identifying 
causes of suffering within commonly used mouse and rat 'models' of RA, 
describing practical refinements to help reduce suffering and improve welfare 
without compromising the scientific objectives. The report also discusses other, 
relevant topics including identifying and minimising sources of variation within 
in vivo RA studies, the potential to provide pain relief including analgesia, 
welfare assessment, humane endpoints, reporting standards and the potential to 
replace animals in RA research.
