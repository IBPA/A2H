Autoantibody formation is essential for the development of certain autoimmune 
diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-type II collagen (CII) antibodies 
are found in RA patients; they interact with cartilage in vivo and are often 
highly pathogenic in the mouse. Autoreactivity to CII is directed to multiple 
epitopes and conserved between mice and humans. We have previously mapped the 
antibody response to CII in a heterogeneous stock cohort of mice, with a strong 
association with the IgH locus. We positioned the genetic polymorphisms and 
determined the structural requirements controlling antibody recognition of one 
of the major CII epitopes. Polymorphisms at positions S31R and W33T of the 
associated variable heavy chain (VH) allele were identified and confirmed by 
gene sequencing. The Fab fragment binding the J1 epitope was crystallized, and 
site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of those two variants for 
antigen recognition. Back mutation to germline sequence provided evidence for a 
preexisting recognition of the J1 epitope. These data demonstrate a genetic 
association of epitope-specific antibody responses with specific VH alleles, and 
it highlights the importance of germline-encoded antibodies in the pathogenesis 
of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.
