DING proteins comprise an intriguing phosphate-binding protein family present in 
all animal phyla. Five different DING representatives have been described in 
humans. Eukaryotic DING proteins are mostly involved in cellular processes such 
as cell cycle regulation, and also in pathological process such as rheumatoid 
arthritis and kidney stone formation. Although these proteins are ubiquitous in 
eukaryotes, no relevant locus or ORF has yet been found in sequenced genomes. 
This lack of sequence information has considerably hampered functional and 
structural studies of these proteins, and has required the use of novel and 
original techniques such as ab initio protein sequencing based on a combination 
of X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Sub-Angstrom structural 
resolution has elucidated the molecular binding mechanism of phosphate ions by 
these high-affinity proteins. Immunohistochemical studies show that these 
proteins are present in a wide variety of mouse tissues. Some DING proteins, 
particularly human phosphate binding protein (HPBP), can inhibit HIV 
replication. This inhibition takes place at the transcriptional step, which is 
not targeted by any current antiretroviral drug. Initial studies suggest that 
HPBP warrants animal testing. This recent discovery opens new possibilities for 
the treatment of HIV infection.
