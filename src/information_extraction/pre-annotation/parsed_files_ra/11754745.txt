Binding of Fas ligand to Fas induces apoptosis. The Fas-Fas ligand system plays 
important roles in many biological processes, including the elimination of 
autoreactive lymphoid cells. The mouse anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody HFE7A 
(m-HFE7A), which induces apoptosis, has been humanized based on a structure 
predicted by homology modeling. A version of humanized HFE7A is currently under 
development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. For a deeper understanding of the protein engineering aspect of 
antibody humanization, for which information on the three-dimensional structure 
is essential, we determined the crystal structure of the m-HFE7A antigen-binding 
fragment (Fab) by X-ray crystallography at 2.5 A resolution. The main-chain 
conformation of the five loops in the six complementarity-determining regions 
(CDRs) was correctly predicted with root-mean-square deviations of 0.30-1.04 A 
based on a comparison of the crystal structure with the predicted structure. The 
CDR-H3 conformation of the crystal structure, which was not classified as one of 
the canonical structures, was completely different from that of the predicted 
structure but adopted the conformation which followed the "H3-rules." The 
results of charge distribution analysis of the antigen-binding site suggest that 
electrostatic interactions may be important for its binding to Fas.
