BLyS and APRIL have similar but distinct biological roles, mediated through two 
known TNF receptor family members, TACI and BCMA. We show that mice treated with 
TACI-Ig and TACI-Ig transgenic mice have fewer transitional T2 and mature B 
cells and reduced levels of circulating immunoglobulin. TACI-Ig treatment 
inhibits both the production of collagen-specific Abs and the progression of 
disease in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In BLyS-deficient mice, B cell 
development is blocked at the transitional T1 stage such that virtually no 
mature B cells are present, while B-1 cell numbers are relatively normal. These 
findings further elucidate the roles of BLyS and APRIL in modulating B cell 
development and suggest that BLyS is required for the development of most but 
not all mature B cell populations found in the periphery.
