Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common human autoimmune disease. A 
petroleum ether extract of Eugenia aquea (E. aquea) was analyzed by GC/MS. 
Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were investigated in rats with 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). An AIA rat model received orally/daily a 
vehicle, diclofenac (100 mg per kg b.w.), and E. aquea extract (50 or 100 or 200 
mg per kg b.w.; for 21 days). Fifty-five out of 70 compounds (97.77%) were 
identified: eucalyptol (34.14%), α-pinene (15.91%), l-verbenone (8.01%), camphor 
(7.38%) and borneol (6.74%). In an acute oral toxicity study, the E. aquea 
extract did not show any toxic effects in rats at 2000 mg/ kg-1. Only a high 
dose of the E. aquea extract or diclofenac significantly alleviated (P < 
0.05-0.001) all complications observed in arthritic rats, including body weight 
loss, articular/extra-articular oxidative injury and synovial joint inflammation 
by increasing food intake as well as improving the antioxidant defense system 
and inflammatory marker. The dose-dependent modulatory activity of the E. aquea 
extract was statistically significant. It was equivalent to and sometimes even 
better than that of diclofenac. The present study proved the antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory activities of the E. aquea extract, which could be attributed 
to the presence of eucalyptol and α-pinene.
