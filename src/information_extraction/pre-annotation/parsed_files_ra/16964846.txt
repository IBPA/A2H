Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a nonionizing, noninvasive, laser-based 
technology was adapted to joint imaging for the first time. Pulsed laser light 
in the near-infrared region was directed toward a joint with resultant 
ultrasonic signals recorded and used to reconstruct images that present the 
optical properties in subsurface joint tissues. The feasibility of this joint 
imaging system was validated on a Sprague Dawley rat tail model and verified 
through comparison with histology. With sufficient penetration depth, PAT 
realized tomographic imaging of a joint as a whole organ noninvasively. Based on 
the optical contrast, various intra- and extra-articular tissues, including 
skin, fat, muscle, blood vessels, synovium and bone, were presented successfully 
in images with satisfactory spatial resolution that was primarily limited by the 
bandwidth of detected photoacoustic signals rather than optical diffusion as 
occurs in traditional optical imaging. PAT, with its intrinsic advantages, may 
provide a unique opportunity to enable the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint 
disorders, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, and to monitor therapeutic outcomes with 
high sensitivity and accuracy.
