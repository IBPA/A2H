Classical immunotoxins compromise a binding component (for example, a ligand, 
antibody or fragment thereof) and a cytotoxic component, usually derived from 
bacteria or plants (for example, Pseudomonas exotoxin A or ricin). Despite 
successful testing in vitro, the clinical development of immunotoxins has been 
hampered by immunogenicity and unsatisfactory safety profiles. Therefore, 
research has focused on fully human pro-apoptotic components suitable for the 
development of cytolytic fusion proteins (CFP). We recently reported that human 
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAP) can induce apoptosis when delivered to 
rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Here, we describe a new fully human CFP 
called H22(scFv)-MAP, which specifically targets CD64(+) cells. We show that 
H22(scFv)-MAP can efficiently kill proliferating HL-60 pro-monocytic cells in 
vitro. In addition, the human CFP specifically eliminates polarized M1 
macrophages in a transgenic mouse model of cutaneous chronic inflammation. 
Because M1 macrophages promote the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory 
diseases, targeting this cell population with H22(scFv)-MAP could help to treat 
diseases such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel 
disease.
