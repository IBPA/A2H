AIM: Hyperoside is a flavonol glycoside mainly found in plants of the genera 
Hypericum and Crataegus, which has shown anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and 
anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
hyperoside on human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in vitro and 
on mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in vivo.
METHODS: FLSs were isolated from primary synovial tissues obtained from 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and exposed to LPS (1 μg/mL). Cell viability 
and proliferation were measured with MTT and BrdU assay. Cell migration was 
assessed using wound-healing assay and Transwell assay. DNA binding of NF-κB was 
measured using a TransAM-NFkappaB kit. The localization of p65 subunit was 
detected with immunocytochemistry. CIA was induced in mice by primary 
immunization with Bovine Type II collagen (CII) emulsified in CFA, followed by a 
booster injection 3 weeks later. The arthritic mice were treated with hyperoside 
(25, 50 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), ip) for 3 weeks, and the joint tissues were harvested 
for histological analysis.
RESULTS: Hyperoside (10, 50, 100 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced 
proliferation and migration of human RA FLSs in vitro. Furthermore, hyperoside 
decreased LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 and MMP-9 in the cells. 
Moreover, hyperoside inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα, and 
suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65 and DNA biding of NF-κB in 
the cells. Three-week administration of hyperoside significantly decreased the 
clinical scores, and alleviated synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell 
infiltration and cartilage damage in mice with CIA.
CONCLUSION: Hyperoside inhibits LPS-induced proliferation, migration and 
inflammatory responses in human RA FLSs in vitro by suppressing activation of 
the NF-κB signaling pathway, which contributes to the therapeutic effects 
observed in mice with CIA.
