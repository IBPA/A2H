BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the 
synovial tissue. High systemic doses are necessary to achieve therapeutic levels 
of anti-rheumatic drugs in the joints. Gene transfer might provide a more 
efficient delivery system for genes encoding therapeutic proteins.
METHODS: The artificial chromosome expression system (ACE System) is a new 
non-integrating, non-viral gene expression system which functions like a natural 
chromosome. This technology offers advantages over current expression systems 
because it allows stable and predictable expression of proteins encoded by 
single or multiple genes over long periods of time. We are developing ex vivo 
gene therapy using murine artificial chromosomes containing a reporter gene 
(LacZ and red fluorescent protein (RFP)) for local delivery of genes in rats 
with adjuvant arthritis (AA).
RESULTS: The delivery of the intact ACE System into rat fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLS) and rat skin fibroblasts (RSF) was detected within 24 to 48 h 
post-transfection. After growing cells under selection, clones expressing LacZ 
and RFP were identified. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of local 
delivery of a reporter gene to the joints of rats with AA by ex vivo gene 
therapy. This resulted in engraftment of the injected cells in the synovial 
tissue microarchitecture and expression of the reporter gene.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the potential feasibility of treating 
arthritis and other inflammatory diseases using fibroblasts containing the ACE 
System as a non-viral vector for gene therapy.
