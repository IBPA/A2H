Soluble gp130 is the natural inhibitor of trans-signaling mediated by the 
soluble IL-6/IL-6R complex. In mouse models, recombinant sgp130 has been 
successfully applied for the treatment of diseases that are triggered and 
maintained by soluble IL-6R like Crohn's disease, peritonitis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and colon cancer. The novel heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 
(p28/EBV-induced gene 3) has been shown to act via a heterodimeric receptor 
complex of gp130 and the WSX-1 receptor, and to co-regulate the Th(1) immune 
response after infection. Therefore, we have tested the potential of the 
recombinant sgp130-Fc protein to also inhibit signaling-mediated IL-27. Here we 
show that sgp130-Fc does not interfere with IL-27 signaling. We therefore 
conclude that IL-27 does not bind with high affinity to gp130.
