Particular alleles of HLA contribute to disease susceptibility and severity in 
many autoimmune conditions, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are 
often unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the shared epitope (SE), an 
HLA-DRB1-coded sequence motif that is the single most significant genetic risk 
factor for erosive rheumatoid arthritis, acts as a signal transduction ligand 
that potently activates osteoclastogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. The SE 
enhanced the production of several pro-osteoclastogenic factors and facilitated 
osteoclast (OC) differentiation in mouse and human cells in vitro. Transgenic 
mice expressing a human HLA-DRB1 allele that code the SE motif demonstrated 
markedly higher propensity for osteoclastogenesis and enhanced bone degradation 
capacity ex vivo. In addition, the SE enhanced the differentiation of Th17 cells 
expressing the receptor activator for NF-ÎºB ligand. When the two agents were 
combined, IL-17 and the SE enhanced OC differentiation synergistically. When 
administered in vivo to mice with collagen-induced arthritis, the SE ligand 
significantly increased arthritis severity, synovial tissue OC abundance, and 
bone erosion. Thus, the SE contributes to arthritis severity by activating an 
OC-mediated bone-destructive pathway. These findings suggest that besides 
determining the target specificity of autoimmune responses, HLA molecules may 
influence disease outcomes by shaping the pathogenic consequences of such 
responses.
