Autoimmune diseases are conditions caused by an over reactive immune system that 
attacks self-tissues and organs. Although the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease 
is complex and multi-factorial, inflammation is commonly involved. Therefore, 
anti-inflammatory therapies hold potential for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases. However, long-term control of inflammation is challenging and most of 
the currently used drugs have side effects. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an 
anti-inflammatory protein with a well-known safety profile. The therapeutic 
potential of AAT has been tested in several autoimmune disease models. The first 
study using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector showed that AAT 
gene transfer prevented the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the 
non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Subsequent studies showed that treatment 
with AAT protein prevented and reversed type 1 diabetes. The beneficial effects 
of AAT treatment have also been observed in other autoimmune disease models such 
as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This paper reviews the 
therapeutic application of AAT and discusses possible mechanisms of action in 
various autoimmune diseases.
