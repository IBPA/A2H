Cell adhesion molecules play a central role at every step of the immune 
response. The function of leukocytes can be regulated by modulating adhesion 
interactions between cell adhesion molecules to develop therapeutic agents 
against autoimmune diseases. Among the different cell adhesion molecules that 
participate in the immunologic response, CD2 and its ligand CD58 (LFA-3) are two 
of the best-characterized adhesion molecules mediating the immune response. To 
modulate the cell adhesion interaction, peptides were designed from the 
discontinuous epitopes of the beta-strand region of CD2 protein. The two strands 
were linked by a peptide bond. beta-Strands in the peptides were nucleated by 
inserting a beta-sheet-inducing Pro-Gly sequence with key amino acid sequences 
from CD2 protein that binds to CD58. Using a fluorescence assay, peptides that 
exhibited potential inhibitory activity in cell adhesion were evaluated for 
their ability to bind to CD58 protein. A model for peptide binding to CD58 
protein was proposed based on docking studies. Administration of one of the 
peptides, P3 in collagen-induced arthritis in the mouse model, indicated that 
peptide P3 was able to suppress rheumatoid arthritis in mice.
