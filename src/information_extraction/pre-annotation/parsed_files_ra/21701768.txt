The purpose of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory effects of a glycoprotein isolated from the alga Porphyra 
yezoensis in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. First, we extracted a 
novel material with antioxidant activity from P. yezoensis, confirmed by 
SDS-PAGE to be a glycoprotein, which we named P. yezoensis glycoprotein (PGP). 
PGP inhibited the production of NO and ROS and expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α 
and IL-1β, which are involved in the pathogenesis of many 
inflammation-associated human diseases, including septic shock, hemorrhagic 
shock and rheumatoid arthritis. Next, we determined the mechanisms behind the 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of PGP. We focused on the Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway because it is well-known to induce the 
pro-inflammatory proteins that trigger MAPK and NF-κB activation in 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative events. PGP treatment reduced the 
formation of the TLR4-IRAK4 and TLR4-TRIF binding complexes in response to LPS. 
Moreover, it inhibited LPS-induced activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB 
by abrogating IκB phosphorylation. PGP also suppressed the phosphorylation of 
ERK1/2 and JNK in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that PGP exerts 
its anti-inflammatory effects by modulating TLR4 signaling and thus inhibiting 
the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases.
