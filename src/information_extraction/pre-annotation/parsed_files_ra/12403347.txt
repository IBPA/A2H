Activation of helperT cell has been implicated in a number of autoimmune 
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. The underlying mechanism that initiates 
and promotes disease progression remains unclear, but it is apparent that helper 
T cells and autoantigens play prominent roles. Identification of the 
autoantigens has proven to be extremely difficult, and therefore strategies for 
promoting tolerance induction remain limited. Since autoimmune diseases are 
closely associated with specific major histocompatibility complex class II 
molecules such as HLA-DR4, the use of competitor peptides is an alternative 
strategy. A limitation of competitor peptides, however, is that they are 
ineffective in vivo. In the studies presented here, we demonstrate that coupling 
competitor peptides to a cell-surface receptor ligand, transferrin, enhances 
their ability to block helper T cell responses using the DO11.10 transgenic 
mouse as our model system.
