To explore the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the perspective of 
metabolomics, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) 
technology was used to observe changes in the metabolic profiles of urine output 
from rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA). Sprague-Dawley rats were 
randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group, with eight in 
each. Rats in the experimental group were induced by intracutaneous innoculation 
of 0.1 mL Freund's complete adjuvant to right paws. On day 20 after 
immunization, the metabolic profiles between rat control and experimental groups 
were compared by combining GC-TOF/MS technology with multivariate statistical 
approaches, including principal component analysis, partial least squares 
discriminant analysis and orthogonal projections to latent 
structures-discriminant analysis. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, 
including 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid, tartronic acid, dehydroshikimic acid, 
hippuric acid, adenine, phenaceturic acid, l-dopa, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic 
acid and melibiose. The findings indicate that the rats with AA are disturbed in 
metabolism of purine, amino acid, fat and energy. This study also demonstrates 
that the dysfunction in a range of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, which 
leads to increased oxygen free radicals and inflammation, could cause underlying 
pathogenesis of RA. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
