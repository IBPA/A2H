PURPOSE: The authors investigated whether circulating autoantibodies against 
M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) could be a new marker for 
diagnosis for primary and secondary Sj√∂gren syndrome (SS) dry eye.
METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using both rat exorbital 
lacrimal gland acinar cell membranes and synthetic 25-mer peptide as antigens 
was used to determine autoantibodies against acinar cells and M(3) mAChRs. Also, 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was assessed to determine the biological 
effect of these autoantibodies in relation to the M(3) mAChR.
RESULTS: Sera from dry eye primary SS (pSS) or secondary SS (sSS) patients 
tested by ELISA recognized membrane lacrimal gland acinar cells antigens and the 
synthetic 25-mer peptide, corresponding to the second extracellular loop of 
human M(3) mAChRs. Moreover, the IgG fraction and the corresponding 
affinity-purified anti-M(3) peptide autoantibodies from the same patients were 
able to activate NOS coupled to lacrimal gland M(3) mAChRs. As controls, IgG and 
sera from women without dry eye with or without rheumatoid arthritis and from 
normal control subjects gave negative results on ELISA and biological assay; 
thus demonstrating the specificity of the reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies against mAChR may be considered among the serum 
factors implicated in the pathophysiology of the development of pSS dry eyes and 
could be a new marker to differentiate SS dry eyes from non-SS dry eyes.
