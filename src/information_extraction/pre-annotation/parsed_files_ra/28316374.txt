Interleukin-17 (IL-17) induces the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) and chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL2 and is a cytokine that 
acts as an inflammation mediator. During infection, IL-17 is needed to eliminate 
extracellular bacteria and fungi, by inducing antimicrobial peptides such as 
defensin. This cytokine also plays an important role in chronic inflammation 
that occurs during the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergies such as 
human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for which a mouse model of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) is available. In autoimmune diseases such as RA and multiple 
sclerosis (MS), IL-17 is produced by helper T (Th) cells that are stimulated by 
IL-1β and IL-6 derived from phagocytes such as macrophages and from tissue 
cells. IL-17 contributes to various lesions that are produced by Th17 cells, one 
subset of helper T cells, and by γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells. It 
strongly contributes to autoimmune diseases that are accompanied by chronic 
inflammation. Thus, a functional understanding of Th17 cells is extremely 
important. In this review, we highlight the roles of cytokines that promote the 
development and maintenance of pathogenic Th17 cells in autoimmune diseases.
