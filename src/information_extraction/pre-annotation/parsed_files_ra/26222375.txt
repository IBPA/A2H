AIM: The present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and 
antiarthritic activity of Rosa centifolia aqueous extract (RC) in a 
carrageenan-induced paw edema model and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced 
arthritis.
METHODS: Anti-inflammatory activity of RC was evaluated using the 
carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats. Arthritis was induced in rats by 
sub-plantar administration of CFA. Joint size was measured at regular intervals 
by using a micrometer screw gauge. Serum and ankle joints of rats immunized with 
CFA were collected and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 
estimation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level and dot blot for secretory 
cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6. An acute and 28-day oral toxicity study 
was carried out to evaluate the safety of the test drug.
RESULTS: Pre-treatment with RC produced a dose-dependent reduction in 
carrageenan-induced paw edema and CFA-induced arthritis models and was effective 
as indomethacin. RC also inhibited the delayed increase in joint diameter as 
seen in control and indomethacin-treated animals in CFA-induced arthritis. The 
expression of proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β was also found to 
be less in the RC-treated group as compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it was suggested that Rosa centifolia could 
be considered as a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic agent.
