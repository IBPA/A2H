Microdialysis, a sampling method for pharmacokinetics⁻pharmacodynamics (PK⁻PD) 
modeling in preclinical and clinical studies, is a convenient in vivo sampling 
technique. Geniposide (GE), an iridoid glycoside compound, is the major active 
ingredient of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit which has an anti-inflammatory 
effect. In this study, an articular cavity microdialysis sampling system for 
adjuvant arthritic (AA) rats was established to study the effect of GE on the 
release of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) in AA rats induced by Freund's complete 
adjuvant (FCA). An UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed to determine the 
concentrations of GE and PGE₂ in the dialysate. Through the determination of 
drug concentrations and PGE₂ efficacy levels in the dialysate, the developed 
methods were successfully applied to set up concentration⁻time and effect⁻time 
profiles followed by PK⁻PD modeling of GE's effect on decreasing PGE₂ release 
after oral administration of GE. The effect was well described by the developed 
PK⁻PD modeling, indicating that GE may play an anti-inflammatory role via 
decreasing AA-induced elevated PGE₂ levels. In the selection of suitable 
endogenous small molecules as effect markers, the establishment of AA rat 
joint-cavity microdialysis is an attractive technique for rational PK⁻PD 
studies.
