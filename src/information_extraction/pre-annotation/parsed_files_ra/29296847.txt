B cells play a major role in antigen presentation and antibody production in the 
development of autoimmune diseases, and some of these diseases disproportionally 
occur in females. Moreover, immune responses tend to be stronger in female vs 
male humans and mice. Because it is challenging to distinguish intrinsic from 
extrinsic influences on human immune responses, we used a personalized immune 
(PI) humanized mouse model, in which immune systems were generated de novo from 
adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in immunodeficient mice. We assessed 
the effect of recipient sex and of donor autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes 
[T1D] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) on human B-cell development in PI mice. We 
observed that human B-cell levels were increased in female recipients regardless 
of the source of human HSCs or the strain of immunodeficient recipient mice. 
Moreover, mice injected with T1D- or RA-derived HSCs displayed B-cell 
abnormalities compared with healthy control HSC-derived mice, including altered 
B-cell levels, increased proportions of mature B cells and reduced CD19 
expression. Our study revealed an HSC-extrinsic effect of recipient sex on human 
B-cell reconstitution. Moreover, the PI humanized mouse model revealed 
HSC-intrinsic defects in central B-cell tolerance that recapitulated those in 
patients with autoimmune diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of 
humanized mouse models as a tool to better understand human immune cell 
development and regulation.
