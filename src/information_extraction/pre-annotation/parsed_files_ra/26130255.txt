Healthy bone is maintained by the coordinated activities of osteoblast-mediated 
bone formation and osteoclast-dependent bone resorption. Pathologic conditions 
such as hormonal imbalance and inflammation cause increased osteoclastogenesis 
resulting in osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis. Bortezomib 
is novel antimyeloma agent that has a direct beneficial effect on bone 
formation. However, the role of bortezomib in osteoclastogenesis and underlying 
mechanisms remains to be fully comprehended. In the present study, we show that 
bortezomib directly inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand 
(RANKL)- and lipopolysaccharide-dependent osteoclast differentiation. 
Interestingly, the bortezomib-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis was 
transient, since the removal of bortezomib from culture completely restored 
osteoclast differentiation. Bortezomib impeded the induction and nuclear 
localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 and reduced 
both macrophage colony-stimulating factor- and RANKL-induced 
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. In a mouse model of 
periodontitis, bortezomib prevented alveolar bone erosion induced by 
Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide. These data not only suggest a 
previously unappreciated mechanism by which bortezomib regulates bone resorption 
but also propose novel applications of bortezomib beyond its use as an 
antimyeloma agent.
