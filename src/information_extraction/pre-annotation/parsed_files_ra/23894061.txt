OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-17A producing CD4 T-cells (TH-17 cells) are 
implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-6/STAT3 signalling drives TH-17 cell 
differentiation, and hyperactive gp130/STAT3 signalling in the gp130F/F mouse 
promotes exacerbated pathology. Conversely, STAT1-activating cytokines (eg, 
IL-27, IFN-Î³) inhibit TH-17 commitment. Here, we evaluate the impact of STAT1 
ablation on TH-17 cells during experimental arthritis and relate this to 
IL-17A-associated pathology.
METHODS: Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was established in wild type (WT), 
gp130F/F mice displaying hyperactive gp130-mediated STAT signalling and the 
compound mutants gp130F/F:Stat1-/- and gp130F/F:Il17a-/- mice. Joint pathology 
and associated peripheral TH-17 responses were compared.
RESULTS: Augmented gp130/STAT3 signalling enhanced TH-17 commitment in vitro and 
exacerbated joint pathology. Ablation of STAT1 in gp130F/F mice 
(gp130F/F:Stat1-/-) promoted the hyperexpansion of TH-17 cells in vitro and in 
vivo during AIA. Despite this heightened peripheral TH-17 cell response, disease 
severity and the number of joint-infiltrating T-cells were comparable with that 
of WT mice. Thus, gp130-mediated STAT1 activity within the inflamed synovium 
controls T-cell trafficking and retention. To determine the contribution of 
IL-17A, we generated gp130F/F:IL-17a-/- mice. Here, loss of IL-17A had no impact 
on arthritis severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Exacerbated gp130/STAT-driven disease in AIA is associated with an 
increase in joint infiltrating T-cells but synovial pathology is IL-17A 
independent.
