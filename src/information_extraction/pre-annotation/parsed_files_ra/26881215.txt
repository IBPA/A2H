INTRODUCTION: Development of an animal model of rheumatoid 
arthritis-interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) and improved knowledge of the 
pathogenesis of RA-ILD may facilitate earlier diagnosis and the development of 
more effective targeted therapies.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were studied in an adjuvant arthritis (AA) model 
induced by the injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Rats were 
sacrificed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after FCA injection. Lung tissue was 
obtained for histopathological examination and evaluation of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) 
and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1) protein expression levels.
RESULTS: Pulmonary inflammation was evident in lung tissue from day 21 after FCA 
injection. Inflammation and mild fibrosis were observed in lung tissue on day 28 
after FCA injection. Cav-1 protein expression was significantly decreased from 
day 7 through day 28 and TGF-β1 protein expression was significantly increased 
on day 28 after FCA injection compared to control (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We established an AA rat model that exhibited the extra-articular 
complication of RA-ILD. We identified Cav-1 and TGF-β1 as protein biomarkers of 
RA-ILD in this model and propose their signaling pathway as a possible target 
for therapeutic intervention.
