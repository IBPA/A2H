BACKGROUND: The functional significance of proenkephalin systems in processing 
pain remains an open question and indeed is puzzling. For example, a noxious 
mechanical stimulus does not alter the release of Met-enkephalin-like material 
(MELM) from segments of the spinal cord related to the stimulated area of the 
body, but does increase its release from other segments.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that, in the rat, a noxious 
mechanical stimulus applied to either the right or the left hind paw elicits a 
marked increase of MELM release during perifusion of either the whole spinal 
cord or the cervico-trigeminal area. However, these stimulatory effects were not 
additive and indeed, disappeared completely when the right and left paws were 
stimulated simultaneously.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We have concluded that in addition to the concept of a 
diffuse control of the transmission of nociceptive signals through the dorsal 
horn, there is a diffuse control of the modulation of this transmission. The 
"freezing" of Met-enkephalinergic functions represents a potential source of 
central sensitization in the spinal cord, notably in clinical situations 
involving multiple painful foci, e.g. cancer with metastases, poly-traumatism or 
rheumatoid arthritis.
