The roles of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) in inflammatory arthritis have 
been investigated; however, the roles of each isotype (ie, JNK1 and JNK2) in 
rheumatoid arthritis and conclusions about whether inhibition of one or both is 
necessary for amelioration of disease are unclear. By using JNK1- or 
JNK2-deficient mice in the collagen-induced arthritis and the KRN T-cell 
receptor transgenic mouse on C57BL/6 nonobese diabetic (K/BxN) serum transfer 
arthritis models, we demonstrate that JNK1 deficiency results in protection from 
arthritis, as judged by clinical score and histological evaluation in both 
models of inflammatory arthritis. In contrast, abrogation of JNK2 exacerbates 
disease. In collagen-induced arthritis, the distinct roles of the JNK isotypes 
can, at least in part, be explained by altered regulation of CD86 expression in 
JNK1- or JNK2-deficient macrophages in response to microbial products, thereby 
affecting T-cell-mediated immunity. The protection from K/BxN serum-induced 
arthritis in Jnk1(-/-) mice can also be explained by inept macrophage function 
because adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophages to Jnk1(-/-) mice restored 
disease susceptibility. Thus, our results provide a possible explanation for the 
modest therapeutic effects of broad JNK inhibitors and suggest that future 
therapies should selectively target the JNK1 isoform.
