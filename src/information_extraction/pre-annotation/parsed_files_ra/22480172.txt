Epidemiological data suggest that occupational exposure to the 
amphibole-containing vermiculite in Libby, MT, was associated with increased 
risk for developing autoimmune diseases and had an odds ratio of 3.23 for 
developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and 
the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) models of RA were employed to determine 
whether exposure to Libby amphibole (LA) induced a more rapid onset, increased 
expression, or prolonged course of RA. Female Lewis rats were intratracheally 
instilled with total doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg LA or 0.5 or 1.5 mg 
amosite asbestos, and arthritis was induced with either the PG-PS or CIA model. 
Neither LA nor amosite exposure affected the disease course in the CIA model, or 
the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(CCP) antibodies. LA exposure reduced swelling in the PG-PS model and decreased 
anti-PG-PS and total immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titers. Both amosite and LA 
exposure increased the number of rats with circulating anti-nuclear antibodies 
(ANA), the majority of which presented a speckled staining pattern. However, 
this ANA enhancement was not dose responsive. These results failed to show a 
positive correlation between LA exposure and RA disease in two animal models, 
although upregulated ANA suggest an altered immunological profile consistent 
with other systemic autoimmune diseases.
