Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease resulting in chronic synovial 
inflammation. Molecular imaging could be used to monitor therapy response, thus 
enabling tailored therapy regimens and enhancing therapeutic outcome. Here, we 
hypothesized that response to etanercept could be monitored by radionuclide 
imaging in arthritic mice. We tested 3 different targets, namely fibroblast 
activation protein (FAP), macrophages, and integrin αvβ3.
METHODS: Male DBA/1J mice with collagen-induced arthritis were treated with 
etanercept. SPECT/CT scans were acquired at 1, 24, and 48 h after injection of 
(111)In-RGD2 (integrin αvβ3), (111)In-anti-F4/80-A3-1 (antimurine macrophage 
antibody), or (111)In-28H1 (anti-FAP antibody), respectively, with nonspecific 
controls included. Mice were dissected after the last scan, and scans were 
analyzed quantitatively and were correlated with macroscopic scoring.
RESULTS: Experimental arthritis was imaged with (111)In-28H1 (anti-FAP), 
(111)In-anti-F4/80-A3-1, and (111)In-RGD2. Tracer uptake in joints correlated 
with arthritis score. Treatment decreased joint uptake of tracers from 23 ± 15, 
8 ± 4, and 2 ± 1 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) to 11 ± 11 (P < 
0.001), 4 ± 4 (P < 0.001), and 1 ± 0.2 %ID/g (P < 0.01) for (111)In-28H1, 
(111)In-anti-F4/80-A3-1, and (111)In-RGD2, respectively. Arthritis-to-blood 
ratios (in mice with arthritis score 2 per joint) were higher for (111)In-28H1 
(5.5 ± 1; excluding values > 25), (111)In-anti-F4/80-A3-1 (10.4 ± 4), and 
(111)In-RGD2 (7.2 ± 1) than for control (111)In-DP47GS (0.7 ± 0.5; P = 0.002), 
(111)In-rat IgG2b (0.5 ± 0.2; P = 0.002), or coinjection of excess RGD2 (3.5), 
indicating specific uptake of all tracers in arthritic joints.
CONCLUSION: (111)In-28H1, (111)In-anti-F4/80-A3-1, and (111)In-RGD2 can be used 
to specifically monitor the response to therapy in experimental arthritis at the 
molecular level. Further studies, however, still need to be performed.
