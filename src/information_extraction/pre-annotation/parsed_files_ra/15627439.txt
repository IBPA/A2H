We found that a novel compound, R-130823 
{2-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(1-phenethyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-3-(pyridin-4-yl)-1H-pyrrole}, 
had highly selective inhibition against mitogen-activated protein kinase 
p38alpha (IC50=22 nM). The release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
interleukin-1beta, -6 and -8 was inhibited in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated 
human blood pretreated by R-130823, with IC50 values of 0.089, 0.066, 0.95 and 
0.16 microM, respectively. R-130823 reduced the established hind paw swelling in 
rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, while methotrexate showed no suppression. In the 
same model, R-130823 ameliorated adjuvant-induced hyperalgesia with rapid onset 
and long duration comparable to a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. In 
murine collagen-induced arthritis, R-130823 blocked the progress of arthritis 
when administered just after the onset of the arthritis. Histological analysis 
of the knee joints showed that proliferation of fibroblasts and synoviocytes and 
infiltration of neutrophils were ameliorated. In conclusion, R-130823 is 
expected to be an efficacious treatment for rheumatoid arthritis by blocking the 
p38 pathway.
