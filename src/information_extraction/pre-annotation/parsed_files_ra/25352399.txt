Recent evidence indicates the existence of subpopulations of myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) with distinct phenotypes and functions. Here, we 
characterized the role of MDSC subpopulations in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
arthritis in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. The splenic 
CD11b(+) Gr-1(+) MDSC population expanded in CIA mice, and these cells could be 
subdivided into polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MO) MDSC subpopulations 
based on Ly6C and Ly6G expression. During CIA, the proportion of splenic 
MO-MDSCs was increased in association with the severity of joint inflammation, 
while PMN-MDSCs were decreased. MO-MDSCs expressed higher levels of surface CD40 
and CD86 protein, but lower levels of Il10, Tgfb1, Ccr5, and Cxcr2 mRNA. 
PMN-MDSCs exhibited a more potent capacity to suppress polyclonal T-cell 
proliferation in vitro, compared with MO-MDSCs. Moreover, the adoptive transfer 
of PMN-MDSCs, but not MO-MDSCs, decreased joint inflammation, accompanied by 
reduced levels of serum cytokine secretion and the frequencies of Th1 and Th17 
cells in draining lymph nodes. These results suggest that there could be a shift 
from potently suppressive PMN-MDSCs to poorly suppressive MO-MDSCs during the 
development of experimental arthritis, which might reflect the failure of 
expanded MDSCs to suppress autoimmune arthritis.
