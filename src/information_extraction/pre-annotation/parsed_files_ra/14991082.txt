OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To determine the effect of FK506 (tacrolimus) on paw 
inflammation, TNF-alpha expression in joint, and bone and cartilage destruction 
in type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in rats.
METHODS: CIA was induced by immunization of female Lewis rats with an emulsion 
of bovine type II collagen and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Paw inflammation 
was assessed by the increase in paw volume. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha 
expression in hind knee joint was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. 
Lesions of bone and cartilage were assessed on the basis of histological change 
in knee joint, radiographic analysis in hind paw, bone mineral density in femora 
and proteoglycan contents in the cartilage of femoral heads. FK506 at doses of 
1, 1.8 and 3.2 mg/kg or its placebo formulation was orally administered to rats 
for 28 days from the day after immunization (n = 10). Effect of FK506 was 
compared with that of vehicle (distilled water).
RESULTS: FK506 at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg significantly suppressed paw swelling (p < 
0.01) and histological change in knee joint (p < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-alpha was mainly expressed in the region with a marked infiltration of 
inflammatory cells in the hind knee joint. FK506 (3.2 mg/kg) markedly reduced 
TNF-alpha expression. FK506 at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg suppressed radiographic 
changes in hind paw (p < 0.05) and also recovered the decrease in bone mineral 
density in the femora (p < 0.05). Proteoglycan contents in the cartilage of 
femoral heads were determined to evaluate the cartilage destruction more 
quantitatively and found to significantly decrease in CIA rats. FK506 at a dose 
of 1.8 mg/kg recovered the loss of proteoglycan contents (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: These results show that FK506 is effective in suppressing 
inflammation, TNF-alpha expression in joint, and damage to bone and cartilage in 
rat CIA, and may be useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
