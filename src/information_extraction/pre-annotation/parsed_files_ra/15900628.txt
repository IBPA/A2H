Inflammation is accompanied by activation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system 
(KKS). KKS activation has been demonstrated in a variety of inflammatory human 
diseases. To further explore the participation of KKS in arthritis and 
inflammatory bowel disease, we used two experimental animal models in arthritis 
and enterocolitis. We found that activation of KKS is associated with arthritis 
induced by intraperitoneal injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers 
(PG-PS) as well as the enterocolitis and systemic inflammation induced also by 
PG-PS when injected into the intestinal wall of genetically susceptible Lewis 
rats. We postulated that KKS participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory 
reactions involved in cellular injury, coagulation, fibrinolysis, kinin 
formation, complement activation, cytokine secretion, and release of proteases. 
We demonstrated that therapy with a specific plasma kallikrein inhibitor 
modulated the experimental enterocolitis, arthritis, and systemic inflammation. 
The fact that deficiency of plasma high molecular weight kininogen in the 
genetically susceptible Lewis rat results in decreased chronic enterocolitis and 
systemic inflammation also supports our hypothesis. We suggest that KKS plays a 
similar role in idiopathic human intestinal inflammatory disease and arthritis, 
making kallikrein-kinin system proteins appealing targets for drug therapy in 
chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.
