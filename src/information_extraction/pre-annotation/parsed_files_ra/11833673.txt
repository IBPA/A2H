Bone turnover is assessed indirectly by measurement of biochemical markers of 
bone turnover. Osteocalcin, a 49-amino-acid protein is a major noncollagenous 
protein of bone matrix, synthesized by osteoblasts and odontoblasts. Various 
assays exist for assessment of osteocalcin and concentrations in the same serum 
or plasma sample may vary enormously. The used antibodies may recognize intact 
osteocalcin and/or circulating fragments of osteocalcin. We here describe and 
validate a new automated immunoassay system for measurement of intact 
osteocalcin (DPC IMMULITE assay) using monoclonal antibodies (mouse) against the 
C-terminus of osteocalcin (AA 44-49). For detection polyclonal antibodies (goat) 
directed against the N-terminus (AA 1-17) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase 
are used. While different laboratory assays show marked clinical discordance, we 
evaluated our results comparatively to an established IRMA method (Nichols). We 
observed a highly significant correlation between both assays (r = 0.9352, p < 
0.0001, n = 286) for healthy persons and also for patient samples (osteoporosis, 
diabetes type 1, rheumatoid arthritis). Very low inter- and intraassay 
covariance as well as highly significant linearity (analytical recovery near 
100%) tested by serial dilutions were demonstrated for the DPC IMMULITE intact 
osteocalcin assay. We conclude that the IMMULITE assay is a useful method for 
assessment of intact osteocalcin giving valuable results in comparison to an 
established non-automated assay.
