Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
chronic synovitis. This study aims to investigate the role of sonic hedgehog 
(SHH)-Gli signaling pathway in synovial fibroblast proliferation in rheumatoid 
arthritis. The expression of serum SHH in RA patients group was significantly 
increased compared with the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS), and healthy subject (healthy control, HC) groups, 
respectively; serum SHH expression of RA patients was positively correlated with 
rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies 
(anti-CCP Ab), while there was no significant correlation between SHH expression 
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). SHH, Ptch, Smo, and Gli molecules were 
highly expressed in rat RA-synovial fibroblast (RA-SF); after blocking the 
SHH-Gli signaling pathway with a Gli specific inhibitor, Gli-antagonist 61 
(GANT61), RA-SF proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and the 
apoptosis rate of RA-SF was increased as well; the expression levels of 
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGFR3 declined in SF cells after 
GANT61 treatment. Our results suggest that SHH-Gli pathway is involved in the 
pathogenesis of RA, and blocking SHH-Gli pathway inhibits RA-SF cell 
proliferation and increases cell apoptosis, which may shed light on developing 
new ideas for RA treatment.
