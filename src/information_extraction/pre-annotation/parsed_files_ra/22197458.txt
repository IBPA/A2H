Hyaluronan (HA) fragments are able to induce inflammation by stimulating both 
CD44 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). CD44 and TLR-4 activation stimulates the 
liberation of NF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the effects of hyaluronidase (HYAL) treatment, which 
depolymerises HA into small fragments, and of the addition of specific 
hyaluronan synthases-1, 2, and 3 small interference RNA (HASs siRNA), which 
silence HASs activity, on normal mouse synovial fibroblasts (NSF) and on 
rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASF) obtained from mice subjected to 
collagen induced arthritis (CIA). The addition of HYAL to NSF and/or RASF 
significantly increased the TLR-4, CD44 and NF-kB activity, as well as the 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-33 (IL-33) in 
both groups, but to a greater extent in RASF. The addition to NSF and/or RASF of 
the HASs siRNA, which block HASs activity and therefore the availability of HA 
substrate for HYAL, was able to reduce HYAL effects in both NSF and RASF. 
Finally, the HA evaluation confirmed the increment of HA at low molecular weight 
after HYAL treatment.
