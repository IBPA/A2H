T-helper 17 (Th17) cells are a newly discovered CD4(+) helper T-cell subset that 
produces interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F. IL-17A plays important roles in 
allergic responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity, contact 
hypersensitivity, and allergic airway inflammation. IL-17A promotes inflammation 
by inducing various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, recruiting 
neutrophils, enhancing antibody production, and activating T cells. IL-17A 
expression is also augmented in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis 
and rheumatoid arthritis. Using mouse models of these diseases, we found that 
IL-17A plays a central role in their development. IL-6 is required for the 
development of Th17 cells and tumor necrosis factor functions downstream of 
IL-17A during the effector phase. IL-1 is important both for developing Th17 
cells and eliciting inflammation. Th17 cells, like Th1 and Th2 cells, are 
involved in host defense against infections, but the contribution of these Th 
subsets to defense mechanisms differs among pathogens. The roles of IL-17F 
remain largely unknown. In this review, we introduce how IL-17A/IL-17F are 
involved in inflammatory immune responses and host defense mechanisms and 
discuss their relationship with other cytokines in the development of 
inflammatory and infectious diseases.
