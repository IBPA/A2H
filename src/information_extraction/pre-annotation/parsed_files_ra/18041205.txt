Certification of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as an occupational disease should 
be based on evidence that the job performance is a dominant factor responsible 
for its development. Features of the way the job is performed, which can 
increase the constriction in carpal tunnel and their quantitative analysis are 
presented. They include a specific position of the hand during the job 
performance (dorsal bending, alternate bending and extension), e.g., overcoming 
resistance with fingers, pincher grip, object catching and holding, exerting 
pressure on the hand, repeated movements or work with vibratory tools. These 
features characterize work of persons employed in meat processing, fitting of 
sub-assemblies, packing of products, or employed as supermarket cashiers. CTS 
occurrence in persons working with computers and thus using a keyboard or a 
mouse is now greatly limited owing to the improvement in ergonomic parameters of 
computer-equipped workposts. The paper indicates CTS risk factors (carpal tunnel 
size, post-traumatic lesions, rheumatoid arthritis, female gender, hormonal 
changes during menopause and pregnancy, and other hormonal disorders like 
hypothyreosis, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, high 
alcohol consumption), which have been very well evidenced. In the summary, the 
attention was also paid to improper estimation of burden to upper limbs by 
listing jobs performed and stressing the need to quantitatively define hand 
burdening factors and estimate duration of such burdens.
