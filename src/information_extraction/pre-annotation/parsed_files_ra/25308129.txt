Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the 
synovial joints. The currently available drugs for RA are effective only in a 
proportion of patients and their prolonged use is associated with severe adverse 
effects. Thus, new anti-arthritic agents are being sought. We tested 
Pristimerin, a naturally occurring triterpenoid, for its therapeutic activity 
against rat adjuvant arthritis. Pristimerin effectively inhibited both arthritic 
inflammation and cartilage and bone damage in the joints. Pristimerin-treated 
rats exhibited a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, 
IL-18, and IL-23) and the IL-6/IL-17-associated transcription factors (pSTAT3 
and ROR-γt), coupled with an increase in the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10. 
Also increased was IFN-γ, which can inhibit IL-17 response. In addition, the 
Th17/Treg ratio was altered in favor of immune suppression and the RANKL/OPG 
ratio was skewed towards anti-osteoclastogenesis. This is the first report on 
testing Pristimerin in arthritis. We suggest further evaluation of Pristimerin 
in RA patients.
