B cells and their secreted products participate in the intricate network of 
pathogenic and regulatory immune responses. In human autoimmune diseases like 
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes, a role 
for B cells and antibodies is well established. However, in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), despite the presence of autoantibodies, B cells were less considered as a 
major participant of autoimmune processes, until recently. Several lines of 
evidence now indicate a more active role for B cells in disease pathogenesis. In 
this review, we discuss the diverse roles of B cells in autoimmune diseases with 
particular focus on multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as well as the recently generated spontaneous 
EAE mouse models.
