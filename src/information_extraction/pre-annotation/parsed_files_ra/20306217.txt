OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of a combined therapy consisting of 
dexamethasone and osteoprotegerin (OPG) on bone alterations and disease activity 
in antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in the rat.
METHODS: AIA rats received dexamethasone (0.25 mg kg(-1) day(-1), i.p.), OPG 
(2.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1), i.p.), or a combination of both at regular intervals for 
21 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment, bone structure was analyzed by 
histomorphometry. Primary spongiosa was measured using linear scanning.
RESULTS: AIA led to significant periarticular and axial bone loss. Dexamethasone 
monotherapy substantially suppressed joint swelling without inhibiting bone loss 
of the secondary spongiosa, whereas OPG monotherapy showed no anti-inflammatory 
effect. Despite reduction of bone resorption, OPG did not inhibit AIA-induced 
bone loss. In contrast, the combination of dexamethasone and OPG not only 
produced an anti-inflammatory effect, but also resulted in inhibition of 
periarticular and axial bone loss. OPG increased trabecular number of the 
primary spongiosa whilst combination therapy led to an increase in both 
trabecular number and trabecular width.
CONCLUSION: The principle of combining a glucocorticoid together with inhibition 
of the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) may be an effective 
bone-saving therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.
