Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human interleukin-10 (rhuIL-10) has been 
evaluated in an extensive series of in vivo and in vitro nonclinical safety 
studies, including genetic toxicology, single- and repeat-dose systemic toxicity 
and toxicokinetics, reproductive toxicity, and specialized irritation studies. 
The primary test species in the toxicology studies were the mouse and monkey 
based on rhuIL-10 activity in receptor binding and ex vivo cytokine assays. 
Supported by a detailed preclinical program of therapeutic and prophylactic 
animal models in autoimmune diseases, the initial clinical development program 
has focused on investigating the therapeutic potential of rhuIL-10 (Tenovil) in 
Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The results of the subcutaneous 
toxicity studies, up to 3 months dosing duration in mice and 6 months dosing 
duration in monkeys, support the development of rhuIL-10 for present and future 
clinical indications by the subcutaneous route of administration.
