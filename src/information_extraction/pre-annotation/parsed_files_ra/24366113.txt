Interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-17 are thought to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because both pro-inflammatory 
cytokines are found in synovial fluid of RA patients. In this study, we examined 
the pharmacological profiles of Y-320, a new phenylpyrazoleanilide 
immunomodulator. Y-320 inhibited IL-17 production by CD4 T cells stimulated with 
IL-15 with IC50 values of 20 to 60 nM. Oral administration of Y-320 (0.3 to 3 
mg/kg) significantly inhibited the development and progression of arthritis and 
joint destruction with reduction of IL-17 mRNA expression in arthritic joints of 
type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. Y-320 in combination 
with anti-murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± monoclonal antibody showed a 
synergistic effect on mouse CIA. Moreover, therapeutic treatment with Y-320 (0.3 
and 1 mg/kg orally) ameliorated CIA in cynomolgus monkeys. Our results suggest 
that Y-320, an orally active inhibitor for IL-17 production, provides a useful 
therapy for RA.
