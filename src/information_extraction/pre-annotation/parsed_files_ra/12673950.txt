Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent inflammatory cytokine involved in many 
pathophysiological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's 
disease. Despite recent evidence regarding signal transduction via TNF receptor 
and its biological actions, the mechanism of TNF release remains poorly 
understood. To clarify how production and release of TNF are regulated, we 
focused on mast cells and microglia which are involved in allergic inflammation 
and brain damage or recovery, respectively. In RBL-2H3 mast cells, anti-allergic 
drugs including azelastine inhibited the release of TNF more potently than 
degranulation in response to antigen or ionomycin. It was also demonstrated that 
TNF releasing steps are regulated via the PKC alpha-dependent pathway. 
Furthermore, Rho GTPases, possibly Rac, were shown to be involved in 
antigen-induced TNF transcription through activating PKC beta I. In cultured rat 
brain microglia, we found that extracellular ATP triggers the release of TNF via 
the P2X7 receptor. ERK and JNK are also involved in ATP-induced TNF 
transcription, while p38 regulates the transport of TNF mRNA from the nucleus to 
the cytosol. Additionally, JNK and p38, but not ERK, are activated via the P2X7 
receptor. A better understanding of the specific pathways that regulate TNF 
release for each effector cell may offer further possible therapeutic targets 
for inflammatory diseases.
