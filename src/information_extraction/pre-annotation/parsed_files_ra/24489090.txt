Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders are associated with altered 
activity of the immunomodulatory enzyme IDO. However, the precise contributions 
of IDO function to autoimmunity remain unclear. In this article, we examine the 
effect of two different IDO enzymes, IDO1 and IDO2, on the development of 
autoimmune arthritis in the KRN preclinical model of rheumatoid arthritis. We 
find that IDO2, not IDO1, is critical for arthritis development, providing 
direct evidence of separate in vivo functions for IDO1 and IDO2. Mice null for 
Ido2 display decreased joint inflammation relative to wild-type mice owing to a 
reduction in pathogenic autoantibodies and Ab-secreting cells. Notably, IDO2 
appears to specifically mediate autoreactive responses, but not normal B cell 
responses, as total serum Ig levels are not altered and IDO2 knockout mice are 
able to mount productive Ab responses to model Ags in vitro and in vivo. 
Reciprocal adoptive transfer studies confirm that autoantibody production and 
arthritis are modulated by IDO2 expression in a cell type extrinsic to the T 
cell. Taken together, our results, provide important insights into IDO2 function 
by defining its pathogenic contributions to autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.
