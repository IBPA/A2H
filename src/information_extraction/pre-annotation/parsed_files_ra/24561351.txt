A urinary metabonomics method based on the ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) had been established to investigate the holistic efficacy of 
Wu-tou decoction (WTD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used to 
treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. 
Multivariate statistical approaches, such as principal component analysis (PCA) 
and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis 
(OPLS-DA) were used to distinguish healthy control group, AIA model group and 
WTD treated group and find potential biomarkers. There was a clear separation 
among the three groups in PCA model. Sixteen potential biomarkers had been 
identified using OPLS-DA, and 11 of them was considered to be in response to 
therapeutic effects of WTD involved in tryptophan metabolism, phenylalanine 
metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, bile acid biosynthesis, steroid 
hormone biosynthesis and valine metabolism. In this study, WTD also showed good 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in vivo, and it could suppress 
histopathological changes of AIA rats. There might be a correlation between 
these results and the regulation of the disturbed metabolites in urine. This 
study demonstrates that metabonomics is a powerful methodology to gain insight 
in the mechanism of TCM formula in therapy.
