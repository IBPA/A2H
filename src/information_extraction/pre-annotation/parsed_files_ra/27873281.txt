The recent development of severely immunodeficient mouse strains enabled the 
production of new-generation humanized mice, in which major components of the 
human immune system are reconstituted. These new-generation humanized mice can 
be infected with human pathogenic viruses that do not infect regular mice and 
target cells of the hematoimmune system. Here we describe the method for 
preparing humanized mice, infecting them with EBV, and for their virological and 
immunological analyses. The results obtained from our own mouse models are 
briefly described.
