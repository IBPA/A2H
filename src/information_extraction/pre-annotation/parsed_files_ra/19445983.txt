Protease-sensitive macromolecular prodrugs have attracted interest for 
bio-responsive drug delivery to sites with up-regulated proteolytic activities 
such as inflammatory or cancerous lesions. Here we report the development of a 
novel polymeric photosensitizer prodrug (T-PS) to target thrombin, a protease 
up-regulated in synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, for 
minimally invasive photodynamic synovectomy. In T-PS, multiple photosensitizer 
units are tethered to a polymeric backbone via short, thrombin-cleavable peptide 
linkers. Photoactivity of the prodrug is efficiently impaired due to energy 
transfer between neighbouring photosensitizer units. T-PS activation by 
exogenous and endogenous thrombin induced an increase in fluorescence emission 
by a factor of 16 after in vitro digestion and a selective fluorescence 
enhancement in arthritic lesions in vivo, in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse 
model. In vitro studies on primary human synoviocytes showed a phototoxic effect 
only after enzymatic digestion of the prodrug and light irradiation, thus 
demonstrating the functionality of T-PS induced PDT. The developed 
photosensitizer prodrugs combine the passive targeting capacity of 
macromolecular drug delivery systems with site-selective photosensitizer release 
and activation. They illuminate lesions with pathologically enhanced proteolytic 
activity and induce cell death, subsequent to irradiation.
