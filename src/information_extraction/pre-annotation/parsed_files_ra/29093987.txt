PURPOSE: Beyond the limited scope of non-specific polyclonal regulatory T cell 
(Treg)-based immunotherapy, which depends largely on serendipity, the present 
study explored a target Treg subset appropriate for the delivery of a novel 
epitope spreader Pep19 antigen as part of a sophisticated form of immunotherapy 
with defined antigen specificity that induces immune tolerance.
METHODS: Human polyclonal CD4+CD25+CD127lo- Tregs (127-Tregs) and naïve 
CD4+CD25+CD45RA+ Tregs (45RA-Tregs) were isolated and were stimulated with 
target peptide 19 (Pep19)-pulsed dendritic cells in a tolerogenic milieu 
followed by ex vivo expansion. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) and rapamycin were 
added to selectively exclude the outgrowth of contaminating effector T cells 
(Teffs). The following parameters were investigated in the expanded 
antigen-specific Tregs: the distinct expression of the immunosuppressive Treg 
marker Foxp3, epigenetic stability (demethylation in the Treg-specific 
demethylated region), the suppression of Teffs, expression of the homing 
receptors CD62L/CCR7, and CD95L-mediated apoptosis. The expanded Tregs were 
adoptively transferred into an NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- mouse model of 
collagen-induced arthritis.
RESULTS: Epitope-spreader Pep19 targeting by 45RA-Tregs led to an outstanding in 
vitro suppressive T cell fate characterized by robust ex vivo expansion, the 
salient expression of Foxp3, high epigenetic stability, enhanced T cell 
suppression, modest expression of CD62L/CCR7, and higher resistance to 
CD95L-mediated apoptosis. After adoptive transfer, the distinct fate of these T 
cells demonstrated a potent in vivo immunotherapeutic capability, as indicated 
by the complete elimination of footpad swelling, prolonged survival, minimal 
histopathological changes, and preferential localization of CD4+CD25+ Tregs at 
the articular joints in a mechanistic and orchestrated way.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose human naïve CD4+CD25+CD45RA+ Tregs and the epitope 
spreader Pep19 as cellular and molecular targets for a novel antigen-specific 
Treg-based vaccination against collagen-induced arthritis.
