The immunoproteasome, a distinct class of proteasome found predominantly in 
monocytes and lymphocytes, is known to shape the antigenic repertoire presented 
on class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I). However, a specific role 
for the immunoproteasome in regulating other facets of immune responses has not 
been established. We describe here the characterization of PR-957, a selective 
inhibitor of low-molecular mass polypeptide-7 (LMP7, encoded by Psmb8), the 
chymotrypsin-like subunit of the immunoproteasome. PR-957 blocked presentation 
of LMP7-specific, MHC-I-restricted antigens in vitro and in vivo. Selective 
inhibition of LMP7 by PR-957 blocked production of interleukin-23 (IL-23) by 
activated monocytes and interferon-gamma and IL-2 by T cells. In mouse models of 
rheumatoid arthritis, PR-957 treatment reversed signs of disease and resulted in 
reductions in cellular infiltration, cytokine production and autoantibody 
levels. These studies reveal a unique role for LMP7 in controlling pathogenic 
immune responses and provide a therapeutic rationale for targeting LMP7 in 
autoimmune disorders.
