We examined the feasibility of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
vector-mediated local expression of angiostatin in the treatment of murine 
collagen-induced arthritis in a mouse model generated by immunization with 
bovine type II collagen and Freund's complete adjuvant. The HIV vector 
containing the murine angiostatin expression unit (HIV-angiostatin) was injected 
into right knee joints after arthritis development; the HIV vector containing 
the enhanced green fluorescein protein (EGFP) marker gene (HIV-EGFP) was 
injected into the left joints. Quantitative histological evaluation demonstrated 
that synovial cell hyperplasia and pannus formation were significantly reduced 
in the right knee joints as determined by this protocol. Suppression of 
radiographical changes in the ipsilateral paws was also observed. These results 
indicate that the HIV vector-mediated expression of angiostatin efficiently 
inhibits the progression of collagen-induced arthritis. Angiostatic gene therapy 
may provide a new approach to the effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
