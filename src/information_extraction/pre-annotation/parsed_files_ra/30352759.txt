BACKGROUND: Inhibiting TNF-α is an effective therapy for inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, systemic, nondiscriminatory 
neutralization of TNF-α is associated with considerable adverse effects.
METHODS: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an 
N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence 
to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal 
mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn).
RESULTS: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the 
binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric 
receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly 
expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF 
receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human 
Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the 
human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced 
binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with 
TNF-α.
CONCLUSION: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for 
inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-α to reduce the adverse 
effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-α.
