Turmeric (rich in curcuminoids) and ginger (rich in gingerols and shogaols) 
rhizomes have been widely used as dietary spices and to treat different diseases 
in Ayurveda/Chinese medicine since antiquity. Here, we compared the 
anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant activity of these two plants in rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). Both plants (at dose 200 mg/kg body weight) 
significantly suppressed (but with different degrees) the incidence and severity 
of arthritis by increasing/decreasing the production of 
anti-inflammatory/pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, and activating the 
anti-oxidant defence system. The anti-arthritic activity of turmeric exceeded 
that of ginger and indomethacin (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), 
especially when the treatment started from the day of arthritis induction. The 
percentage of disease recovery was 4.6-8.3% and 10.2% more in turmeric compared 
with ginger and indomethacin (P < 0.05), respectively. The present study proves 
the anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant activity of turmeric over ginger and 
indomethacin, which may have beneficial effects against rheumatoid arthritis 
onset/progression as shown in AIA rat model.
