Piperlongumine (PLM) is a natural product from the plant Piper longum that 
inhibits platelet aggregation, atherosclerosis plaque formation, and tumor cell 
growth. It has potential value in immunomodulation and the management of 
autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of PLM in 
regulating the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), a 
critical regulator of immune tolerance, and evaluated its clinical effects in a 
rheumatoid arthritis mouse model. We found that PLM treatment reduced 
LPS-induced murine bone marrow-derived DC maturation, characterized by reduced 
expression of CD80/86, secretion of MCP-1, IL-12p70, IL-6, TNFα, IFN-γ, and 
IL-23, and reduced alloproliferation of T cells; however, PLM does not affect 
cell differentiation. Furthermore, PLM reduced intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production by DCs and inhibited the activation of p38, JNK, NF-κB, 
and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Conversely, PLM increased the expression of 
GSTP1 and carbonyl reductase 1, two enzymes that counteract ROS effects. ROS 
inhibition by exogenous N-acetyl-l-cysteine suppressed DC maturation. PLM 
treatment improved the severity of arthritis and reduced in vivo splenic DC 
maturation, collagen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses, and ROS production in 
mice with collagen-induced arthritis. Taken together, these results suggest that 
PLM inhibits DC maturation by reducing intracellular ROS production and has 
potential as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis.
