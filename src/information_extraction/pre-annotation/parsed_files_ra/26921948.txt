Chemokines regulate the migration of cells in vivo and dysregulated expression 
of chemokines and their receptors are implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases. Inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are 
characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory cells into joints. The K/BxN 
serum transfer mouse model of inflammatory arthritis shares many similar 
features with RA. In this autoantibody-induced model of arthritis, neutrophils 
are the critical immune cells necessary for the development of joint 
inflammation and damage. In this review, we describe the use of several methods 
to study the role of chemoattractant receptors, including chemokine receptors, 
on the recruitment of neutrophils into the joint in the K/BxN model of 
inflammatory arthritis. This includes both traditional methods, such as flow 
cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme assays, as well as multiphoton in 
vivo microscopy that we have adapted to study the role of immune cell 
trafficking in and around the joint in live mice.
