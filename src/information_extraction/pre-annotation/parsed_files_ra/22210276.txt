It is well established that arthritis depresses locomotion in humans as well as 
in animal disease models. The K/BxN mouse model resembles rheumatoid arthritis 
and is widely used for research. Here, we investigate the behavioral alterations 
of arthritic K/BxN mice during arthritis development with respect to horizontal 
locomotion. Locomotor activity measurements and the methodology of ankle 
thickness measurements are compared to demonstrate the feasibility of motion 
tracking in the K/BxN mouse model. Arthritic K/BxN mice show significantly 
decreased locomotion compared to their non-arthritis K/BxN littermates. We found 
an indirect correlation of ankle thickness and locomotor activity. However, both 
parameters are only partially interdependent resulting in temporal displacement 
of maximal ankle swelling and maximal depression of locomotion by 1 week. 
Assessing the impaired movement as a behavioral test appears to be a valuable 
multifactorial parameter for the evaluation of arthritis in the K/BxN mouse 
model and provides additional information on disease progression and severity.
