Celecoxib (CXB), a COX-2 inhibitor, is primarily indicated for long-term 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The effective therapeutic efficacy of 
CXB on RA via oral administration shows adverse systemic complications, and 
therefore, local application of CXB has been recommended. The aim of the present 
study was to develop and characterize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with 
enhanced skin permeation potential of CXB. The particle size, polydispersity 
index (PDI), and percentage drug entrapment (PDE) of the developed SLNs 
(CXB-SLNs) were found to be 240 nm, < 0.3, and ~ 86% respectively. The developed 
SLNs exhibited sustained release up to 70% at the end of 48 h. Drug permeation 
was found to be 45% for SLN gel and 31% for conventional gel. The dermatokinetic 
studies also confirmed enhanced permeation of CXB in the epidermis and dermis 
and revealed superiority of the developed SLN gel vis-à-vis the conventional 
gel. Further, in the CFA-induced arthritis rat model, % arthritis index (AI) of 
the CXB-SLN gel formulation was found to be very less (18.54%) as compared to 
untreated (187.34%) and conventional gel-treated (91.61%) animals. In 
conclusion, the current study can provide a suitable alternative for the 
development of an effective topical formulation of CXB in lipid nanocarriers.
