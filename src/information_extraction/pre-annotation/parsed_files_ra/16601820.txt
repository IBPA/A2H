Adjuvant arthritis (AA) is a model of chronic inflammation induced by 
Mycobacterium butyricum and characterized by similar pathophysiological and 
pathobiochemical changes as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in humans. In this study 
the antirheumatic activity of coenzyme Q(10) supplementation was tested not only 
as to its capability to suppress the inflammation edema of the hind paw and to 
improve the body weight of the arthritic animals, but also to improve so 
important biochemical parameters as markers of inflammation and oxidative 
stress, and of mitochondrial bioenergetics. Despite the unfavorable effects on 
the rheumatic processes observed by monitoring biometric parameters (hind paw 
volume, relative body weight, relative weight of spleen), a significant 
protective effect was observed on the level of mitochondrial energetic and 
antioxidant disbalance. This finding speaks in favor of CoQ(10) supplementation 
in rheumatic patients, presumably as combinatory therapy with classical 
antirheumatics, e.g. NSAIDs.
