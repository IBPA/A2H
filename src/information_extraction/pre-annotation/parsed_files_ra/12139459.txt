Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a potent, proinflammatory mediator involved in the 
pathogenesis of a number of diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, 
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. The enzyme LTA(4) hydrolase 
represents an attractive target for pharmacological intervention in these 
disease states, since the action of this enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the 
production of LTB(4). Our previous efforts focused on the exploration of a 
series of analogues related to screening hit SC-22716 (1, 
1-[2-(4-phenylphenoxy)ethyl]pyrrolidine) and resulted in the identification of 
potent, orally active inhibitors such as 2. Additional structure-activity 
relationship studies around this structural class resulted in the identification 
of a series of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acid analogues that are potent 
inhibitors of the LTA(4) hydrolase enzyme and demonstrated good oral activity in 
a mouse ex vivo whole blood LTB(4) production assay. The efforts leading to the 
identification of clinical candidate SC-57461A (8d, 
3-[methyl[3-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]propyl]amino]propanoic acid) are described.
