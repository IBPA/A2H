We previously found that bee venom (BV) and melittin (a major component of BV) 
has anti-inflammatory effect by reacting with the sulfhydryl group of p50 of 
NF-kappaB. Since the sulfhydryl group is present in IkappaB kinase (IKKalpha and 
IKKbeta), anti-inflammatory effect of melittin via interaction with IKKs was 
investigated. We first examined binding of melittin to IKKs using surface 
plasmon resonance analyzer. Melittin binds to IKKalpha (K(d) = 1.34 x 10(-9) M) 
and IKKbeta (K(d) = 1.01 x 10(-9) M). Consistent with the high binding affinity, 
melittin (5 and 10 microg/ml) and BV (0.5, 1 and 5 microg/ml) suppressed sodium 
nitroprusside, TNF-alpha and LPS induced-IKKbeta and IKKbeta activities, IkappaB 
release, and NF-kappaB activity as well as the expressions of iNOS and COX-2, 
and the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in Raw 
264.7 mouse macrophages and synoviocytes obtained from rheumatoid arthritis 
patients. The binding affinities of melittin to mutant IKKs, was reduced, and 
the inhibitory effect of melittin on IKK and NF-kappaB activities, and NO and 
PGE(2) generation were abrogated by the reducing agents or in Raw 264.7 
transfected with mutant plasmid IKKalpha (C178A) or IKKbeta (C179A). These 
results suggest that melittin binding to the sulfhydryl group of IKKs resulted 
in reduced IKK activities, IkappaB release, NF-kappaB activity and generation of 
inflammatory mediators, indicating that IKKs may be also anti-inflammatory 
targets of BV.
