Dendritic cells with tolerogenic function (tolDC) have become a promising 
immunotherapeutic tool for reinstating immune tolerance in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and other autoimmune diseases. The concept underpinning tolDC therapy is 
that it specifically targets the pathogenic autoimmune response while leaving 
protective immunity intact. Findings from human in-vitro and mouse in-vivo 
studies have been translated into the development of clinical grade tolDC for 
the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Recently, two tolDC trials in RA and type 
I diabetes have been carried out and other trials are in progress or are 
imminent. In this review, we provide an update on tolDC therapy, in particular 
in relation to the treatment of RA, and discuss the challenges and the future 
perspectives of this new experimental immunotherapy.
