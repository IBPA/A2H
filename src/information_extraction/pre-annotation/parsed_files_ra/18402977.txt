Preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) assays are important to help evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of a potential biotherapeutic before clinical studies. The 
assay typically requires a biotherapeutic-specific reagent to minimize matrix 
effects especially when the host species are non-human primates such as 
cynomolgus monkeys and the biotherapeutic is a humanized monoclonal antibody 
(MAb). Recombinant humanized mAb 2H7 (rhuMAb2H7) binds to the extracellular 
domain of CD20 that is expressed on B cells and results in B cell depletion. It 
is currently being evaluated for its therapeutic potential in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in clinical studies. During the early development of rhuMAb2H7, a 
cynomolgus monkey PK assay was needed to help assess the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of rhuMAb2H7 in a pilot cynomolgus monkey study. However, development 
of a cynomolgus monkey PK assay was challenging due to lack of 
rhuMAb2H7-specific reagents. Here we describe an alternative method for 
detection of rhuMAb2H7 in cynomolgus monkey serum using polyclonal antibodies 
against human IgGs. This assay quantifies rhuMAb2H7 in 10% cynomolgus monkey 
serum with high sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. This assay successfully 
supported the rhuMAb2H7 development, and has the potential to be used to 
quantify other humanized MAb biotherapeutics in serum from a variety of 
non-human species.
