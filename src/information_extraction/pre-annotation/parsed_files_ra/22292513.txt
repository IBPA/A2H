PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to quantify the kinesiological effect 
of the assistance provided by service dogs on transferring from sit to stand in 
persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Twenty-four participants performed a total of eight experimental 
transfers of sit to stand, including unassisted transfers, transfers with a cane 
and transfers with assistance from a service dog. We analysed movements at the 
lower extremity joints using a three-dimensional kinematics system and two force 
plates.
RESULTS: At the hip joints, the range of motion changes and energy expenditure 
with a cane and with the service dog were smaller than that of the unassisted 
transfers. Transfers with a service dog resulted in less joint movement and less 
energy used in movements at the knee and ankle joints; participants also scored 
themselves as requiring less effort on a self-rating scale than in the other 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: A service dog provides benefits in assisting with transfers from sit 
to stand by persons with RA. Future studies should consider training the service 
dogs to assume correct positions and use appropriate timing to support their 
partners during these transfers.
