Advances in targeted immune therapeutics have profoundly improved clinical 
outcomes for patients with inflammatory arthropathies particularly rheumatoid 
arthritis. The landscape of disease that is observed and the treatment outcomes 
desired for the future have also progressed. As such there is an increasing move 
away from traditional models of end-stage, chronic disease with recognition of 
the need to consider the earliest phases of pathogenesis as a target for 
treatment leading to resolution and/or cure. In order to continue the discovery 
process and enhance our understanding of disease and treatment, we therefore 
need to continuously revisit the animal models we employ and assess their 
relevance and utility in the light of contemporary therapeutic goals. In this 
review, we highlight the areas where we consider new developments in animal 
models and their application are most required. Thus, we have contextualised the 
relevant mouse models and their use within the current concepts of human 
inflammatory arthritis pathogenesis and highlight areas of need.
