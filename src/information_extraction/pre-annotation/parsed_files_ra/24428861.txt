Vitamin D has been demonstrated to influence multiple aspects of amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology. Both human and rodent central nervous systems 
express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and/or its enzymatic machinery needed to 
fully activate the hormone. Clinical research suggests that vitamin D treatment 
can improve compromised human muscular ability and increase muscle size, 
supported by loss of motor function and muscle mass in animals following VDR 
knockout, as well as increased muscle protein synthesis and ATP production 
following vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce the 
expression of biomarkers associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in 
patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart 
failure, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease; diseases that share common 
pathophysiologies with ALS. Furthermore, vitamin D treatment greatly attenuates 
hypoxic brain damage in vivo and reduces neuronal lethality of glutamate insult 
in vitro; a hallmark trait of ALS glutamate excitotoxicity. We have recently 
shown that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improved, whereas vitamin D3 
restriction worsened, functional capacity in the G93A mouse model of ALS. In 
sum, evidence demonstrates that vitamin D, unlike the antiglutamatergic agent 
Riluzole, affects multiple aspects of ALS pathophysiology and could provide a 
greater cumulative effect.
