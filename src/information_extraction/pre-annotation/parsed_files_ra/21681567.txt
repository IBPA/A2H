To evaluate preventive and therapeutic effects of soy protein on 
collagen-induced arthritis rats. Sprague-Dawley rats immunized with bovine type 
II collagen emulsified in adjuvant and treated with soy protein (7 g/kg), 
dexamethasone (1 mg/kg), and casein (in control groups) by daily gavages 
feedings for 30 days. Score of arthritis recorded every day for each paws of 
animal. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin6, leptin, and adiponectin were 
measured in serums. Treatment with soy protein resulted in significant delay in 
time to onset of arthritis as well as significantly decreased arthritis 
incidence, clinical arthritis severity score, histopathological arthritis 
severity score, and in vivo cell-mediated immunity to collagen (P < 0.05). 
Administration of soy protein significantly suppressed the progression of 
collagen II-induced arthritis and inhibited the production of tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, interleukin6, leptin, and adiponectin. Soy protein appeared to be 
a potent immunomodulatory inhibitor of collagen II-induced arthritis in rats. It 
could delay onset of RA and reduced cartilage erosion and synovitis 
inflammation. Therefore, it may be a useful protein in the prevention and 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patient.
