The 4A11 antigen is a unique cytokine-inducible antigen up-regulated on 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial endothelial cells (ECs) compared with normal 
ECs. Previously, we showed that in soluble form, this antigen, Lewis(y)-6/H-5-2 
(Le(y)/H) or its glucose analog, 2-fucosyl lactose (H-2g), induced the 
expression of EC intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and 
leukocyte-endothelial adhesion through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Currently, we show 
that H-2g induces release of EC angiogenic basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an effect inhibited by decoy 
nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). JAK2 and 
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) are 2 upstream kinases of NFkappaB activated by 
H-2g, as confirmed by an inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKKbeta) assay. In vitro, 
H-2g induces vascular sprouting in the rat aortic ring model, whereas blockade 
of JAK2, PI3K, or NFkappaB inhibits sprouting. Likewise, in the in vivo mouse 
Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay, chemical inhibitors and antisense or decoy 
ODNs of JAK2, PI3K, or NFkappaB decrease angiogenesis, confirming the importance 
of these pathways in H-2g-induced EC signaling. The critical role of Le(y)/H 
involvement in angiogenesis and its signaling pathways may provide new targets 
for therapy of diseases characterized by pathologic neovascularization.
