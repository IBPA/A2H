The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by inflammation. 
We aimed to examine the roles of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase 
(PKR) and high-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) in a rat model 
of RA. Male SD rats were divided into three groups: control, RA model, and 
intervention (RA model plus treatment). The model of RA was made by injecting 
Freund's adjuvant into the posterior right limb of the rat and the intervention 
group received a PKR-specific inhibitor C16 after RA modeling. The degree of 
limb swelling was measured following RA modeling and intervention. In addition, 
plasma levels of HMGB1 were determined using ELISA. The mRNA and protein levels 
of PKR and HMGB1 were detected in rat synovium using quantitative PCR and 
western blot, respectively. The degree of limb swelling in the RA model was 
increased compared to control, while it was decreased in the intervention model 
compared to the RA model. Plasma HMGB1 levels in the model group were 
significantly higher compared to the control group but were lower in the 
intervention group compared to the model group. PKR and HMGB1 protein and mRNA 
levels in the rat synovium were elevated in the model group and markedly reduced 
in the intervention group. Increased levels of PKR and HMGB1 in synovium or 
blood appear to be involved in the occurrence and development of RA in a rat 
model. Selective inhibition of PKR improves the symptoms of RA, perhaps by 
inhibiting the release of HMGB1.
