The CTLA4-Ig fusion proteins abatacept and belatacept inhibit CD28-mediated T 
cell activation by binding CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) costimulatory ligands and 
are clinically proven immunosuppressants used for rheumatoid arthritis and renal 
transplantation, respectively. Abatacept and belatacept preferentially bind 
CD80, yet CD86 has been implicated as the dominant ligand for CD28-mediated 
costimulation of T cells. We investigated the immunosuppressive effects of 
ASP2408, a novel CTLA4-Ig with CD86 selectivity and high potency created by 
directed evolution methods. Here we evaluated the effect of ASP2408 in vitro 
using cynomolgus monkey and rat T cell proliferation assays and in vivo using 
cynomolgus monkey tetanus toxoid (TTx) immunization and a rat rheumatoid 
arthritis model. ASP2408 was 290-fold and 21-fold more potent in suppressing in 
vitro monkey T cell proliferation than abatacept and belatacept, respectively. 
ASP2408 inhibited anti-TTx immunological reactions in cynomolgus monkey at a 
10-fold lower dose level than belatacept, through complete CD86 and partial CD80 
receptor occupancies, and also suppressed inflammation in the rat 
collagen-induced arthritis model. Overall, improved immunosuppressive potency of 
ASP2408 relative to abatacept and belatacept correlated well with improved CD86 
binding affinity. These results may support the advantage of preferential 
enhancement of CD86 binding affinity to inhibit T cell-mediated immune response 
and improved dosing convenience in humans relative to abatacept or belatacept.
