The covalent transfer of heavy chains (HCs) from inter-α-inhibitor (IαI) to 
hyaluronan (HA) via the protein product of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated 
gene-6 (TSG-6) forms the HC-HA complex, a pathological form of HA that promotes 
the adhesion of leukocytes to HA matrices. The transfer of HCs to high molecular 
weight (HMW) HA is a reversible event whereby TSG-6 can shuffle HCs from one HA 
molecule to another. Therefore, HMW HA can serve as both an HC acceptor and an 
HC donor. In the present study, we show that transfer of HCs to low molecular 
weight HA oligosaccharides is an irreversible event where subsequent shuffling 
does not occur, i.e. HA oligosaccharides from 8 to 21 monosaccharide units in 
length can serve as HC acceptors, but are unable to function as HC donors. We 
show that the HC-HA complex is present in the synovial fluid of mice subjected 
to systemic and monoarticular mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, 
we demonstrate that HA oligosaccharides can be used, with TSG-6, to irreversibly 
shuffle HCs from pathological, HMW HC-HA to HA oligosaccharides, thereby 
restoring HC-HA matrices from the inflamed joint to their normal state, 
unmodified with HCs. This process was also effective for HC-HA in the synovial 
fluid of human rheumatoid arthritis patients (in vitro).
