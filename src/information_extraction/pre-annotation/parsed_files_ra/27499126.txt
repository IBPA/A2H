Diflunisal (DIF) is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment 
of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis. The current engrossment was aimed at 
formulation and assessment of DIF-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for 
topical/dermal application. SLNs formulated by hot homogenisation method based 
on microemulsification technique were spherical with a mean size of 
124.0 ± 2.07 nm; PDI 0.294 ± 0.15. The cumulative amount permeated/area was 
109.99 ± 0.008 μg/cm(2), along with permeation flux (6.30 ± 0.09 μg/cm(2)/h) and 
skin retention (11.74 ± 0.155 μg/cm(2)) across mice skin. The SLNs of DIF showed 
significant decrease in fluid volume, granuloma tissue weight, leukocyte 
count/mm(3) after application of SLN formulation in mice air pouch model. 
Similarly, in mice ear oedema and rat paw oedema model, there was 2.30 and 1.29 
time increase in percentage inhibition of oedema after SLN formulation 
application, respectively, as compared with conventional cream. Hence, the SLNs 
of DIF may prove to be a potential nanocarrier to effectively treat the local 
inflammatory conditions associated with arthritis.
