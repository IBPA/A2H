Notopterygium incisum (QH) has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), and volatile oils may be its mainly bioactive constituents. The 
present study was designed to analyze the volatile compounds in QH and to 
determine the anti-arthritic capacity of Notopterygium volatile oils and the 
potential mechanism of action. The volatile compounds analysis was conducted by 
GC-MS. The anti-arthritic capacity test of the volatile oils was conducted on 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. The anti-inflammatory property was tested 
in NO release model in RAW 264.7 cells. Endothelial cells were used to evaluate 
the anti-proliferative and anti-tube formative effects. 70 compounds were 
analyzed by GC-MS in the volatile oils. Notopterygium volatile oils weakened the 
rat AIA in a dose-dependent manner (2, 4, and 8 g crude drug/kg). The NO 
production by RAW 264.7 was decreased by more than 50% in Notopterygium volatile 
oils (5, 15, and 45 μg·mL-1) pretreated groups. Notopterygium volatile oils also 
inhibited EAhy926 cell proliferation and further delayed EAhy926 cell capillary 
tube formation in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-NO productive, 
anti-proliferative, and anti-tube formative effects of Notopterygium volatile 
oils strongly suggested that the therapeutic effect of QH in AIA might be 
related to the potent anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic capacities of the 
volatile oils.
