Orexin-A has been shown to modulate pain sensation and increase appetite. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by joint destruction, deformity, 
hyperalgesia, and weight reduction.
AIM: Evaluate the possible effect of orexin-A on hyperalgesic and cachectic 
manifestations in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model.
METHODS: Forty adult male Wistar rats were distributed among 4 groups; I, normal 
controls; II, rats with AIA induced by intradermal injection of Mycobacterium 
butyricum, but with no other treatment; III, AIA rats treated daily with an 
intravenous injection of orexin-A for 8 days; and IV, AIA rats treated orally 
with dexamethasone for 8 days. The parameters we assessed were pain-associated 
behavior, body mass, hind paw volume, serum levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) 
and neuropeptide Y (NPY).
RESULTS: Orexin-A caused a significant reduction in pain sensation and NGF 
levels, and increased body mass and the levels of NPY, whereas treatment with 
dexamethasone led to significant reductions in paw swelling and pain sensation.
CONCLUSION: Orexin-A has hypoalgesic properties and increases body mass, whereas 
dexamethasone has a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, the combination 
of orexin-A and dexamethasone should have a greater effect with respect to 
attenuating the manifestations and complications associated with RA.
