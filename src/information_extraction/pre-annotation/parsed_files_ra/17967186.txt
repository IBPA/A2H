Many genetically modified mouse strains are now available on a C57BL/6 (H-2b) 
background, a strain that is relatively resistant to collagen-induced arthritis. 
To facilitate the molecular understanding of autoimmune arthritis, we 
characterised the induction of arthritis in C57BL/6 mice and then validated the 
disease as a relevant pre-clinical model for rheumatoid arthritis. C57BL/6 mice 
were immunised with type II collagen using different protocols, and arthritis 
incidence, severity, and response to commonly used anti-arthritic drugs were 
assessed and compared with DBA/1 mice. We confirmed that C57BL/6 mice are 
susceptible to arthritis induced by immunisation with chicken type II collagen 
and develop strong and sustained T-cell responses to type II collagen. Arthritis 
was milder in C57BL/6 mice than DBA/1 mice and more closely resembled rheumatoid 
arthritis in its response to therapeutic intervention. Our findings show that 
C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, providing a valuable 
model for assessing the role of specific genes involved in the induction and/or 
maintenance of arthritis and for evaluating the efficacy of novel drugs, 
particularly those targeted at T cells.
