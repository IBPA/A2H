Arthrogenic alphaviruses, such as Ross River virus (RRV), chikungunya, Sindbis, 
mayaro and o'nyong-nyong viruses circulate endemically worldwide, frequently 
causing outbreaks of polyarthritis. The exact mechanisms of how alphaviruses 
induce polyarthritis remain ill defined, although macrophages are known to play 
a key role. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important 
cytokine involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. Here, we characterize 
the role of MIF in alphavirus-induced arthritides using a mouse model of 
RRV-induced arthritis, which has many characteristics of RRV disease in humans. 
RRV-infected WT mice developed severe disease associated with up-regulated MIF 
expression in serum and tissues, which corresponded to severe inflammation and 
tissue damage. MIF-deficient (MIF(-/-)) mice developed mild disease accompanied 
by a reduction in inflammatory infiltrates and muscle destruction in the 
tissues, despite having viral titers similar to WT mice. In addition, 
reconstitution of MIF into MIF(-/-) mice exacerbated RRV disease and treatment 
of mice with MIF antagonist ameliorated disease in WT mice. Collectively, these 
findings suggest that MIF plays a critical role in determining the clinical 
severity of alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease and may provide a target 
for the development of antiviral pharmaceuticals. The prospect being that early 
treatment with MIF-blocking pharmaceuticals may curtail the debilitating 
arthritis associated with alphaviral infections.
