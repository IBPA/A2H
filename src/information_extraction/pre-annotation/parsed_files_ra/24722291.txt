The pathology of rheumatoid arthritis includes synoviocyte proliferation and 
inflammatory mediator expression, which may result from dysregulated epigenetic 
control by histone deacetylase (HDAC). Thus, HDAC inhibitors may be useful for 
treating inflammatory disease. This was a preclinical study of the HDAC 
inhibitor, MPT0G009. The IC50 values of MPT0G009 for HDAC1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 
enzymatic activities were significantly lower than those for the currently 
marketed HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat). In 
addition, MPT0G009 markedly inhibited cytokine secretion and macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B 
ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis by macrophages (50 ng/ml each). These MPT0G009 
effects on cytokine secretion and osteoclast formation were reduced by the 
overexpression of HDAC 1 (class I HDAC) and 6 (class II HDAC) in cells, 
suggesting that these effects were due to the inhibition of its activity. In an 
in vivo rat model, oral administration of MPT0G009 (25 mg/kg) significantly 
inhibited paw swelling and bone destruction. Furthermore, compared with SAHA, 
MPT0G009 exhibited longer half-life (9.53 h for oral administration) and higher 
oral bioavailability (13%) in rats. These results established the preclinical 
anti-arthritic efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters of MPT0G009, which may 
provide a new therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory arthritis.
