Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is frequently involved with rheumatoid arthritis 
with a high prevalence that could result in a chronic pain state. Once the 
disease is established in the joint, the antigen-specific immune reaction 
initiates a neuro-immune cascade of events that causes sensitization of the 
central nervous system. This study establishes animal experimental models that 
evaluate the chronicity of albumin-induced arthritis hypernociception in the 
TMJ. Antigen-induced arthritis was generated in rats with methylated bovine 
serum albumin (mBSA) diluted in complete Freund's. Intra-articular injection of 
mBSA (10 µg/TMJ/week) during 3 weeks resulted in a persistent inflammatory 
hypernociception which was characterized by an inflammatory episode 
characterized by the increased of lymphocytes, macrophages and pro-inflammatory 
interleukins IL-12 and IL-18. The persistent model of inflammatory 
hypernociception induced by arthritis in the TMJ elicited protein levels of P2X7 
receptors, cathepsin S and fractalkine in the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis. 
Overall, the results of the present work suggest that a persistent inflammatory 
hypernociception of albumin-induced arthritis in the TMJ leads to the activation 
of the central nervous system signaling by P2X7/cathepsin S/fractalkine pathway.
