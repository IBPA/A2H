Chronic pain, sickness behaviors, and cognitive decline are symptoms in 
rheumatoid arthritis. In the adjuvant-induced arthritis Lewis rat model, we 
examined the dynamics of c-Fos expression in the hippocampus, a brain region 
important for these symptoms. Brain sections were stained for c-Fos using 
immunohistochemistry. c-Fos-positive nuclei were counted in CA1, CA2, CA3 and 
the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampi from rats receiving no treatment or 
base-of-the-tail injections of (1 or 2) incomplete or complete Freund's adjuvant 
(low- or high-dose), (3), Mycobacterium butyricum cell wall suspended in saline, 
or (4) saline, and sacrificed 4, 14, 21, or 126days post-immunization. Disease 
severity was evaluated by dorsoplantar foot pad widths and X-ray analysis. We 
report sustained dose- and subfield-dependent c-Fos expression with arthritis, 
but transient expression in nonarthritic groups, suggesting long-term genomic 
changes in rheumatoid arthritis that may be causal for behavioral changes, 
adaptation to chronic pain and/or cognitive decline associated with disease.
