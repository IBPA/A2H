Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a degenerative joint disease that is caused by 
multiple pathogenic factors. However, the precise etiology of RA is still 
unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that acid-sensing ion channel 1a 
(ASIC1a)-mediated articular chondrocyte apoptosis played a key role in the 
progression of RA. In this study, we aim to explore whether ASIC1a mediates 
autophagy or not and the effect of autophagy on ASIC1a-mediated apoptosis. 
Primary articular chondrocytes, extracted from rat knee joints, were exposed to 
different concentrations of concentrated hydrochloric acid for different time 
intervals in vitro. The results indicated that extracellular acid treatment 
induced autophagy of rat articular chondrocytes. Moreover, inhibition of ASIC1a 
with either psalmotoxin 1 or ASIC1a short hairpin RNA reduced the autophagy 
flux. The results suggested that ASIC1a mediated acid-induced autophagy. 
Pretreatment with autophagy antagonist 3-methyladenine decreased the autophagy, 
but increased the apoptosis mediated by ASIC1a. Furthermore, knockdown of Beclin 
1 by small interfering RNA attenuated autophagy but potentiated ASIC1a-mediated 
apoptosis of rat articular chondrocytes. Taken together, these findings 
suggested that both inhibition and silencing of autophagy could enhance 
ASIC1a-mediated apoptosis in rat articular chondrocytes, and therefore, 
autophagy is likely to be a new mechanism involved in ASIC1a-mediated apoptosis 
of articular chondrocytes during the pathogenesis of RA.
