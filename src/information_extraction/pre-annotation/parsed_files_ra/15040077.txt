AIM: To study the effects of TNF receptor blocking peptide on adjuvant arthritis 
in rats.
METHODS: The model of rat adjuvant arthritis was induced by injection of 
complete Freund's adjuvant. The TNF receptor blocking peptide was injected 
locally in the ankle. The ankle swelling, the pathologic changes in the ankle 
joint and the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA and TNF-alpha mRNA by peritoneal 
macrophages (RT-PCR) were observed.
RESULTS: The model of rat adjuvant arthritis induced by injection of complete 
Freund's adjuvant was similar to human rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment with 
TNF receptor blocking peptide for 10 days resulted in complete inhibition of 
joint swelling, a decrease in infiltration of inflammatory cell into joint 
tissue, an obvious alleviation of inflammatory pathological damages and an 
apparent decline of TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-1 beta mRNA of peritoneal macrophages 
of rats.
CONCLUSION: The TNF receptor blocking peptide can protect the joint from 
inflammatory damage induced by adjuvant arthritis by suppression of TNF-alpha 
and IL-1 production, thereby alleviating the pathological injury of joint and 
controlling effectively the clinic course of arthritis.
