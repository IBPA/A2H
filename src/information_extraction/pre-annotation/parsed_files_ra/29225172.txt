Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a protein expressed by macrophages 
infiltrating the area around the coronary arteries in a rat ectopic cardiac 
allograft model. We previously reported that AIF-1 is associated with the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and skin fibrosis in sclerodermatous 
graft-versus-host disease mice. Here, we used an animal model of 
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis to analyze the expression of AIF-1 and examine 
its function in lung fibrosis. The results showed that AIF-1 was expressed on 
lung tissues, specifically macrophages, from mice with bleomycin-induced lung 
fibrosis. Recombinant AIF-1 increased the production of TGF-Î² which plays 
crucial roles in the mechanism of fibrosis by mouse macrophage cell line 
RAW264.7. Recombinant AIF-1 also increased both the proliferation and migration 
of lung fibroblasts compared with control group. These results suggest that 
AIF-1 plays an important role in the mechanism underlying lung fibrosis, and may 
provide an attractive new therapeutic target.
