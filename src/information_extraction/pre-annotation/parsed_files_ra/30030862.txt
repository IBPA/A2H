BACKGROUND: E6011, a humanized antifractalkine monoclonal antibody, is under 
development for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis. A reproducible assay method has been developed for the 
determination of E6011 in monkey and human serum by electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL) assay.
METHODS: E6011 in serum was captured by fractalkine and detected by 
ruthenium-labeled rabbit anti-E6011 Fab polyclonal antibodies for ECL detection. 
E6011 in serum was quantifiable from 0.02 and 0.1 μg/mL in monkey and human 
serum, respectively, with minimum required dilution of 500. The method was then 
validated in accordance with bioanalytical guidelines.
RESULTS: Accuracy and precision of quality control samples at five 
concentrations in intra- and interbatch reproducibility demonstrated that 
relative error and relative standard deviation were within acceptable criteria. 
Recovery of E6011 was 92.9%-121.7% and 85.0%-109.3% in humans and monkeys. 
Dilution integrity, no prozone effects, and no impacts by antigen were also 
ensured. Parallelism was also confirmed using incurred clinical sample analysis. 
Various types of stability were assessed, which confirmed that E6011 in serum 
was stable for 367 and 735 days in monkey and human sera, respectively, under 
frozen conditions.
CONCLUSION: The developed method was successfully applied supporting 
pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys and humans.
