OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of geniposide on serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha 
levels of rheumatoid arthritis rats, as well as the mechanism of this drug.
METHOD: To establish an experimental rat model of type II collagen-induced 
arthritic (CIA). The inhibitory effects on paw edema were observed, and serum 
IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were determined in experimental rats.
RESULT: Compared with the model, geniposide delayed the starting time of right 
paw edema significantly, and the levels of serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were 
significantly decreased by geniposide at high dose or medium dose (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Geniposide can lower serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels in 
rheumatoid arthritis rats. The effect may be close related to inhibitory 
development of rheumatoid arthritis by the agent.
