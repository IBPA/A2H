The collagenase cathepsin K has been shown important in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Icariin is the major pharmacologically active 
flavonol diglycoside of Herba Epimedii, an herb used in Chinese traditional 
medicine to treat arthritis. We investigated whether icariin can inhibit the 
protease activity of cathepsin K and its effects on a murine model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Six-week old female BALB/C mice were immunized 
with type II collagen and treated with vehicle alone icariin (25mg/kg) for 21 
days; a control remained untreated. Serum concentrations of type I collagen 
C-terminal telopeptide (CTX-I) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) 
and urinary concentrations of deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were measured, and disease 
severity was assessed. Compared with immunized, untreated mice, immunized 
icariin-treated mice had significantly lower urinary DPD (~25%, p<0.01) and 
serum COMP (~11.9%, p<0.01) concentrations, with serum CTX-1 (RatLaps) 
concentrations being significantly lower in immunized, icariin treated mice than 
in immunized, vehicle treated (p<0.01) and non-immunized (p<0.005) mice. Icariin 
also reduced the clinical signs of arthritis. Icariin inhibited cathpesin K 
activity in vitro and was effective in a mouse model of CIA similar to human RA, 
suggesting that this agent may have promise in the treatment of patients with 
RA.
