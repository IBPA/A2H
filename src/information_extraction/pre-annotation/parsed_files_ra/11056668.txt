STATEMENT OF FINDINGS: The kinetics of apoptosis and the apoptosis-regulating 
gene p53 in adjuvant arthritis (AA) were investigated to assess the value of the 
AA rat model for testing apoptosis-inducing therapies. Very few terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick 
end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected during the early phases of AA, 
but on day 23 (chronic arthritis) the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was 
significantly increased. Expression of p53 in synovial tissue gradually 
increased from days 5-23, which was markedly higher than p53 levels in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium. Significant apoptosis only occurs late in 
rat AA and is concordant with marked p53 overexpression, making it useful model 
for testing proapoptotic therapies, but rat AA is not the best model for p53 
gene therapy because dramatic p53 overexpression occurs in the latter stages of 
the disease.
