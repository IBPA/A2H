INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
characterized by synovial hyperplasia and progressive cartilage and bone 
destruction that leads to a substantial loss of general functions and/or a 
decline in physical activities such as walking speed in humans. The K/BxN serum 
transfer arthritis in mice shares many immunological and pathological features 
with human RA. Very few studies are available in mice that investigate the 
changes in physical activity in relation to arthritis development. In this study 
we investigate the effect of arthritis on the locomotor activity of mice during 
K/BxN sera transfer arthritis.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced in Balb/c mice by injecting intraperitoneally 
with 200ul of K/BxN sera; Balb/c mice injected with phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS) served as control. Progress of arthritis was estimated by daily 
measurements of joint thickness. Each mouse's locomotor activity (travel 
distance and travel time) was assessed every day for duration of 20 minute 
period using the SmartCage™ platform. Data were analyzed using the SmartCage™ 
analysis software (CageScore™).
RESULTS: Arthritic Balb/c mice showed a reduction in distance covered and travel 
speed when compared to arthritis-free, control Balb/c mice. Maximum decline in 
locomotor activity was observed during the peak period of the disease and 
correlated to the increase in joint thickness in the arthritic mice.
CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that measuring locomotor activity of mice 
during progression of K/BxN sera-induced arthritis using the SmartCage™ platform 
offers a quantitative method to assess physical activity in mice during 
arthritis.
