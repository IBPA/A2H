Abstract Many animal models have been developed for a study of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). However, RA animal models are not always similar to RA patients 
in their response to antirheumatic drugs. Recently, humanized monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) has been developed for the treatment of RA, but at present there 
is no animal model on which to screen this mAb therapy because of problems with 
cross-reactivity. We therefore considered the development of a novel animal 
model for the screening of antirheumatic drugs using the severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse in order to prevent the rejection of human 
transplant cells. Following subcutaneous implantation of synovial tissue in the 
SCID mouse, all target cells within the SCID-HuRAg mouse were of human origin, 
having migrated from the implanted tissue. Moreover, human interlukin-6 and 
rheumatoid factor were detected in this mouse serum. We therefore propose that 
this SCID-HuRAg mouse is a novel, useful animal model for the study and 
development of new drugs for RA patients. This novel RA animal model is reviewed 
in this chapter.
