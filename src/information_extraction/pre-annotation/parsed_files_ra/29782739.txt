The influence of melatonin on the reduced glutathione content, activity of 
glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione transferase in 
blood serum, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle of rats under conditions of 
experimental rheumatoid arthritis development has been estimated. A change in 
these parameters toward normal control values under the action of hormone has 
been revealed. The results can be related to realization of the melatonin 
antioxidant and protective properties under conditions of oxidative stress 
accompanying the development of rheumatoid arthritis.
