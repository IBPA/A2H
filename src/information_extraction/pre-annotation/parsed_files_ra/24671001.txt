The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β is a clinical target in many 
conditions involving dysregulation of the immune system; therapeutics that block 
IL-1β have been approved to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory diseases, cryopyrin-associated periodic 
syndromes, active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Here, we report the 
generation and engineering of a new fully human antibody that binds tightly to 
IL-1β with a neutralization potency more than 10 times higher than that of the 
marketed antibody canakinumab. After affinity maturation, the derived antibody 
shows a>30-fold increased affinity to human IL-1β compared with its parent 
antibody. This anti-human IL-1β IgG also cross-reacts with mouse and monkey 
IL-1β, hence facilitating preclinical development. In a number of mouse models, 
this antibody efficiently reduced or abolished signs of disease associated with 
IL-1β pathology. Due to its high affinity for the cytokine and its potency both 
in vitro and in vivo, we propose that this novel fully human anti-IL-1β 
monoclonal antibody is a promising therapeutic candidate and a potential 
alternative to the current therapeutic arsenal.
