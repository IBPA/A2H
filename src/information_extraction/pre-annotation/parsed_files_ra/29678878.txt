Despite the success of current biological therapeutics for rheumatoid arthritis, 
these therapies, targeting individual cytokines or pathways, produce beneficial 
responses in only about half of patients. Therefore, better therapeutics are 
needed. IL-6 and IL-17A are proinflammatory cytokines in many autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases, and several therapeutics have been developed to 
specifically inhibit them. However, targeting both of these cytokines with a 
bispecific therapeutic agent could account for their nonoverlapping 
proinflammatory functions and for the fact that IL-6 and IL-17A act in a 
positive feedback loop. Here, we present the development of MT-6194, a 
bispecific antibody targeting both IL-6R and IL-17A that was developed with the 
FynomAb technology. We also present data from mouse inflammatory disease 
experiments, indicating that simultaneous inhibition of both IL-6 and IL-17A 
yields enhanced efficacy compared with inhibition of each cytokine alone.
