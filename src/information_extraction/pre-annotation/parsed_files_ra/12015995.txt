In this review we list from literature investigations on rat serum proteins 
using electrophoretic techniques in connection with drug testing. From our own 
research work, we provide annotated two-dimensional maps of rat serum proteins 
under control and experimental conditions. Emphasis is on species-specific 
components and on the effects of acute and chronic inflammation. We discuss our 
project of structural proteomics on rat serum as a minimally invasive approach 
to pharmacological investigation, and we outline a typical experimental plan for 
drug testing according to the above guidelines. We then report in detail on the 
results of our trials of anti-inflammatory drugs on adjuvant arthritis, an 
animal model of disease resembling in many aspects human rheumatoid arthritis. 
We demonstrate a correlation between biochemical parameters and therapeutic 
findings and outline the advantages of the chosen methodological approach, which 
proved also sensitive in revealing "side effects" of the test drugs. In an 
appendix we describe our experimental protocol when performing two-dimensional 
electrophoresis of rat serum.
