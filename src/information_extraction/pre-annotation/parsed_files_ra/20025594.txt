Significant progress has been made in past decades in our understanding of the 
basic mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, many questions 
remain unanswered, in particular regarding the mechanisms at very early stages 
of these diseases. Reliable animal models are of crucial importance in basic 
research and may help us to understand central disease pathways. They are also 
indispensable for pre-clinical drug testing. Here we present and discuss two 
mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, respectively. In 
experimental studies using the models of collagen-induced arthritis and 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the efficacy of new biological agents 
has been tested, which paved the way for clinical trials. A further interesting 
field where mouse models may provide valuable informations, is the 
identification of susceptibility genes for autoimmune diseases. Overall, in some 
instances studies with inbred strains may have an advantage over human studies, 
because environmental factors may easily be controlled and the genetic 
differences between different mouse strains are better characterized.
