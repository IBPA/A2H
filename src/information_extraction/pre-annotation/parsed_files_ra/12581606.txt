Intra-articular hypoxia in the inflamed rheumatoid joint is associated with 
increased cell proliferation, enhanced metabolism and compromised vascular 
perfusion. Recent clinical studies using direct measurements of hypoxia in 
rheumatoid joints have delineated up to 20% of soft tissue pO(2) readings as 
below 10mm Hg. Increased markers for glycolysis exist in rheumatoid synovial 
fluid and upregulation of tissue glycolytic enzymes occurs in a rat model of 
synovitis. Recent reports show arthritis is provoked by linked T and B cell 
lymphocyte recognition of the glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 
(GPI). This suggests an unusual physiological feature of rheumatoid joints leads 
to autoimmune destruction. In this report I suggest that hypoxia, within the 
rheumatoid joint, leads to upregulation of the glycolytic enzyme GPI which in 
turn perpetuates rheumatoid arthritis.
