Zhengqing Fengtongning (ZQFTN), the pharmaceutical preparation of sinomenine 
(SIN) derived from the medicinal plant Sinmenium acutum, is well-known in China 
as an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, its 
histamine-release anaphylactoid reactions (HRARs) occur often in some patients. 
Therefore, it is desirable to establish effective clinical protocols to manage 
such HRARs. In the study, rat models with systemic HRARs and local HRARs of the 
skin were established. The level of vascular permeability and mast cell numbers 
was determined by quantitative analysis using Evans blue dye and histological 
assays. The levels of histamine, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and IL-33 in plasma were 
detected by UHPLC-SPE-MS, ELISA and immunohistochemistry assays, respectively. 
The results demonstrated that SIN significantly induced both systemic and local 
HRARs in rats, showing significant decrease of body temperature, increases in 
vascular permeability in skin, injury of lung tissues and mast cell infiltration 
and IL-33 expression in skin and lung tissues. Mechanistic study showed that 
tranilast could prevent SIN-triggered HRARs via inhibition of H1 receptor gene 
expression and NF-ÎºB signaling. Our findings provide evidence that mast cell 
membrane stabilizers and H1 receptor blockers effectively prevent SIN-induced 
HRARs, and cromolyn, cetirizine and tranilast can be used in the clinic for the 
management of HRARs induced by ZQFTN.
