Active rheumatoid arthritis originates from few joints but subsequently affects 
the majority of joints. Thus far, the pathways of the progression of the disease 
are largely unknown. As rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) which 
can be found in RA synovium are key players in joint destruction and are able to 
migrate in vitro, we evaluated the potential of RASFs to spread the disease in 
vivo. To simulate the primary joint of origin, we implanted healthy human 
cartilage together with RASFs subcutaneously into severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice. At the contralateral flank, we implanted healthy 
cartilage without cells. RASFs showed an active movement to the naive cartilage 
via the vasculature independent of the site of application of RASFs into the 
SCID mouse, leading to a marked destruction of the target cartilage. These 
findings support the hypothesis that the characteristic clinical phenomenon of 
destructive arthritis spreading between joints is mediated, at least in part, by 
the transmigration of activated RASFs.
