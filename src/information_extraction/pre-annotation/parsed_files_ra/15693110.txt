Characterization of the K/BxN mouse model of spontaneous arthritis contributed 
to the rediscovery of immune complex-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Serum from these animals can transfer joint-specific 
inflammation to normal mice. Fc receptors, interleukin 1, mast cells, and 
complement are all essential for the development of arthritis after serum 
transfer. In RA, additional amplifying factors have been identified, including 
cytokines and intracellular signaling molecules, such as mitogen-activated 
protein kinases and nuclear factor kappa B, that perpetuate inflammation. 
Understanding the autoimmune and inflammatory pathways implicated in disease has 
led to targeted drug development and improved clinical outcomes.
