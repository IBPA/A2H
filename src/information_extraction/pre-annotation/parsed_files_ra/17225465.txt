Mizoribine (MZR) has been shown to possess immunosuppressive activity that 
selectively inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes by interfering with 
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. The efficacy of MZR is not only in patients 
who have had renal transplantation, but also in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), lupus nephritis, and primary nephritic syndrome. Because the 
exact mechanism of its immunosuppressive action is not clear, the object of this 
study was to examine the ability of MZR to regulate the antigen presenting cells 
(APCs), dendritic cells (DCs). In this work, we tested whether MZR (1-10 
microg/mL) could inhibit the cross-presentation of DCs. DC2.4 cells (H-2K(b)) or 
bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) generated from BM cells of C57BL/6 mouse 
(H-2K(b)) were cultured in the presence of MZR with OVA-microspheres, and the 
amount of OVA peptide-class I MHC complexes was measured by a T cell hybridoma, 
B3Z, that recognizes OVA (257-264 : SIINFEKL)-H-2Kb complex and 
expresses-galactosidase. MZR profoundly inhibited the expression of 
SIINFEKL-H-2K(b) complexes. This inhibitory activity of MZR appeared to affect 
the phagocytic activity of DCs. MZR also decreased IL-2 production when we 
examined the effects of MZR on CD4+ T cells. These results provide an 
understanding of the mechanism of immunosuppressive activity of MZR on the 
inhibition of MHC-restricted antigen presentation and phagocytic activity in 
relation to their actions on APCs.
