An array of investigations has revealed that macrophage migration inhibitory 
factor (MIF) plays an important role in the exacerbation of a wide range of 
inflammatory diseases. For the past two decades, we have extensively studied 
MIF's pathophysiological roles in human diseases, and have accumulated evidence 
elucidating its molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of immune disorders and 
inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel 
diseases (IBD). In a study of IBD, we demonstrated for the first time that 
anti-MIF antibody suppressed the degree of dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
colitis, indicating its potential therapeutic use for IBD patients. Following 
that report, a number of researchers, including us, clarified that MIF was 
profoundly involved in various gastrointestinal disorders, such as hepatitis and 
pancreatitis. We recently revealed that a MIF-deficient mouse was resistant to a 
challenge of DSS, and showed few clinical and pathological signs. Currently, we 
are developing new therapeutic approaches targeting MIF in inflammatory 
disorders, particularly IBD. We here overview MIF's pathophysiological function, 
mainly in IBD, and introduce two therapeutic approaches, anti-MIF antibody 
treatment and MIF-antisense therapy, via a drug delivery system using 1,3-beta 
glucan.
