OBJECTIVE: The peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) gene and PAD4 autoantibodies 
have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its pathogenesis. 
Therefore, methods for accurately determining their levels in the peripheral 
blood of these patients would be a diagnostic asset. The objective of our study 
was to adapt the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for evaluating 
PAD4 levels in human blood.
METHODS: We prepared recombinant human (h)PAD1, -2, -3, and -4 proteins to 
develop mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to hPAD4. We then generated six 
monoclonal antibodies against hPAD4 and developed two new sandwich ELISA methods 
for evaluating hPAD4 and PAD4 autoantibodies in the peripheral blood from 32 
patients with RA, ten patients with osteoarthrosis, and 20 healthy individuals.
RESULTS: The distribution of hPAD4 in the patients' plasma was determined. Two 
populations were identified: one group with high hPAD4 levels (>0.57 ng/mL) and 
a second group with near-zero levels (<0.1 ng/mL). Most patients approximating 
zero hPAD4 levels had PAD4 autoantibodies. In contrast, most of those with 
higher plasma hPAD4 levels did not have detectable PAD4 autoantibodies.
CONCLUSION: The combination of these sandwich ELISA methods may be a potentially 
beneficial clinical tool for diagnosing RA.
