The p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key signaling molecule that 
plays a crucial role in the progression of various inflammatory diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The 
objective of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of 
a p38 MAPK inhibitor, AW-814141. AW-814141 inhibited enzymatic activity of 
recombinant p38-alpha and beta isoforms with IC(50) value of 100nM and 158nM, 
respectively. AW-814141 also inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-alpha by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells with an IC(50) value of 212nM and demonstrated selectivity 
against a panel of few kinases. Oral administration of AW-814141 (10mpk) in 
LPS-injected mice resulted in a significant reduction in TNF-alpha production in 
the circulation. In a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model and 
collagen-induced arthritis model (CIA), AW-814141 dose dependently inhibited paw 
swelling. In different in vivo efficacy models, efficacy of AW-814141 was found 
to be better as compared to the reference compounds (Vx-745 and BIRB-796). This 
study demonstrated that AW-814141 is a novel p38 MAPK inhibitor and it displays 
promising in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities and can be used for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
