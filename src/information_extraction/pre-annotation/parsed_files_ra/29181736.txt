Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that may cause bone 
damage and worsening disability. Manipulating antigen-specific Treg cells is a 
promising approach to treat autoimmune disease since the immune suppressive 
function of Treg cells has the feature of antigen specificity which could avoid 
overall immune suppression. It has been known that the function of Treg cells is 
impaired in RA, and adoptive transfer of Treg cells is effective in suppressing 
RA. Here, we designed a new approach to generate antigen-specific Treg cells by 
culturing CD4+ T cells from mice with RA onset, and we also proved that the 
adoptive transfer of these antigen-specific Treg cells reversed the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) progression by suppressing the key inflammatory 
cytokine TNF-Î±. Further analysis showed that the transferred Treg cells were 
stable in vivo. These findings suggest this novel approach may have clinical 
applications for treatment of autoimmunity, including RA and other autoimmune 
disorders.
