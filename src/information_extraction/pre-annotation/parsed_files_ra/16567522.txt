Statins, the widely used inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, also have 
immunomodulatory properties. Statins have recently been shown to have beneficial 
prophylactic and therapeutic effects in actively induced, short-term animal 
models of the autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, 
leading to clinical trials. We therefore investigated whether statins' 
protective effects could be reproduced in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a 
spontaneous, chronic model of autoimmune diabetes. Mice were treated with 0, 1, 
10, or 50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) oral atorvastatin from 6 or 12 weeks of age, 
without effect on the rate or prevalence of diabetes development, islet 
infiltration, or islet major histocompatibility complex class II expression. 
However, there was clear evidence of a disease-relevant immunological effect of 
statins in vivo, since short-term (12-day) treatment significantly reduced the 
number of proinflammatory (gamma-interferon-producing) CD8 cells recognizing a 
dominant pathogenic epitope. This effect was absent in mice treated for longer 
periods, suggesting that atorvastatin loses efficiency in inhibiting 
autoantigen-specific T-cells over time. This observation may explain the 
discrepancy between the reported success of statins in acutely induced models 
and the lack of it in a chronic, spontaneous model of autoimmune disease and has 
implications for the adoption of such therapy in humans.
