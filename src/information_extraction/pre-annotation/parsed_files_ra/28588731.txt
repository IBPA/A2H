The bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis in patients with cancer. 
Current treatments for bone metastases include bisphosphonates, denosumab, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics, but each of them has 
certain limitations. Cytokines and mediators released from various cells in the 
bone microenvironment may drive a vicious cycle of osteolytic bone metastases. 
Iguratimod (T-614), a novel disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, has 
demonstrated therapeutic effects by suppressing the production of inflammatory 
cytokines in rats and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the current 
study evaluated the hypothesis that iguratimod may protect against 
cancer-induced bone pain and bone metastasis in a rat model. For this purpose, 
rats inoculated with Walker 256 cells were treated with iguratimod from days 
11-17 post-surgery. Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds and expression levels 
of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (pERK) and c-Fos in the 
spinal cord were investigated to detect changes in bone pain. Bone destruction 
levels were detected using X-rays, hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase staining. The results revealed that mechanical paw withdrawal 
thresholds and the expression levels of pERK and c-Fos declined in a 
dose-dependent manner in rats treated with iguratimod, and bone destruction 
severity was also reduced. These findings may provide important new insights 
into the treatment of bone metastasis symptoms.
