BACKGROUND: Low-level laser is being evaluated for treating rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Recently, the linear polarized infrared light (Super Lizer, SL) 
irradiation may also be useful for RA treatment. However, the molecular 
mechanism underlying the effectiveness of SL on RA is unclear. It has been IL-20 
may involved in RA disease progression.
AIM: To understand how SL action, we constructed the experimental model in vitro 
using human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocyte (MH7A) and collagen induced 
(CIA) RA rat in vivo. We examined the effect of SL irradiation on IL-20 gene 
expression in MH7A and IL-20 protein production in CIA) rat joints.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MH7A was cultured and challenged with IL-1ß, then 
examined IL-20 and IL-20R mRNA level by DNA microarray. IL-20 protein expression 
was examined by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against rat 
IL-20.
RESULT: Scatter plot analysis demonstrated that an increase in IL-20 gene 
expression by IL-1ß was reduced by SL irradiation, but IL-20R did not show a 
significant change. The Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a strong IL-20 
staining in synovial membrane tissue of CIA rat joint, and SL irradiation 
significantly reduced the staining.
DISCUSSION: Since IL-20 has been identified as an important cytokine in the 
pathogenesis of RA, the reduction of IL-20 expression by SL irradiation may be 
one of mechanisms in reduction of inflammation in RA joints by SL irradiation 
suggesting that SL irradiation may be useful for RA therapy.
