Identification of genes controlling complex diseases has proven to be difficult; 
however, animal models may pave the way to determine how low penetrant genes 
interact to promote disease development. We have dissected the Cia5/Eae3 
susceptibility locus on mouse chromosome 3 previously identified to control 
disease in experimental models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Congenic strains showed significant but small effects on severity of both 
diseases. To improve the penetrance, we have now used a new strategy that 
defines the genetic interactions. The QTL interacted with another locus on 
chromosome 15 and a partial advanced intercross breeding of the two congenic 
strains for eight generations accumulated enough statistical power to identify 
interactions with several loci on chromosome 15. Thereby, three separate loci 
within the original QTL could be identified; Cia5 affected the onset of 
arthritis by an additive interaction with Cia31 on chromosome 15, whereas the 
Cia21 and Cia22 affected severity during the chronic phase of the disease 
through an epistatic interaction with Cia32 on chromosome 15. The definition of 
genetic interactions was a prerequisite to dissect the Cia5 QTL and we suggest 
the partial advanced intercross strategy to be helpful also for dissecting other 
QTL controlling complex phenotypes.
