A novel linear multifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dexamethasone (Dex) 
conjugate (click PEG-Dex) was synthesized using facile Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (a click reaction). Dex was conjugated to the click 
PEG via an acid-labile hydrazone bond to allow the drug release in a 
pathophysiological environment. To evaluate click PEG's potential as a versatile 
drug delivery platform, the click PEG-Dex conjugates were tested in an 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rat model. In vivo optical imaging data 
confirmed the arthrotropism of the conjugates in the arthritic rats. A long-term 
treatment study revealed that a single click PEG-Dex conjugate administration 
provided sustained (>15 days) amelioration of ankle joint inflammation to the AA 
rats. Treatment with an equivalent dose of dexamethasone phosphate sodium (free 
Dex) only provided temporal resolution of the arthritis, which recurred upon 
treatment withdrawal. Further histological and bone mineral density comparison 
between the ankle joints from both click PEG-Dex and free Dex treatment groups 
confirmed the superior anti-inflammatory and disease modifying effects of the 
novel polymer-drug conjugates.
