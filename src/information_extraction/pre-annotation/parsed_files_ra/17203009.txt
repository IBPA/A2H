High-mobility group protein 1 (HMG1) is a nonhistone nuclear protein that is a 
prototype of a dual-function alarmin whose immune activity is dependent upon its 
cellular location. Inside the cell, HMG1 binds to DNA and has a role in 
transcriptional regulation. Outside the cell, HMG1 acts as a cytokine and has 
activities that resemble those of tumor necrosis factor. The cytokine activities 
of HMG1 become manifest when this protein translocates from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm and, eventually, into the external milieu; this translocation occurs 
during cell activation and cell death. Given its cytokine activity, HMG1 has 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of immune-mediated diseases 
including arthritis. The role for this protein in arthritis was established by 
observations of the expression of HMG1 in synovial tissue of patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis as well as in the joints of animals used to model 
arthritis. Furthermore, in the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, 
treatment with antibodies to HMG1 or to an inhibitory domain of HMG1 can 
attenuate joint inflammation and damage. These studies identify a novel pathway 
in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis, as well as a new target for 
biologic therapy.
