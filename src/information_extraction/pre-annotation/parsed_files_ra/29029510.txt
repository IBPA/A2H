Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovium and destruction of 
cartilage and bone. Macrophages, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and 
osteoclasts are critical cells driving the pathogenesis of RA. Semaphorin 3A 
(Sema3A) is recently identified as an essential player in the bone homeostasis, 
however its role in RA progression especially in the macrophage polarization are 
poorly understood. In the present study, we found that Sems3A levels were 
significantly decreased in RA serum and synovial fluid compared to OA controls. 
There was a negative correlation between Sema3A levels and RA severity. Using in 
vitro cell cultures, we showed for the first time that Sema3A promoted IL-4 
induced M2 macrophage polarization, whereas prohibited LPS/IFN-Î³ induced M1 
polarization. Sema3A inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cells proliferation and 
migration, suppressed VEGF-mediated invasion and IL-6 production of FLS while 
stimulating their apoptosis. In addition, Sema3A retarded osteoclastogenesis. In 
vivo data demonstrated that Sema3A administration attenuated joint tissue damage 
and the severity of experimental arthritis. Our findings uncovered Sema3A as a 
promising diagnostic biomarker and novel prevention and treatment strategies in 
arthritis treatment.
