Rat bite fever is rare in Western countries. It can be very difficult to 
diagnose as blood cultures are typically negative and a history of rodent 
exposure is often missed. Unless a high index of suspicion is maintained, the 
associated polyarthritis can be mistaken for rheumatoid arthritis. We report a 
case of culture-positive rat bite fever in a 46-year-old female presenting with 
fever and polyarthritis. The clinical presentation mimicked rheumatoid 
arthritis. Infection was complicated by discitis, a rare manifestation. We 
discuss the diagnosis and management of this rare zoonotic infection. We also 
review nine reported cases of rat bite fever, all of which had an initial 
presumptive diagnosis of a rheumatological disorder. Rat bite fever is a 
potentially curable infection but can have a lethal course if left untreated.
