Localised bone loss in the form of bone erosions and peri-articular osteopenia 
constitutes an important criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. In 
the present study, the effect of Semecarpus anacardium Linn. nut milk extract 
(SA) on the metabolism of bone turn over has been studied by analyzing various 
markers of bone turnover and by histological and radiological analysis of the 
joints in adjuvant arthritis in rats. Arthritis was induced in rats by injecting 
Freund's complete adjuvant containing 10mg of heat killed mycobacterium 
tuberculosis in 1 ml paraffin oil (0.1 ml) into the left hind paw of the rat 
intradermally. After 14 days of induction, SA (150 mg/kg body weight/day) was 
administered orally by gastric intubations for 14 days. SA significantly 
reverted the alterations in the bone turnover observed in arthritic animals by 
modulating the levels of calcium, phosphorus and the activities of the enzymes 
names tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, acid phosphatase and alkaline 
phosphatase. The drug increased the bone weights that were found to be decreased 
during arthritis. Protective effect of SA was also observed by the decrease in 
the levels and expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as 
the histopathological and radiological observations. From all these observations 
it can be concluded that SA possesses strong anti-arthritic property by 
regulating bone turnover.
