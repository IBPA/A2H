We examined whether antagonism of the CXCR₄receptor ameliorates the loss of 
renal function following ischemia-reperfusion. CXCR₄is ubiquitously expressed on 
leukocytes, known mediators of renal injury, and on bone marrow hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs). Plerixafor (AMD3100, Mozobil) is a small-molecule 
CXCR₄antagonist that mobilizes HSCs into the peripheral blood and also modulates 
the immune response in in vivo rodent models of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Treatment with plerixafor before and after ischemic clamping ameliorated kidney 
injury in a rat model of bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion. Serum creatinine 
and blood urea nitrogen were significantly reduced 24 h after reperfusion, as 
were tissue injury and cell death. Plerixafor prevented the renal increase in 
the proinflammatory chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL5 and the cytokine IL-6. Flow 
cytometry of kidney homogenates confirmed the presence of significantly fewer 
leukocytes with plerixafor treatment; additionally, myeloperoxidase activity was 
reduced. AMD3465, a monocyclam analog of plerixafor, was similarly 
renoprotective. Four weeks postreperfusion, long-term effects included 
diminished fibrosis, inflammation, and ongoing renal injury. The mechanism by 
which CXCR₄inhibition ameliorates AKI is due to modulation of leukocyte 
infiltration and expression of proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines, rather than 
a HSC-mediated effect. The data suggest that CXCR₄antagonism with plerixafor may 
be a potential option to prevent AKI.
