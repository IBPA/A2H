Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays a key role in 
the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including arthritis. 
Neutralization of this cytokine by anti-TNF-α antibodies has shown its efficacy 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is now widely used. Nevertheless, some patients 
currently treated with anti-TNF-α remain refractory or become nonresponder to 
these treatments. In this context, there is a need for new or complementary 
therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated in vitro and in vivo 
anti-inflammatory potentialities of an anti-TNF-α triplex-forming 
oligonucleotide (TFO), as judged from effects on two rat arthritis models. The 
inhibitory activity of this TFO on articular cells (synoviocytes and 
chondrocytes) was verified and compared to that of small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
in vitro. The use of the anti-TNF-α TFO as a preventive and local treatment in 
both acute and chronic arthritis models significantly reduced disease 
development. Furthermore, the TFO efficiently blocked synovitis and cartilage 
and bone destruction in the joints. The results presented here provide the first 
evidence that gene targeting by anti-TNF-α TFO modulates arthritis in vivo, thus 
providing proof-of-concept that it could be used as therapeutic tool for 
TNF-α-dependent inflammatory disorders.
