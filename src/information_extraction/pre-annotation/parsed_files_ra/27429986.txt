MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). This study was designed to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-21 
on cell proliferation in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of RA. FLS were 
primary-cultured from a rat RA model. RA-FLS and normal FLS were infected with 
lentivirus (anti-miR-21 or pro-miR-21) for overexpression or downregulation of 
miR-21, respectively. The effects of miR-21 overexpression or inhibition on 
nucleoprotein NF-κB levels and FLS cell proliferation were evaluated by western 
blotting and MTT assays. The effects of an inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear 
translocation (BAY 11-7082) were also evaluated. The results showed that the 
levels of miR-21 and nucleoprotein NF-κB were increased in FLS of RA model rats 
compared to the control group. Downregulation of miR-21 in RA FLS led to a 
significant decrease in nucleoprotein NF-κB levels and cell proliferation rates 
compared to the antinegative control (NC) group. However, miR-21 overexpression 
in normal FLS resulted in a significant increase of nucleoprotein NF-κB levels 
and cell proliferation rates compared to the pro-NC group. The effects of miR-21 
overexpression were reversed by BAY 11-7082. We concluded that upregulated 
miR-21 in FLS in RA model rats may promote cell proliferation by facilitating 
NF-κB nuclear translocation, thus affecting the NF-κB pathway.
