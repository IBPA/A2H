Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disorder characterised by 
erosive inflammation of the articular cartilage and by destruction of the 
synovial joints. It is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, and, 
currently, there is no preventative treatment or cure for this disease. 
Genome-wide association studies have identified âˆ¼100 new loci associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to the already known locus within the major 
histocompatibility complex II region. However, together, these loci account for 
only a modest fraction of the genetic variance associated with this disease and 
very little is known about the pathogenic roles of most of the risk loci 
identified. Here, we discuss how rat models of rheumatoid arthritis are being 
used to detect quantitative trait loci that regulate different arthritic traits 
by genetic linkage analysis and to positionally clone the underlying causative 
genes using congenic strains. By isolating specific loci on a fixed genetic 
background, congenic strains overcome the challenges of genetic heterogeneity 
and environmental interactions associated with human studies. Most importantly, 
congenic strains allow functional experimental studies be performed to 
investigate the pathological consequences of natural genetic polymorphisms, as 
illustrated by the discovery of several major disease genes that contribute to 
arthritis in rats. We discuss how these advances have provided new biological 
insights into arthritis in humans.
