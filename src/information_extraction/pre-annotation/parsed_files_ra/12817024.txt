Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder, controlled 
by multiple genes as well as environmental factors. With animal models, like the 
pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, it is possible to reduce the 
environmental effects and the genetic heterogeneity to identify chromosomal 
regions harboring genes responsible for the arthritis development. The PIA model 
has proved to be useful for identifying gene regions controlling different 
phases of the disease based on intercrosses between the resistant E3 and the 
susceptible DA rat. We have now performed a high-powered backcross analysis that 
confirms previous intercross-based data but also identifies additional loci. 
Earlier identified PIA loci were reproduced with high significance; Pia1 (MHC 
region on chromosome 20), Pia4 (chromosome 12), and Pia7 (chromosome 4) are all 
major regulators of PIA severity and were also found to operate in concert. 
These three loci were verified in congenic strains using both disease- and 
arthritis-inflammatory-related subphenotypes as traits. We were also able to 
detect five new quantitative trait loci with dominant effects on PIA: Pia10, 
Pia12, Pia13, Pia14, and Pia15 on chromosomes 10, 6, 7, 8, and 18, respectively. 
These data highlight the usefulness of the statistical power obtained in a 
backcross of a complex disease like arthritis.
