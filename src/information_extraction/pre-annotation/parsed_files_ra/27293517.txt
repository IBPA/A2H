Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. Many 
antioxidants have been tested in arthritis, but their efficacy was, at best, 
marginal. In this study, a novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, 
plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (SkQ1), was tested in vivo to 
prevent and cure experimental autoimmune arthritis. In conventional Wistar rats, 
SkQ1 completely prevented the development of clinical signs of arthritis if 
administered with food before induction. Further, SkQ1 significantly reduced the 
fraction of animals that developed clinical signs of arthritis and severity of 
pathological lesions if administration began immediately after induction of 
arthritis or at the onset of first symptoms (day 14 after induction). In 
specific pathogen-free Wistar rats, SkQ1 administered via gavage after induction 
of arthritis did not reduce the fraction of animals with arthritis but decreased 
the severity of lesions upon pathology examination in a dose-dependent manner. 
Efficacious doses of SkQ1 were in the range of 0.25-1.25 nmol/kg/day 
(0.13-0.7 μg/kg/day), which is much lower than doses commonly used for 
conventional antioxidants. SkQ1 promoted apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro, 
which may be one of the mechanisms underlying its pharmacological activity. 
Considering its low toxicity and the wide therapeutic window, SkQ1 may be a 
valuable additional therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.
