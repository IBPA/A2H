Janus kinases (JAKs) are tyrosine kinases called JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and Tyk-2, 
which have been shown to participate in the signaling pathways of several 
cytokines that are believed to play a key role in several autoimmune-mediated 
disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the availability of 
JAK-specific antibodies to be used in investigative efficacy studies in RA 
models is very limited. Therefore, in this study we developed and characterized 
a JAK-2-specific antibody that was used to evaluate its immunohistochemical 
expression in the joints of a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (rAIA) RA 
preclinical model. An immunogen peptide sequence design was used to generate 
JAK-2-specific mouse, rat, and human polyclonal antibodies. JAK-2 plasmid cDNA 
was then generated and HEK293 transfected cell lines, gel electrophoresis, 
immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to further characterize the 
generated JAK-2 antibodies. We show that the generated JAK-2 antibody exhibits 
specificity and lacks cross-reactivity to JAK-1 and JAK-3. In addition, marked 
JAK-2 expression is shown in the rAIA in mixed inflammatory cells (macrophages 
and neutrophils), mast cells, and bone marrow elements. In conclusion, we show 
the development and characterization of a JAK-2-specific antibody that can be 
used in investigative and mechanistic studies such as preclinical efficacy 
models.
