Stauntonia hexaphylla leaf extract (YRA-1909), which is widely used for the 
antirheumatic properties, has been under phase 2 clinical trials in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis since April 2017. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometric method while using liquid‚Åªliquid extraction with ethyl acetate was 
validated for the simultaneous determination of the major active components of 
YRA-1909, including chlorogenic acid (CGA), neochlorogenic acid (NCGA), 
cryptochlorogenic acid (CCGA), and their metabolites (i.e., caffeic acid (CA), 
caffeic acid 3-O-glucuronide (CA-3-G), caffeic acid 4-O-glucuronide (CA-4-G), 
and ferulic acid (FA)) in rat plasma and applied to a pharmacokinetic study of 
YRA-1909 in rats. Seven analytes were separated on Halo C18 while using gradient 
elution of formic acid and methanol, and then quantified in selected reaction 
monitoring mode whle using negative electrospray ionization. Following oral 
administration of YRA-1909 at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg to male 
Sprague-Dawley rats, CGA, NCGA, and CCGA were rapidly absorbed and metabolized 
to CA, CA-3-G, and CA-4-G. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
(AUClast) of CGA, NCGA, CCGA, and three metabolites linearly increased as the 
YRA-1909 dose increased. Other pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable among 
three doses studied. AUClast values for CA, CA-3-G, and CA-4-G exceeded those 
for CGA, NCGA, and CCGA.
