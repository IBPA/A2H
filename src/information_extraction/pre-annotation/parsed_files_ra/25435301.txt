Piperlonguminine (PL), a key compound from the Piper longum fruit, is known to 
exhibit anti‑tumor and anti‑inflammatory activities. However, little is known 
about its effects on collagen‑induced arthritis (CIA). Fibroblast‑like 
synoviocytes (FLS) have a pivotal role in the development of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Myeloid‑derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are able to suppress T 
cell responses and have important roles in the regulation of autoimmune 
arthritis. The current study investigated whether PL alters the progression of 
RA. It was determined that PL reduces the arthritis score and histopathologic 
lesions in a mouse model of CIA. PL also reduces the expression levels of serum 
anti‑collagen II antibodies (anti‑CⅡ), tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), 
interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑23 and IL‑17 in CIA mice. In draining lymph nodes 
(DLNs), MDSCs were significantly expanded, however, the number of Th17 cells was 
markedly decreased by PL treatment. Additionally, PL reduced secretion of IL‑1β, 
IL‑23 and IL‑17 by TNF‑α‑stimulated human RA FLS. PL significantly inhibited the 
migration and invasion of TNF‑α‑stimulated human RA FLS. These results indicate 
that PL may be a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA, via the 
expansion of MDSCs and the inhibition of the Th17 response and activation of 
FLS.
