INTRODUCTION: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies have a diagnostic role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, little is known about their origins and 
contribution to pathogenesis. Citrullination is the post-translational 
conversion of arginine to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase, and 
increased citrullination of proteins is observed in the joint tissue in RA and 
in brain tissue in multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We applied synovial and myelin protein arrays to examine epitope 
spreading of B cell responses to citrullinated epitopes in both the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for RA and the experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model for MS. Synovial and myelin protein arrays contain 
a spectrum of proteins and peptides, including native and citrullinated forms, 
representing candidate autoantigens in RA and MS, respectively. We applied these 
arrays to characterise the specificity of autoantibodies in serial serum samples 
derived from mice with acute and chronic stages of CIA and EAE.
RESULTS: In samples from pre-disease CIA and acute-disease EAE, we observed 
autoantibody targeting of the immunising antigen and responses to a limited set 
of citrullinated epitopes. Over the course of diseases, the autoantibody 
responses expanded to target multiple citrullinated epitopes in both CIA and 
EAE. Using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 
citrullination of multiple polypeptides in CIA joint and EAE brain tissue that 
have not previously been described as citrullinated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that anti-citrulline antibody responses develop 
in the early stages of CIA and EAE, and that autoimmune inflammation results in 
citrullination of joint proteins in CIA and brain proteins in EAE, thereby 
creating neoantigens that become additional targets in epitope spreading of 
autoimmune responses.
