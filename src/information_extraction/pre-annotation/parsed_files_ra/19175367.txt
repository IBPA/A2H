Patients with chronic, painful diseases often seek alternative therapy. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of hydroalcoholic extract 
of Zingiber officinale rhizomes (Z. officinale extract) to ameliorate 
inflammatory process in rat collagen-induced arthritis. Our results show that Z. 
officinale extract in doses higher than 50 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally starting 
from the dose of booster immunization and for 26 days can ameliorate the 
clinical scores, disease incidence, joint temperature and swelling, and 
cartilage destruction, together with reduction of serum levels of interleukin 
(IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and anti-CII antibodies. 
Moreover, Z. officinale extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg/day was superior to 2 
mg/kg/day of indomethacin at most of the measured parameters. These observations 
might make Z. officinale extract a good alternative to non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
