B cells play important roles in autoimmune diseases ranging from multiple 
sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis. B cells have also long been considered 
central players in systemic lupus erythematosus. However, anti-CD20-mediated B 
cell depletion was not effective in two clinical lupus studies, whereas anti-B 
lymphocyte stimulator, which inhibits B cell survival, was effective. Others and 
we previously found that anti-CD20-based depletion was surprisingly ineffective 
in tissues of lupus-prone mice, but that persistent high doses eventually led to 
depletion and ameliorated lupus. Lupus patients might also have incomplete 
depletion, as suggested in several studies, and which could have led to 
therapeutic failure. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of resistance 
to Ab-mediated cellular depletion in murine lupus. B cells from lupus-prone mice 
were easily depleted when transferred into normal environments or in lupus-prone 
mice that lacked serum Ig. Serum from lupus-prone mice transferred depletion 
resistance, with the active component being IgG. Because depletion is 
FcÎ³R-dependent, we assayed macrophages and neutrophils exposed to lupus mouse 
serum, showing that they are impaired in IgG-mediated phagocytosis. We conclude 
that depletion resistance is an acquired, reversible phagocytic defect depending 
on exposure to lupus serum IgG. These results have implications for optimizing 
and monitoring cellular depletion therapy.
