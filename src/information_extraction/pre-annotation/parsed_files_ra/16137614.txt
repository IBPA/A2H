Anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) antibodies (Abs) solely induce 
arthritis in mice. High titers of anti-GPI Abs are found in some patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their pathogenic role remains elusive. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the pathogenic role of anti-GPI Abs in cynomolgus 
monkeys. IgG fractions were separated from sera of anti-GPI Abs-positive RA 
patients and healthy subjects and directly injected into the metacarpophalangeal 
joints of 4 cynomolgus monkeys. At day 16, the joints were harvested and 
examined histologically and immunohistochemically. The expression of C5a 
receptor (C5aR) molecule in the synovium was quantified by real-time PCR using 
cDNA from monkey joints. In monkey joints, IgG including anti-GPI Abs resulted 
in recruitment of granulocytes and mononuclear cells, strong deposition of human 
IgG on the articular surface, and overexpression of C5aR, but no joint swelling. 
No infiltrated cells or IgG deposition were observed in monkeys injected with 
IgGs from healthy subjects. Our results suggest that IgG fraction from RA 
patients including anti-GPI Abs may play a crucial role in the generation of 
synovitis in monkeys, although the pathogenesis of anti-GPI Abs in RA patients 
is still uncertain.
