B7-H3 is a cell surface molecule in the immunoglobulin superfamily that is 
frequently upregulated in response to autoantigens and pathogens during host T 
cell immune responses. However, B7-H3's role in the differential regulation of T 
cell subsets remains largely unknown. Therefore, we constructed a new B7-H3 
deficient mouse strain (B7-H3 KO) and evaluated the functions of B7-H3 in the 
regulation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets in experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE), experimental asthma, and collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA); these mouse models were used to predict human immune responses in 
multiple sclerosis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Here, we 
demonstrate that B7-H3 KO mice have significantly less inflammation, decreased 
pathogenesis, and limited disease progression in both EAE and CIA mouse models 
when compared with littermates; these results were accompanied by a decrease in 
IFN-Î³ and IL-17 production. In sharp contrast, B7-H3 KO mice developed severe 
ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma with characteristic infiltrations of eosinophils 
in the lung, increased IL-5 and IL-13 in lavage fluid, and elevated IgE anti-OVA 
antibodies in the blood. Our results suggest B7-H3 has a costimulatory function 
on Th1/Th17 but a coinhibitory function on Th2 responses. Our studies reveal 
that B7-H3 could affect different T cell subsets which have important 
implications for regulating pathogenesis and disease progression in human 
autoimmune disease.
