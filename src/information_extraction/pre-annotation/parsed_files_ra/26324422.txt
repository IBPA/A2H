Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a natural plant extract that enhances osteoblast 
activity, and therefore, has the potential to treat osteoclast‑related diseases. 
Such diseases include osteoporosis, periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis 
and aseptic prosthesis loosening. However, data associating the effects of AS‑IV 
on osteoclasts are limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the 
effect of AS‑IV on osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies 
demonstrated that AS‑IV exerts potent inhibitory effects on the ligand of the 
receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB‑induced osteoclastogenesis and revealed 
the mechanism of action of AS‑IV, which inhibited osteoclastogenesis by 
suppression of the extracellular signal‑regulated kinase signaling pathway. The 
in vivo studies proved that AS‑IV attenuated titanium particle‑induced 
osteolysis in a mouse calvarial model. Collectively, the findings of the study 
suggest that AS‑IV is a potential natural agent for the treatment of 
osteoclast-related diseases.
