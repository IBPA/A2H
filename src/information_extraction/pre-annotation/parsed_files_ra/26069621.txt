OBJECTIVE: Apoptosis of chondrocytes in articular cartilage has been observed in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, molecules involved in such chondrocyte 
apoptosis in arthritic joints have not been fully understood. We previously 
observed that apoptosis of chondrocytes is enhanced in a murine arthritis model 
induced by injection with anti-type II collagen antibodies and 
lipopolysaccharide (mAbs/LPS), and osteopontin (OPN) deficiency suppresses 
chondrocyte apoptosis in this arthritis model in vivo. To understand how OPN 
deficiency renders resistance against chondrocyte apoptosis, we examined the 
cellular basis for this protection.
DESIGN: Chondrocytes were prepared from wild-type and OPN-deficient mouse ribs, 
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced cell death was examined based on 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: TNF-α treatment induced LDH release in wild-type chondrocytes, while 
OPN deficiency suppressed such LDH release in the cultures of these cells. 
TNF-α-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells was observed in 
wild-type chondrocytes, while OPN deficiency in chondrocytes suppressed the 
TNF-α induction of TUNEL-positive cells. OPN deficiency suppressed TNF-α-induced 
increase in caspase-3 activity in chondrocytes in culture. Furthermore, OPN 
overexpression in chondrocytes enhanced TNF-α-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the presence of OPN in chondrocytes is 
involved in the susceptibility of these cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis.
