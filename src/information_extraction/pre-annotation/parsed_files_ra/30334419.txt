This study aims to explore the possible mechanism of treatment of 
collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by tolerogenic dendritic cells 
(tDCs). Different methods were used to induce and cultivate tDCs, and suitable 
conditions for tDC cultivation were explored. The experimental RA induced by 
collagen in mouse was treated by the obtained tDCs, and the possible mechanism 
was explored. The serum concentration of TNF-α, IFN-β, IL-4 and anti-type II 
collagen antibody were detected by ELISA. The anti-type II collagen antibody of 
mice without treatment was higher than that without disease onset, while the 
Blank-DC group, VIP-DC group and Bay-D had no statistically significant 
differences (P>0.05). Compared to the group without disease onset, the TNF-α 
level of those without treatment was significantly higher, while INF-γ, IL-1β 
and IL-4 concentration showed no significant difference (P>0.05). Compared to 
the untreated group, the TNF-α and IL-1β concentration after VIP-DC treatment 
were significantly decreased, while IL-4 was increased (P less than0.05). In 
summary, VIP-DC and Bay-DC alleviate joint inflammation, synovitis and bone 
erosion by reducing the production of anti-type II collagen antibody, inhibiting 
proinflammatory factors and increasing inflammation inhibitors.
