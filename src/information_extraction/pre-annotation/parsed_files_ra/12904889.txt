Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects multiple 
peripheral joints. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is 
characterized by synovial hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, cartilage 
destruction, and bone erosion. To gain insight into the etiology of the disease, 
a variety of animal models have been established. Twelve years ago George 
Kollias' laboratory generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse that over-expresses human 
TNF-alpha, and develops an erosive polyarthritis with many characteristics 
observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The phenotype of this mouse model 
validated the theory that TNF-alpha is at the apex of the pro-inflammatory 
cascade in rheumatoid arthritis, and foreshadowed the remarkable success of 
anti-TNF-alpha therapy that has transformed the effective management of this 
disease. As such, the TNF-Tg mice are very useful tools for dissecting the 
molecular mechanisms of the pathogenic process and evaluating the efficacy of 
novel therapeutic strategies for rheumatoid arthritis. In this review we (1) 
provide a brief summary of TNF-alpha biology and the role of this dominant 
cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis, (2) describe the various TNF-Tg models and 
their phenotypes, and (3) give examples of how this model has been used 
experimentally.
