Crude saponin extracts of five medicinal plants used in the treatment of 
inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, gout and haemorrhoids were 
screened for anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema 
test. These plants were the whole plant of Schwenkia americana Linn (WSA), the 
rhizomes of Asparagus africanus Lam (RAA), the leaves of Dichrostachys cinerea 
Linn (LDC), the stem bark of Ficus iteophylla Miq (BFI) and the leaves of 
Indigofera pulchra Willd (LIP). A modify traditional method of crude saponins 
extraction was used to give the following percentage yields: WSA-2.74%, 
RAA-3.59%, LDC-1.62%, BFI-0.81% and LIP-1.57% respectively. Thin-layer 
chromatography was used to identify the type of saponins present in the 
extracts. The acute toxicity study of the crude saponin extracts in mice gave 
the following intraperitoneal LD50: WSA-471.2mg/kg, RAA- 1264.9mg/kg, LDC-1264.9 
mg/kg, BFI-118.3mg/kg and LIP-1264.9 mg/kg respectively. The anti-inflammatory 
study of the extracts showed statistically significant (P<0.05) decreases in the 
rat paw-oedema as compared to the control. The percentage inhibitions of the 
extracts after four hours were as follow: WSA-61%, RAA-55%, LDC-72%, BFI-66% and 
LIP-40% respectively. These values were found to be comparable to that of 
ketoprofen-63%. The study showed that the anti-inflammatory properties 
attributable to these plants may be due to their saponins contents.
