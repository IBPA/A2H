Inappropriate activation of complement contributes to pathology in diverse 
inflammatory diseases. Soluble recombinant forms of the natural cell membrane 
regulators of complement are effective in animal models and some human diseases. 
However, their use is limited for reasons related to cost, short half lives, and 
propensity to cause unwanted systemic effects. Some of these limitations may be 
overcome by use of bacterial expression systems, specific targeting moieties, 
and judicious choice of regulator. Here we describe the application of these 
strategies to the generation of a membrane-targeted form of CD59. A recombinant 
soluble form of rat CD59, comprising the first 71 residues of the mature protein 
and missing the membrane-anchoring signal, was expressed in bacteria, purified, 
and refolded in a fully active form. The protein was coupled through its 
carboxyl terminus to a short, synthetic address tag that confers membrane 
binding activity. Attachment of the membrane address tag markedly increased 
complement-inhibitory activity assessed in vitro in hemolysis assays. 
Intra-articular administration of the tagged agent markedly suppressed disease 
in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in Lewis rats. This novel type of agent, 
termed sCD59-APT542, offers for the first time the prospect of efficient and 
specific inhibition of membrane attack complex activity in vivo.
