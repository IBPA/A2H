p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated primarily in 
response to inflammatory cytokines and cellular stress, and inhibitors which 
target the p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs have shown potential for the treatment of 
inflammatory disease. Here we report the generation and initial characterization 
of a knockout of the p38beta (MAPK11) gene. p38beta-/- mice were viable and 
exhibited no apparent health problems. The expression and activation of 
p38alpha, ERK1/2, and JNK in response to cellular stress was normal in embryonic 
fibroblasts from p38beta-/- mice, as was the activation of p38-activated kinases 
MAPKAP-K2 and MSK1. The transcription of p38-dependent immediate-early genes was 
also not affected by the knockout of p38beta, suggesting that p38alpha is the 
predominant isoform involved in these processes. The p38beta-/- mice also showed 
normal T-cell development. Lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production was 
also normal in the p38beta-/- mice. As p38 is activated by tumor necrosis 
factor, the p38beta-/- mice were crossed onto a TNFDeltaARE mouse line. These 
mice overexpress tumor necrosis factor, which results in development symptoms 
similar to rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The progression 
of these diseases was not however moderated by knockout of p38beta. Together 
these results suggest that p38alpha, and not p38beta, is the major p38 isoform 
involved in the immune response and that it would not be necessary to retain 
activity against p38beta during the development of p38 inhibitors.
