OBJECTIVE: Anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies (Mab) are considered to be a potential 
therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, Fas mediated liver and 
chondrocyte damage is a serious problem in its clinical application. m-HFE7A, a 
novel anti-Fas Mab, selectively induces apoptosis in inflammatory cells. We 
succeeded in humanizing m-HFE7A to obtain h-HFE7A. We investigated the 
therapeutic effects of h-HFE7A Mab in RA.
METHODS: We investigated the apoptosis-inducing activities of h-HFE7A on human 
Fas ligand transfected cells and cultured human activated lymphocytes (human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and isolated human RA synovial lymphocytes), 
synoviocytes, and chondrocytes. We then examined the effects of h-HFE7A Mab in 
vivo using SCID-HuRAg mice implanted with human RA tissue.
RESULTS: Administration of h-HFE7A Mab alone did not induce apoptosis in 
cultured human Fas ligand transfected cells and activated lymphocytes. However, 
apoptosis-inducing activities were noted by this Mab crosslinking with a 
secondary antibody or Fcgamma receptor positive cells. In contrast, no apoptosis 
induction by h-HFE7A was observed on cultured synoviocytes and chondrocytes with 
or without crosslinking. Thus the crosslinking with Fcgamma receptor positive 
cells is essential for the efficacy of this Mab in vivo. In the implanted tissue 
of the SCID-HuRAg mice, the number of inflammatory cells was significantly 
decreased in the h-HFE7A Mab treated group compared to the IgG treated control 
group. Moreover, there were only negligible effects in synoviocytes and 
chondrocytes with the h-HFE7A Mab.
CONCLUSION: Administration of this novel humanized anti-Fas Mab may provide a 
new treatment for RA by inducing Fas mediated apoptosis in inflammatory cells.
