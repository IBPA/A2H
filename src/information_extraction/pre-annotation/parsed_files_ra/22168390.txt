A significant decrease in tissue pH or acidosis is a common feature of numerous 
diseases, including RA (rheumatoid arthritis). Cartilage homoeostasis is 
profoundly affected by local acidosis in the joints. The diuretic, amiloride, is 
neuroprotective in models of cerebral ischaemia, a property attributable to the 
inhibition of ASICs (acid-sensing ion channels) by the drug. However, little is 
known about the effect of amiloride on apoptosis induced by extracellular acid 
in articular chondrocytes. We have found that amiloride could restrain the 
acid-induced apoptosis of rat articular chondrocytes in vitro. Primary rat 
articular chondrocytes were isolated, cultured and induced to apoptose by 
exposure to extracellular solution (pH 6.0), while simultaneously treated with 
50-200 Î¼M amiloride. Apoptotic rate, mitochondrial function, levels of 
apoptosis-related gene Bcl-2 family mRNA and activity of caspase 3/9 in 
chondrocytes were examined. Amiloride inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis in a 
dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, amiloride partly restored the levels of 
mitochondrial membrane potential by regulation of Bcl-2 family gene mRNA 
expression, and activity of caspase 3/9 in chondrocytes induced by extracellular 
acid. Our results indicated that amiloride protected against acid-induced 
apoptosis in rat articular chondrocytes by increasing anti-apoptotic ability and 
down-regulation of pro-apoptotic factors, thus protecting mitochondrial 
function.
