The Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases is associated with various 
cytokine receptors. JAK1 and JAK3 play particularly important roles in the 
immune response, and their inhibition is expected to provide targeted immune 
modulation. Several oral JAK inhibitors have recently been developed for 
treating autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we 
investigated the pharmacological effects of peficitinib (formerly known as 
ASP015K), a novel, chemically synthesized JAK inhibitor. We found that 
peficitinib inhibited JAK1 and JAK3 with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 3.9 
and 0.7 nM, respectively. Peficitinib also inhibited IL-2-dependent T cell 
proliferation in vitro and STAT5 phosphorylation in vitro and ex vivo. 
Furthermore, peficitinib dose-dependently suppressed bone destruction and paw 
swelling in an adjuvant-induced arthritis model in rats via prophylactic or 
therapeutic oral dosing regimens. Peficitinib also showed efficacy in the model 
by continuous intraperitoneal infusion. Area under the concentration versus time 
curve (AUC) at 50% inhibition of paw swelling via intraperitoneal infusion was 
similar to exposure levels of AUC at 50% inhibition via oral administration, 
implying that AUC might be important for determining the therapeutic efficacy of 
peficitinib. These data suggest that peficitinib has therapeutic potential for 
the oral treatment of RA.
