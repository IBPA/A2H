IL-4 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties on activated macrophages. 
Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease, is characterized by a 
paucity of IL-4 and an abundance of synovial macrophage-derived mediators. 
Herein, the effect of a single injection of adenovirus-producing rat IL-4 
(AxCAIL-4) or a control virus with no inserted gene was compared with the effect 
of PBS injection into rat ankles. Ankles were injected before arthritis onset or 
at maximal inflammation. Preventatively, AxCAIL-4 reduced adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AIA)- and/or AIA/adenoviral-induced ankle inflammation, decreasing 
articular index scores, ankle circumferences, paw volumes, radiographic scores, 
mean levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, the number of inflammatory 
cells, and the number of synovial blood vessels. Therapeutically, AxCAIL-4 also 
decreased ankle circumferences and paw volumes in comparison with a control 
virus with no inserted gene and PBS groups. After arthritis onset, mean levels 
of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and RANTES were 
decreased in AxCAIL-4 rat ankle homogenates compared with PBS-treated 
homogenates. Thus, increased expression of IL-4 via gene therapy administered in 
a preventative and/or therapeutic manner reduced joint inflammation, synovial 
cellularity, levels of proinflammatory cytokines, vascularization, and bony 
destruction in rat AIA, suggesting that a similar treatment in humans may be 
beneficial.
