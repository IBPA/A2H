Nanoparticle-based therapeutics are emerging technologies that have the 
potential to greatly impact the treatment of many human diseases. However, drug 
instability and premature release from the nanoparticles during circulation 
currently preclude clinical translation. Herein, we use a lipase-labile (Sn 2) 
fumagillin prodrug platform coupled with a unique lipid surface-to-surface 
targeted delivery mechanism, termed contact-facilitated drug delivery, to 
counter the premature drug release and overcome the inherent photo-instability 
of fumagillin, an established anti-angiogenic agent. We show that 
α(v)β(3)-integrin targeted fumagillin prodrug nanoparticles, administered at 0.3 
mg of fumagillin prodrug/kg of body weight suppress the clinical disease indices 
of KRN serum-mediated arthritis in a dose-dependent manner when compared to 
treatment with the control nanoparticles with no drug. This study demonstrates 
the effectiveness of this lipase-labile prodrug nanocarrier in a relevant 
preclinical model that approximates human rheumatoid arthritis. The 
lipase-labile prodrug paradigm offers a translatable approach that is broadly 
applicable to many targeted nanosystems and increases the translational 
potential of this platform for many diseases.
