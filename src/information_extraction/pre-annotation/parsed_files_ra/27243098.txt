To obtain an additional pharmacological agent for the diagnosis of inflammation, 
we investigated the medical use of (89)Zr-oxalate as a positron emission 
tomography (PET) probe for the in vivo imaging of inflammation and compared its 
efficacy to that of 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and sodium 
[(18)F]fluoride. (89)Zr-oxalate exhibited observable higher uptake in a 
macrophage cell line than in tumor cells. The inflammatory lesions and tumors 
were clearly visualized by PET imaging and autoradiography using (89)Zr-oxalate. 
Compared to [(18)F]FDG and sodium [(18)F]fluoride, (89)Zr-oxalate demonstrated a 
high selectivity index to the tumor at an early time point after injection and 
to inflammation at a delayed time point after injection (24 h). Through 
histological examination, large numbers of macrophages and neutrophils were 
observed in the tumor lesions with the highest (89)Zr-oxalate uptake. In a 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse model, (89)Zr-oxalate demonstrated a high level 
of accumulation in inflammatory lesions. (89)Zr-oxalate is a new strategic tool 
for tumor imaging and inflammatory processes.
