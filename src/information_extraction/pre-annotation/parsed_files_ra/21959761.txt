Injection of adjuvant (Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in mineral oil) into 
rats produces an immune reaction that characteristically involves inflammatory 
destruction of cartilage and bone of the distal joints with concomitant swelling 
of surrounding tissues. Adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats is commonly used to 
evaluate compounds that might be of potential use as drugs for treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory conditions. This unit 
describes a method for inducing arthritis by injecting adjuvant into the tail 
and evaluating a test compound for the ability to inhibit the inflammatory 
response.
