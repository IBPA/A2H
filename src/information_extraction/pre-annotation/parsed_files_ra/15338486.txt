OBJECTIVE: To test whether methotrexate (MTX) therapy of rat adjuvant arthritis 
(AA) prevents loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and loss of adipose and lean 
body mass compared to pair-fed controls with untreated rat AA (positive 
controls) and rats without AA (negative controls).
METHODS: AA was induced by a Mycobacterium butyricum injection at the base of 
the tail of 5-week-old female Lewis rats. The MTX-treated group was injected 
with adjuvant and then treated twice weekly with MTX (1.0 mg/kg/wk 
intraperitoneally). To control for the effects of AA on appetite and weight, 
food given to control animals and MTX-treated rats with AA was limited to that 
consumed by rats with untreated AA. At 42 days post-adjuvant injection, the 
animals were sacrificed and tibial BMD was measured. Body composition was 
analyzed for percentage fat, protein, ash, and water.
RESULTS: There was no difference in ankle edema score or ankle width between the 
negative controls and MTX-treated group at necropsy. BMD was significantly 
higher in the negative controls versus positive controls and MTX-treated and in 
MTX-treated versus positive controls. There was significantly less body fat and 
protein and greater body water in the positive controls and MTX group compared 
to the negative controls.
CONCLUSION: MTX prevents loss of BMD in the tibia in the rat AA model compared 
to positive controls. While MTX is effective in lowering inflammation in rat AA, 
there are still significant losses in BMD and body composition, which may have 
implications for rheumatoid arthritis.
