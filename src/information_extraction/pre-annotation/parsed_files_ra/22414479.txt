ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) is a 
wild medicinal herb of Central American origin that is now globally widespread. 
Its traditional uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and premenopausal 
pain both of which have an inflammatory component. The present study 
demonstrates the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of three Oenothera biennis 
compounds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oenotheralanosterol A and B (Oen-A & Oen-B) along with 
gallic acid (GA) were isolated and characterized using column chromatography and 
NMR. The compounds were tested with LPS stimulated peritoneal mouse macrophages 
assaying for suppression of IL-6, TNF-α and NO synthesis. An HILIC method for 
the simultaneous quantitation of GA, Oen-A, and Oen-B in Oenothera biennis plant 
material was also developed as a means of monitoring quality of plant material.
RESULTS: Significant inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 by GA, Oen-A and Oen-B was 
observed (p<0.05). Inhibition was concentration dependent and no synergistic or 
antagonistic effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines was found when used in 
combination (1:1) (p>0.05). The HILIC analysis method was validated using 
Oenothera biennis root.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the anti-inflammatory activity of Oenothera 
biennis root compounds and supports its traditional use in arthritis management. 
Active anti-inflammatory compounds were identified and quantified by the HILIC 
method.
