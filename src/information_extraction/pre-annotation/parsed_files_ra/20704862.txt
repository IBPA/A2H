Extract: Autoreactive T cells are part of the normal immune system and are kept 
under control by mechanisms known as anergy. Autoimmune diseases are caused by 
the breakdown of this tolerance, and T cell activation leads to severe 
inflammation and tissue damage. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, synovial 
joints will be destroyed whereas in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, 
type 1 diabetes), insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets of 
Langerhans will be the focus of the attack. The genetic makeup of susceptible 
individuals and the environmental factors leading to autoimmunity are complex 
and largely unknown. In many instances, the main genetic locus that has been 
determined is the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II locus. In the 
case of IDDM this locus encodes alleles such as HLA-DR4, -DR3, and -DQ8 in 
humans and I-Ag7 in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. Since MHC class II 
molecules present peptides to CD4 positive T cells, it is tempting to link genes 
and function and to study closely CD4+ T cells in the context of autoimmunity. 
It is now well established that, indeed, these cells are essential for the 
initiation and development of autoimmunity, however, in-depth investigation of 
them has been impeded by two major roadblocks. First, potential antigens, and 
therefore relevant peptides, are scarce and difficult to isolate. Secondly, 
reagents able to detect T cells in an antigen-specific fashion have remained 
elusive.
