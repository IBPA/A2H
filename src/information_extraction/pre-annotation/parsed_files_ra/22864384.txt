Despite the clinical success of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies in 
the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn 
disease and psoriasis, full control of the diseases only occurs in a subset of 
patients and there is a need for new therapeutics with improved efficacy against 
broader patient populations. One possible approach is to combine biological 
therapeutics, but both the cost of the therapeutics and the potential for 
additional toxicities needs to be considered. In addition to the various 
mediators of immune and inflammatory pathways, angiogenesis is reported to 
contribute substantially to the overall pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. 
The combination of an anti-angiogenic agent with anti-TNF into one molecule 
could be more efficacious without the risk of severe immunosuppression. To 
evaluate this approach with our Zybody technology, we generated bispecific 
antibodies that contain an Ang2 targeting peptide genetically fused to the 
anti-TNF antibody adalimumab (HumiraÂ®). The bispecific molecules retain the 
binding and functional characteristics of the anti-TNF antibody, but with 
additional activity that neutralizes Ang2. In a TNF transgenic mouse model of 
arthritis, the bispecific anti-TNF-Ang2 molecules showed a dose-dependent 
reduction in both clinical symptoms and histological scores that were 
significantly better than that achieved by adalimumab alone.
