Mycoplasma arthritidis causes arthritis in rodents that resembles human 
rheumatoid arthritis. It produces a superantigen (MAM) that stimulates 
production of cytokines by making a bridge between lymphocyte T-cell receptor 
with the appropriate Vbeta chain, and H-2 1-Ealpha MHC class II molecules. Here 
we studied MAM-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse peritoneal 
macrophages and found that it was: (1) time and concentration dependent, (2) 
possibly derived from inducible NOS synthase since it was reduced significantly 
by amino guanidine pretreatment, (3) restricted to H-2(K) (C3H/HePas and 
C3H/HeJ) and H-2(d) strains (BALB/c), (4) independent of TLR4 signaling since 
the coisogenic strains C3H/HePas and C3H/HeJ (TLR4 deficient) produced similar 
levels of NO following MAM stimulation, (5) potentiated by lipopolysaccharide, 
and (6) dependent on the presence of nonadherent peritoneal cells. 
Neutralization of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma in the peritoneal cell cultures 
with monoclonal antibodies abolished MAM-induced NO production. Addition of 
rIFNgamma to the adherent cells substituted the nonadherent cells for 
MAM-induced NO production. A macrophage cell line, J774A.1 (H-2(d)), also 
produced NO upon MAM stimulation but only when BALB/c spleen lymphocytes were 
added. Thus, in murine macrophages, MAM induces NO production that is dependent 
on signaling through MHC class II molecules and IFNgamma but independent of TLR4 
expression.
