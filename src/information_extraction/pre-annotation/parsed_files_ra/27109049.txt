Curcumin and emu oil derived from emu bird (Dromaius novaehollandiae) has shown 
promising results against inflammation. However, the delivery of curcumin is 
hindered due to low solubility and poor permeation. In addition, till date the 
role of emu oil in drug delivery has not been explored systemically. Hence, the 
current investigation was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential 
of curcumin in combination with emu oil from a nanoemulgel formulation in 
experimental inflammation and arthritic in vivo models. Nanoemulsion was 
prepared using emu oil, Cremophor RH 40 and Labrafil M2125CS as oil phase, 
surfactant and co-surfactant. The optimized curcumin loaded nanoemulsion with 
emu oil was incorporated into carbopol gel for convenient application by topical 
route. The anti-inflammatory efficacy was evaluated in carrageenan induced paw 
edema and FCA induced arthritic rat model in terms of paw swelling, weight 
indices of the liver and spleen, pathological changes in nuclear factor kappa B, 
iNOS, COX-2 expression and inflammatory cytokines. Arthritic scoring, paw 
volume, biochemical, molecular, radiological and histological examinations 
indicated significant improvement in anti-inflammatory activity with 
formulations containing curcumin in combination with emu oil compared to pure 
curcumin. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of formulations 
containing curcumin and emu oil combination in rheumatoid arthritis.
