Invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) is critical in the pathogenesis 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The metalloproteinases (MMPs) and activator of 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway play a critical 
role in RA-FLS invasion induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The present study 
aimed to explore the anti-invasive activity of celastrol on LPS-stimulated human 
RA-FLSs, and to elucidate the mechanism involved. We investigated the effect of 
celastrol on LPS-induced FLS migration and invasion as well as MMP expression 
and explored the upstream signal transduction. Results showed that celastrol 
suppressed LPS-stimulated FLS migration and invasion by inhibiting MMP-9 
expression and activity. Furthermore, our results revealed that celastrol 
inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by suppressing the binding 
activity of NF-κB in the MMP-9 promoter, and suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB 
pathway. Administration of celastrol (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 
daily for 3 weeks in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model markedly alleviated 
the clinical signs, synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration of 
joints. In conclusion, celastrol might inhibit FLS migration and invasion 
induced by LPS by suppressing TLR4/NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 expression, providing a 
theoretical foundation for the clinical treatment of RA with celastrol.
