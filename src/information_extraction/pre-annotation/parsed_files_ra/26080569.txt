To observe the serum samples and the anti-inflammatory effect of Tripterygium 
wilfordii in treating RA by using the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, 
make a correlation analysis on concentration-time and effect-time curves, and 
explore RORγt, IL-17, STAT3, IL-6 mRNA transcriptional levels in rats by PCR. 
Methotrexate, tripterine and high-dose T. wilfordii could down-regulate RORγt, 
IL-17, STAT3, IL-6 mRNA transcriptional levels in AA rat lymph nodes. The study 
on PK-PD model showed correlations between inflammatory factors and blood 
concentration of T. wilfordii. T. wilfordii and its main active constituent 
tripterine could show the inflammatory effect and treat RA by inhibiting IL-17 
cytokine.
