BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of adoptive infusion of specific 
thymus-derived invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in a mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was observed, and the mechanism of cellular 
immunotherapy was preliminarily explored.
METHODS: Thymus-derived iNKT cells were infused to RA model mice, with α-GalCer 
as a positive control. Then, ankle swelling was examined, as well as 
inflammatory cell infiltration to the joint tissue (hematoxylin-eosin [H&E] 
staining). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assess iNKT cell and helper T 
lymphocyte (Th) subsets. Serum cytokine levels were determined with cytometric 
bead array (CBA), with protein expression levels of related transcription 
factors assessed by Western blot.
RESULTS: The joint swelling in RA model animals were significantly improved in 
the cell therapy and α-GalCer positive control groups (P < 0.05). In addition, 
iNKT frequencies in peripheral blood, the thymus and spleen were increased 
significantly (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, iNKT1 subset frequencies in the thymus and 
spleen were decreased, as well as splenic Th1 and Th17 cell subset rates, and 
serum TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 levels. The rates of iNKT2 and Th2 subsets as well 
as IL-4 and IL-10 levels were increased (P < 0.05). Thymus GATA-3 and splenic 
PLZF protein levels were increased (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Adoptive infusion of thymus-derived iNKT cells exerts therapeutic 
effects in RA mice by increasing iNKT frequency, altering the proportions of 
iNKT cell subsets, correcting Th cell subset imbalance and reducing the amounts 
of inflammatory cytokines.
