Salvia plebeia R. Br. has been used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases 
and as an antioxidant in many countries, including Korea and China. In this 
study, we investigated the effects of S. plebeia extract (SPE) on inflammatory 
arthritis and the underlying mechanisms of action. We used a collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model. TNF-α-stimulated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial 
fibroblasts were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action. Oral 
administration of SPE improved the clinical arthritis score, footpad thickness, 
and histologic changes, as well as serum IgG1 and IgG2a levels. SPE 
administration inhibited Th1/Th2/Th17 phenotype CD4(+) T lymphocyte expansion in 
inguinal lymph node and expression of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, 
MMP-1, and MMP-3 in the ankle joint tissue. SPE significantly suppressed the 
expression of cytokines and MMP-1 by down-regulating NF-κB, Akt, and 
mitogen-activated protein kinases in RA synovial fibroblasts. Taken together, 
these results indicate that SPE is therapeutically efficacious against chronic 
inflammatory arthritis, suggesting that SPE is a candidate for treating RA.
