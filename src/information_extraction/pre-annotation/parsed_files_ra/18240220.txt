Serum antibodies reactive with the keratin layer of rat esophagus (AKA) were 
found in 46 of 80 (57.5%) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In contrast, AKA 
were present in only 7 of 82 (9.5%) patients with other types of rheumatic 
disorders and in 2 of 47 (4.2%) healthy subjects. AKA were not specific for RA, 
however, because in the former group, AKA were present in 4 of 20 (20%) systemic 
sclerosis patients and in 3 of 12 (25%) ankylosing spondylitis patients. AKA 
belong predominantly to the IgG class and are complement fixing. Although found 
in some RA joint fluids, AKA were not selectively concentrated in the joint 
fluid. Absorption of RA serum with type I human collagen or with human epidermal 
keratin did not remove AKA activity. The frequency of AKA in RA patients both 
negative and positive for DR4 was equal. There was no relationship between the 
frequency of AKA and the occurrence of other serum autoantibodies such as 
antibodies to intermediate filaments, smooth muscle, and nuclear antigens. Serum 
antibody reactive with human stratum corneum found in patients with psoriatic 
arthritis was shown to be different from AKA. Rabbit antiserum to human keratin 
did not inhibit the reaction of AKA against the keratin layer of rat esophagus. 
Autoimmunity to structural proteins including collagen, vimentin intermediate 
filaments, smooth muscle antigens, and keratin is a characteristic feature of 
RA.
