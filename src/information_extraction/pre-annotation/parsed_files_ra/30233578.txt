The K/BxN mouse is a spontaneous model of arthritis driven by T cell receptor 
transgenic CD4+ T cells from the KRN strain that are activated by 
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) peptides presented by the H-2g7 allele from 
the NOD strain. It is a model of autoimmune seropositive arthritis because the 
production of anti-GPI IgG is necessary and sufficient for joint pathology. The 
production of high levels of anti-GPI IgG requires on the expansion of CD4+ 
follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. The metabolic requirements of this expansion 
have never been characterized. Based on the therapeutic effects of the 
combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) in lupus models that 
normalized the expansion of effector CD4+ T cells. We showed that the CD4+ T 
cells and to a lesser extent, the B cells from K/BxN mice are more metabolically 
active than the KRN controls. Accordingly, preventive inhibition of glycolysis 
with 2DG significantly reduced joint inflammation and the activation of both 
adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as the production of pathogenic 
autoantibodies. However, contrary to the lupus-prone mice, the addition of 
metformin had little beneficial effect, suggesting that glycolysis is the major 
driver of immune activation in this model. We propose that K/BxN mice are 
another model in which autoreactive Tfh cells are highly glycolytic and that 
their function can be limited by inhibiting glucose metabolism.
