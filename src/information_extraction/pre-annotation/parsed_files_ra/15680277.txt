Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) has been implicated in joint destruction of 
chronic arthritis diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. FR217840 
(2R)-1-([5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-thienyl]sulfonyl)-N-hydroxy-4-(methylsulfonyl)-2-piperazinecarboxamide 
is a potent, orally active synthetic MMP inhibitor that inhibits human 
collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8 and MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and 
membrane type MMP (MT-MMP) (MT1-MMP/MMP-14). FR217840 also inhibits rat 
collagenase and gelatinase. We studied the effect of FR217840 on a rat adjuvant 
induced arthritis model. Although oral administration (days 1-21) of FR217840 
(3.2, 10, 32 mg/kg) to adjuvant injected Lewis rats did not affect inflammation, 
as indicated by both hind paw swelling and histological inflammatory 
infiltration, FR217840 suppressed both bone destruction and serum pyridinoline 
content in a dose-dependent manner. Also, FR217840 (32 mg/kg) reduced 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) cell number in the ankle joints of 
rats with arthritis. These results indicate that FR217840 successfully 
suppressed joint destruction and suggest that FR217840 may have potential as a 
novel anti-rheumatic drug.
