Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are of myeloid origin and are able to 
suppress T cell responses. The role of MDSCs in autoimmune diseases remains 
controversial, and little is known about the function of MDSCs in autoimmune 
arthritis. In this study, we clarify that MDSCs play crucial roles in the 
regulation of proinflammatory immune response in a collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) mouse model. MDSCs accumulated in the spleens of mice with CIA when 
arthritis severity peaked. These MDSCs inhibited the proliferation of CD4(+) T 
cells and their differentiation into Th17 cells in vitro. Moreover, MDSCs 
inhibited the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-6 by CD4(+) T cells in 
vitro, whereas they promoted the production of IL-10. Adoptive transfer of MDSCs 
reduced the severity of CIA in vivo, which was accompanied by a decrease in the 
number of CD4(+) T cells and Th17 cells in the draining lymph nodes. However, 
depletion of MDSCs abrogated the spontaneous improvement of CIA. In conclusion, 
MDSCs in CIA suppress the progression of CIA by inhibiting the proinflammatory 
immune response of CD4(+) T cells. These observations suggest that MDSCs play 
crucial roles in the regulation of autoimmune arthritis, which could be 
exploited in new cell-based therapies for human rheumatoid arthritis.
