In this study, we investigated the effect of the aqueous extract of Mosla 
dianthera (Maxim.) (AEMD) on the mast cell-mediated allergy model and studied 
the possible mechanism of action. Mast cell-mediated allergic disease is 
involved in many diseases such as asthma, sinusitis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
The discovery of drugs for the treatment of allergic disease is an important 
subject in human health. AEMD inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic 
reactions in mice. AEMD decreased immunoglobulin E-mediated local allergic 
reactions, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. AEMD attenuated intracellular calcium 
level and release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells activated by 
compound 48/80. Furthermore, AEMD attenuated the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA) and calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 secretion 
in human mast cells. The inhibitory effect of AEMD on the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines was nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) dependent. AEMD decreased PMA 
and A23187-induced degradation of IkappaBalpha and nuclear translocation of 
NF-kappaB. Our findings provide evidence that AEMD inhibits mast cell-derived 
immediate-type allergic reactions and involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and NF-kappaB in these effects.
