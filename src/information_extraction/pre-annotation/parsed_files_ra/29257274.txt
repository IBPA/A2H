The nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 domain (NLRP3) 
inflammasome/interleukin (IL)-1β axis serves an essential role in regulating the 
development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The dysregulation of cellular 
metabolism, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, results in the activation of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome. microRNA (miR)‑33 has previously been identified to be a 
regulator of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. However, whether 
miR‑33 regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome/IL‑1β axis remains unknown. In the 
present study, it was observed that an miR‑33 mimic or anti‑miR‑33 markedly 
stimulated or inhibited, respectively, IL‑1β protein expression levels in mouse 
peritoneal macrophages. Mechanistically, miR‑33 upregulated the expression of 
NLRP3 mRNA and protein as well as caspase‑1 activity in primary macrophages. In 
addition, the results demonstrated that miR‑33 impaired mitochondrial oxygen 
consumption rates, resulting in the accumulation of cellular reactive oxygen 
species, which stimulated NLRP3 expression, caspase‑1 activity and IL‑1β 
secretion. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑33 levels and 
NLRP3 inflammasome activity were increased in peripheral blood monocytes from 
patients with RA patients compared with healthy donors. In conclusion, the 
present study identified miR‑33 to be a positive regulator of the NLRP3 
inflammasome in macrophages. The miR‑33/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway may therefore 
be involved in RA development.
