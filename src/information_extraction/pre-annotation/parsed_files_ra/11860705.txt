Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease 
characterized by synovial pannus formation, leukocyte infiltration, and 
angiogenesis. Adenoviral production of interleukin-13 (IL-13) reduces levels of 
proinflammatory mediators in an explant model of RA synovial tissue in vitro. To 
assess this approach in an animal model of arthritis, we compared 
intra-articular injections of an adenovirus producing rat IL-13 (AxCArIL-13), a 
control virus, and rat ankles receiving phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). We demonstrate that IL-13 levels are normally 
low in ankles throughout the course of rat AIA. We show that administration of 
AxCArIL-13 before arthritis onset significantly reduces ankle circumference, paw 
volume, bony destruction, the number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), the 
quantity of blood vessels, and levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 
(MCP)-1 in ankles. When administered as a treatment to inflamed ankles, 
AxCArIL-13 decreases articular index scores, paw volumes, bony destruction, 
vascularization, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, and the 
quantity of monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. Thus, increasing IL-13 levels 
significantly ameliorates the course of rat AIA, suggesting that similar 
strategies for the treatment of human RA are worthy of further study.
