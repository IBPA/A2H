We report a case of Streptobacillus moniliformis polyarthritis mimicking a 
rheumatoid arthritis, in a pet shop employee. In culture of fluid joint growth a 
curious Gram-negative bacillus was identified by polymerase chain reaction as 
Streptobacillus moniliformis. The outcome was good after surgical debridment and 
rifampin-clindamycin combination during 4 weeks.
