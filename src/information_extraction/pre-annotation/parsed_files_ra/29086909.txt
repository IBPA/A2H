The acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), which is activated by extracellular 
acid, contributes to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. However, it 
remains unclear whether ASIC1a mediates acid-induced matrix metabolism in rat 
articular chondrocytes via activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. In the 
current study, we found that extracellular acidification (pH 6.0) inhibited 
proliferation and induced apoptosis of articular chondrocytes in a 
dose-dependent manner, while the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and P38 
MAPK increased, but, this effect was blocked by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and 
the ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1. In addition, extracellular acidification 
increased the expression of c-fos, GAG, HYP, and TIM1/2. These effects were 
inhibited by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, and 
ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1, but not the P38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. 
Finally, extracellular acidification increased the expression of c-jun and 
MMP-2/9, and these effects were blocked by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, P38 MAPK 
inhibitor SB203580, and ASIC1a-specific blocker PcTx-1, but not the ERK1/2 
inhibitor PD98059. In conclusion, ASIC1a inhibits the expression of MMP-2/9, 
GAG, HYP, and TIMP-1/2 by the Ca2+-dependent P38 MAPK/c-jun and ERK/c-fos 
signaling pathways.
