Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality. Inflammation is implicated 
in HF, yet clinical trials targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines in HF were 
unsuccessful, possibly due to redundant functions of individual cytokines. 
Searching for better cardiac inflammation targets, here we link T cells with HF 
development in a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and in human HF 
patients. T cell costimulation blockade, through FDA-approved rheumatoid 
arthritis drug abatacept, leads to highly significant delay in progression and 
decreased severity of cardiac dysfunction in the mouse HF model. The therapeutic 
effect occurs via inhibition of activation and cardiac infiltration of T cells 
and macrophages, leading to reduced cardiomyocyte death. Abatacept treatment 
also induces production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). 
IL-10-deficient mice are refractive to treatment, while protection could be 
rescued by transfer of IL-10-sufficient B cells. These results suggest that T 
cell costimulation blockade might be therapeutically exploited to treat HF.
