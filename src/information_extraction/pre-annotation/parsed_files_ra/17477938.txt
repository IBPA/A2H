R-125224 is a novel humanized anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody prepared from 
HFE7A, which is a monoclonal mouse IgG anti-Fas antibody, by grafting the mouse 
complementarity-determining regions to human IgG, presently being developed as a 
drug for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we 
investigated the tissue distribution of radioactivity in cynomolgus monkeys with 
collagen-induced arthritis at the arm joint (CIA monkeys) after intravenous 
administration of (125)I-labeled R-125224 ((125)I-R-125224). At 168 h after 
administration, we observed a high radioactivity in the bone marrow, thymus, 
lungs, liver, adrenals, spleen, ovaries, axillary lymph node and mesenteric 
lymph node compared to the radioactivity in the plasma. These tissues and organs 
in human are reported to express Fas antigen, strongly suggesting a specific 
binding of (125)I-R-125224 to Fas antigen in cynomolgus monkeys. Semi-micro 
autoradioluminograms of arm joint showed that radioactivity is detected in 
pharmacological site, such as the bone marrow and articular cavity at 168 h. The 
kinetics in binding of R-125224 to activated monkey lymphocytes and hepatocytes 
was also investigated. K(d) values of activated lymphocytes and hepatocytes were 
1.51+/-0.08 and 0.60+/-0.11 nM, respectively, which were similar to those values 
in human lymphocytes and hepatocytes, demonstrating that R-125224 cross-reacts 
with the monkey Fas antigen.
