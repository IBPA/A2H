CIA in the rhesus monkey is an autoimmune-based polyarthritis with inflammation 
and erosion of synovial joints that shares various features with human 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The close phylogenetic relationship between man and 
rhesus monkey makes the model very suitable for preclinical safety and efficacy 
testing of new therapeutics with exclusive reactivity in primates. In this study 
we have investigated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of a humanized 
monoclonal antibody (Daclizumab) against the alpha-chain of the IL-2 receptor 
(CD25). When Daclizumab treatment was started well after immunization but before 
the expected onset of CIA a significant reduction of joint-inflammation and 
joint-erosion was observed. A therapeutic treatment, initiated as soon as the 
first clinical signs of CIA were observed, proved also effective since 
joint-degradation was abrogated. The results of this study indicate that 
Daclizumab has clinical potential for the treatment of RA during periods of 
active inflammation and suppression of the destruction of the joint tissues.
