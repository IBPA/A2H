According to the findings, modified Ganlu Yaoyu San has a good anti-inflammatory 
activity, and can significantly alleviate the degree of arthritis. Its 
therapeutic effect for rheumatoid arthritis may be related to the regulation of 
MAPK pathway of synovial cells. In the study, the rat adjuvant arthritis(AA) 
model was established to further investigate the pharmacodynamic mechanism for 
regulating MAPK pathway of synovial cells. Enzyme-linked immune assay was used 
to determine the serum TNF-α level of AA rats administered with drug for two 
weeks, synovial tissue protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38 content were determined by 
immunohistochemistry, synovial tissue JNK1, ERK1, p38 gene(mRNA) expression were 
detected with fluorescence quantitative PCR(RT-PCR) method. According to the 
results, after administration for two weeks, the levels of serum TNF-α of AA rat 
was significantly decreased(P<0.05). After administration for four weeks, the 
protein expressions of p38 and ERK1/2 in synovial tissue were reduced(P<0.05 or 
P<0.01), the gene expressions of JNK1, p38 and ERK1 in knee joint synovial 
tissue were reduced(P<0.05 or P<0.01). In conclusion, modified Ganlu Yaoyu San 
can effectively treat rheumatoid arthritis. Its mechanism might be related to 
the reduction of TNF-α levels in serum, protein expression of p38 and ERK1/2 in 
synovial tissue, and JNK1, p38 and ERK1 gene expressions, and regulation of MAPK 
pathway.
