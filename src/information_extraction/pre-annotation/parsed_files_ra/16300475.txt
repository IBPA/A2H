CXCR4 is the receptor of the chemokine CXCL12, which is involved in progression 
and metastasis of several types of cancer cells, HIV infection and rheumatoid 
arthritis. The authors developed selective CXCR4 antagonists, T22 and T140, 
initially as anti-HIV agents, which inhibit T cell line-tropic (X4-) HIV-1 
infection through their specific binding to CXCR4. Recently, T140 analogues have 
also been shown to inhibit CXCL12-induced migration of breast cancer cells, 
leukaemia T cells, pancreatic cancer cells, small cell lung cancer cells, 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells 
and so on in vitro. Biostable T140 analogues significantly suppressed pulmonary 
metastasis of breast cancer cells and melanoma cells in mice. Furthermore, these 
compounds significantly suppressed the delayed-type hypersensitivity response 
induced by sheep red blood cells and collagen-induced arthritis, which represent 
in vivo mouse models of arthritis. Thus, T140 analogues proved to be attractive 
lead compounds for chemotherapy of these problematic diseases. This article 
reviews recent research on T140 analogues, referring to several other CXCR4 
antagonists.
