IL-18 is a unique cytokine with prominently wide spectrum biological actions. 
Among these, its IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-inducing activity primarily contributes to 
the development of various inflammatory diseases including inflammatory 
arthritis. IL-18 levels correlate with the disease activity of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). IL-18 is spontaneously released from RA 
synovial cells and OA chondrocytes and seems to participate in the development 
of the inflammatory and destructive alterations of joints via induction of 
TNF-alpha, a potent effector molecule. TNF-alpha, in turn, increases IL-18 
expression in RA synovial cells. Recent clinical trials have revealed the 
efficacy of TNF-alpha in RA with a reduction in circulatory IL-18 levels. These 
may implicate the positive circuit between IL-18 and TNF-alpha for development 
of RA. As IL-18-deficient mice evade collagen-induced arthritis in a mouse RA 
model, therapeutics targeting IL-18 may be beneficial against RA/OA. Here, the 
authors review the possible roles of IL-18 in inflammatory arthritis.
