OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of Hanshibi 
tablet in Kunming mice and the effect of the tablet in ameliorating synovial 
pathology in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Stretching test, capillary permeability and ear swelling test of 
Kunming were performed to observe the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of 
Hanshibi tablet administered intragastrically at different doses. In a SD rat 
model of RA induced by heat-inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculolytic H37Ra 
(Mtb), the effect of the tablet on the symptoms and progression of arthritis was 
observed regularly, and the numbers of the peripheral white blood cells, 
platelets and lymphocytes and mononuclear cells were measured. HE staining was 
used to examine the pathology of the rat ankle, and flow cytometry performed to 
monitor the changes in the T lymphocyte subsets.
RESULTS: Hanshibi tablet treatment reduced the writhing response frequency and 
prolonged the stretching latency of Kunming mice. The tablet also inhibited the 
acetic acid-induced increase in capillary permeability and ear swelling. In the 
rat model of RA, administration of the tablet resulted in reduced ratio of 
CD4(+)/CD8(+), and significantly ameliorated synovial pathology.
CONCLUSION: Hanshibi tablet has obvious analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects 
and ameliorates the synovial pathology in the rat model of RA possibly by 
regulating CD4(+)/CD8(+) balance.
