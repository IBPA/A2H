Immune complex (IC) binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs) is central for 
inflammatory reactions seen in autoimmune diseases. Consequently, a therapeutic 
agent with a possibility to interfere with binding of pathogenic IC to FcgammaRs 
would be valuable in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Here we have explored the therapeutic effect of a recombinant soluble human 
FcgammaRIIb (sFcgammaRIIb) protein in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In vitro 
studies of the sFcgammaRIIb demonstrated binding to mouse IgG, suggesting that 
sFcgammaRIIb can absorb pathogenic IgG anti-collagen type II (CII) IC in vivo. 
Hence, administration of sFcgammaRIIb significantly reduced CIA severity 
compared to control treated mice. The sFcgammaRIIb treated mice had 
significantly less IgG anti-CII antibodies in serum and lower mRNA levels of 
inflammatory cytokines compared to control mice. In conclusion, sFcgammaRIIb 
treatment ameliorates CIA by reducing IC-stimulated inflammation and joint 
swelling. This suggests that recombinant sFcgammaRIIb may be useful as 
therapeutic agent in RA.
