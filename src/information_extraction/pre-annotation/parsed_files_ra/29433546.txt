BACKGROUND: Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a mammalian lectin secreted by endothelial 
cells that is highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissues and 
synovial fluid. Roles have been proposed for galectins in the regulation of 
inflammation and angiogenesis. Therefore, we examined the contribution of Gal-9 
to angiogenesis and inflammation in arthritis.
METHODS: To determine the role of Gal-9 in angiogenesis, we performed human 
dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) chemotaxis, Matrigel tube 
formation, and mouse Matrigel plug angiogenesis assays. We also examined the 
role of signaling molecules in Gal-9-induced angiogenesis by using signaling 
inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). We performed monocyte (MN) 
migration assays in a modified Boyden chamber and assessed the arthritogenicity 
of Gal-9 by injecting Gal-9 into mouse knees.
RESULTS: Gal-9 significantly increased HMVEC migration, which was decreased by 
inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulating kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), p38, Janus 
kinase (Jnk), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Gal-9 HMVEC-induced tube 
formation was reduced by Erk1/2, p38, and Jnk inhibitors, and this was confirmed 
by siRNA knockdown. In mouse Matrigel plug assays, plugs containing Gal-9 
induced significantly higher angiogenesis, which was attenuated by a Jnk 
inhibitor. Gal-9 also induced MN migration, and there was a marked increase in 
MN ingress when C57BL/6 mouse knees were injected with Gal-9 compared with the 
control, pointing to a proinflammatory role for Gal-9.
CONCLUSIONS: Gal-9 mediates angiogenesis, increases MN migration in vitro, and 
induces acute inflammatory arthritis in mice, suggesting a novel role for Gal-9 
in angiogenesis, joint inflammation, and possibly other inflammatory diseases.
