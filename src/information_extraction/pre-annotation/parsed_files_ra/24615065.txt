B-cell depletion can improve disease in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
or multiple sclerosis, indicating the pathogenic contribution of B cells to 
autoimmunity. However, studies in mice have demonstrated that B cells have 
immunosuppressive functions as well, with IL-10 being a critical mediator of 
B-cell-mediated suppression. IL-10-secreting B cells have been shown to promote 
disease remission in some mouse models of autoimmune disorders. Human B cells 
also produce IL-10, and evidence is accumulating that human IL-10-producing B 
cells might inhibit immunity. There is considerable interest in identifying the 
phenotype of B cells providing IL-10 in a suppressive manner, which would 
facilitate the analysis of the molecular mechanisms controlling this B-cell 
property. Here, we review current knowledge on the B-cell subpopulations found 
to provide suppressive functions in mice, considering both the pathological 
context in which they were identified and the signals that control their 
induction. We discuss the phenotype of B cells that have IL-10-dependent 
regulatory activities in mice, which leads us to propose that antibody-secreting 
cells are, in some cases at least, the major source of B-cell-derived regulatory 
IL-10 in vivo. Anti-inflammatory cytokine production by antibody-secreting cells 
offers a novel mechanism for the coordination of innate and humoral immune 
responses.
