An antibody response to defined epitopes located on the triple helical portion 
of type II collagen (CII) is associated with the development of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Monoclonal antibodies to epitopes 
associated with arthritis, but not antibodies specific for epitopes not 
associated with arthritis, induce arthritis in mice, the so-called collagen 
antibody induced arthritis (CAIA) model. We have selected monoclonal IgG 
antibodies specific for four well-defined major epitopes on triple helical CII, 
the C1, J1, D3 and U1 epitopes. These antibodies bind the epitopes specifically 
as determined using recombinant or synthetic triple helical epitopes. They are 
encoded from somatically mutated V genes. They all bind cartilage in vivo in 
normal mice. All of the antibodies induce mild arthritis after injection 
intravenously and if injected as a cocktail they induce severe clinical 
arthritis. Intravenous injection of a total of 4 mg antibodies (0.5 mg 
antibodies per clone) induced arthritis in several different mouse strains 
without any secondary immune stimulus and intraperitoneal injection of LPS 7 
days later dramatically raised the severity. Thus, this method is recommended as 
a new protocol for the induction of CAIA.
