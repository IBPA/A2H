The fruit of Actinidia polygama (AP) has long been used as a folk medicine in 
Korea for the treatment of pain, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation. In the 
present study, bioassay-guided fractionation of AP led to the separation and 
identification of a polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 
which was found to show anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory 
effects of ALA, using acetic acid or carrageenan-induced inflammation models, 
were investi gated in mice or rats, respectively. ALA significantly inhibited 
the acetic acid-induced vascular permeability in a dose dependent manner (34.2 
and 37.7% inhibition at doses of 5 and 10 mg/ kg, respectively). ALA also 
significantly reduced a rat paw edema induced by a single treatment of 
carrageenan. To investigate the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of 
ALA, the effects of ALA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced responses in the 
murine mac rophages cell line, RAW 264.7, were examined. Exposure of 
LPS-stimulated cells to ALA inhibited the accumulation of nitrite and 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the culture medium. Consistent with these 
observations, the protein and mRNA expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 enzyme 
were markedly inhibited by ALA in a dose dependent manner. These results suggest 
that the anti-inflammatory activity of ALA might be due to the suppression of 
the expressions of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA.
