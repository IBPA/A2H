Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a key transcriptional regulator that can 
induce either silencing or activation of target genes. Genetic polymorphisms in 
the MECP2/IRAK1 locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to 
multiple autoimmune diseases such as lupus, primary Sjogren's syndrome, and more 
recently rheumatoid arthritis. Data from our group suggest that the disease risk 
variant in this locus is associated with gain of MeCP2 function. Recent findings 
indicate that MECP2 duplication in human results in defective T helper cell type 
1 (TH1) response and IFN-γ production. Herein, we discuss the data from children 
with MECP2 duplication, human lupus, and from the human MECP2 transgenic and 
Mecp2 deficient mice to support a link between MECP2 overexpression and 
autoimmunity. We also provide findings from an Mecp2 deficient mouse that 
independently support a role for MeCP2 in the immune response and specifically 
in IFN-γ expression.
