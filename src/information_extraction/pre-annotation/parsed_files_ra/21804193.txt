The immune and coagulation systems are both implicated in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Plasma carboxypeptidase B (CPB), which is activated 
by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex, plays a procoagulant role during fibrin 
clot formation. However, an antiinflammatory role for CPB is suggested by the 
recent observation that CPB can cleave proinflammatory mediators, such as C5a, 
bradykinin, and osteopontin. Here, we show that CPB plays a central role in 
downregulating C5a-mediated inflammatory responses in autoimmune arthritis. CPB 
deficiency exacerbated inflammatory arthritis in a mouse model of RA, and 
cleavage of C5a by CPB suppressed the ability of C5a to recruit immune cells in 
vivo. In human patients with RA, genotyping of nonsynonymous SNPs in the 
CPB-encoding gene revealed that the allele encoding a CPB variant with longer 
half-life was associated with a lower risk of developing radiographically severe 
RA. Functionally, this CPB variant was more effective at abrogating the 
proinflammatory properties of C5a. Additionally, expression of both CPB and C5a 
in synovial fluid was higher in patients with RA than in those with 
osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that CPB plays a critical role in 
dampening local, C5a-mediated inflammation and represents a molecular link 
between inflammation and coagulation in autoimmune arthritis.
