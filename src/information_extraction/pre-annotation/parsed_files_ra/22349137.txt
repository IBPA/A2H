OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of ZSTK474, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K) inhibitor, on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA).
METHODS: AIA was induced in Lewis rats by subcutaneous administration of 
Freund's complete adjuvant at the base of the tail on day 0. ZSTK474 was orally 
administered once daily from day 10. The severity of AIA was assessed by 
measuring the hind paw volume. The number of lymphocytes in inguinal lymph nodes 
(ILN) was determined by flow cytometry. The in vitro effects of ZSTK474 on the 
cell proliferation, and the cytokines and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production 
were evaluated by BrdU method, ELISA and cytometric beads array.
RESULTS: ZSTK474 ameliorated the progression of AIA. The temporary increases in 
the number of T cells in ILN, which occurred along with the appearance of 
arthritis, were inhibited in the ZSTK474-treated groups. In vitro studies 
revealed that ZSTK474 inhibited the production of IFNÎ³ and IL-17 in concanavalin 
A-activated T cells. In vitro studies further revealed that ZSTK474 inhibited 
the proliferation and PGE(2) production by fibroblast-like synovial cells (FLS).
CONCLUSION: ZSTK474 demonstrated prophylactic efficacy in a rat model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through inhibition of T cell and FLS functions. It was 
suggested that the inhibitors of PI3K have therapeutic potential for RA.
