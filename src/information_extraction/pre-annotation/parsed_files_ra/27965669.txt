The human complement factor H-related protein-3 (FHR-3) is a soluble regulator 
of the complement system. Homozygous cfhr3/1 deletion is a genetic risk factor 
for the autoimmune form of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), while also 
found to be protective in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The precise 
function of FHR-3 remains to be fully characterized. We generated four mouse 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for FHR-3 (RETC) without cross-reactivity to the 
complement factor H (FH)-family. These antibodies detected FHR-3 from human 
serum with a mean concentration of 1 μg/mL. FHR-3 levels in patients were 
significantly increased in sera from systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica but remained almost unchanged in samples 
from AMD or aHUS patients. Moreover, by immunostaining of an aged human donor 
retina, we discovered a local FHR-3 production by microglia/macrophages. The mAb 
RETC-2 modulated FHR-3 binding to C3b but not the binding of FHR-3 to heparin. 
Interestingly, FHR-3 competed with FH for binding C3b and the mAb RETC-2 reduced 
the interaction of FHR-3 and C3b, resulting in increased FH binding. Our results 
unveil a previously unknown systemic involvement of FHR-3 in rheumatoid diseases 
and a putative local role of FHR-3 mediated by microglia/macrophages in the 
damaged retina. We conclude that the local FHR-3/FH equilibrium in AMD is a 
potential therapeutic target, which can be modulated by our specific mAb RETC-2.
