To explore the potential applicability of recombinant adeno-associated virus 
(rAAV) vectors in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary human 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) derived from patients with RA were infected 
with rAAV encoding mouse IL-10 under the control of the CMV promoter. Addition 
of the proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (zLLL) to 
the cultures dramatically enhanced expression of the IL-10 transgene, in a 
dose-dependent manner. The increased expression was transient, peaking at 3 days 
and returning to near baseline by 7 days. The enhancement was observed even when 
zLLL was added 13 days after infection with rAAV. The effect of zLLL was not 
specific to either the mIL-10 transgene or the CMV promoter, as similar findings 
were observed using an rAAV construct encoding alpha1-anti-trypsin under the 
control of the chick beta-actin promoter or GFP, driven by the CMV promoter. 
Transgene expression could be repeatedly induced by reexposure to zLLL. 
Transgene mRNA levels increased in parallel with protein levels. Transgene 
expression could also be repeatedly induced in vivo by administering zLLL to 
SCID mice previously injected with rAAV-infected FLS. These data demonstrate 
that proteasome inhibition can dramatically enhance transgene expression in 
human RA FLS following infection with rAAV and suggest a possible approach to 
regulating synovial transgene expression in vivo.
