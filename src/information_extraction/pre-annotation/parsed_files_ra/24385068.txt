The inflammation amplifier, a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)feedback loop in 
non-immune cells including fibroblasts and endothelial cells, describes how 
NF-kB-mediated transcriptions are enhanced to induce the inflammation in the 
presence of signal Tranducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) 
activation. It was originally discovered in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 
sclerosis mouse models and has since been shown to be associated with various 
human diseases and disorders including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndromes, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and other inflammatory diseases. The amplifier 
begins with IL-17, which acts as the main signal to express NF-kB-mediated 
transcriptions, and IL-6, an NF-kB target, which functions as a fuel for the 
inflammation amplifier. Indeed, other NF-kB targets including various chemokines 
also act as effector molecules that cause local accumulation of various immune 
cells and subsequent inflammation. Through extensive studies in the multiple 
sclerosis model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we recently 
demonstrated that regional neural activation induces excess activation of the 
inflammation amplifier at specific blood vessels in the fifth lumbar cord, 
creating a gateway for immune cells to enter the central nervous system (CNS). 
We thus propose the gateway theory to describe how regional neural activation 
enables immune cells to enter the CNS from the blood and argue that this theory 
might provide novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases and disorders.
