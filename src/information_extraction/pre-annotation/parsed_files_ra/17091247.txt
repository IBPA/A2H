The FcR are a crucial link in the immune response between humoral and cellular 
immunity and cell-based effector systems, mediating a wide variety of 
physiological and biochemical responses. The FcR for IgG (FcgammaR) and in 
particular the most widely expressed of these, FcgammaRII, are important in 
regulating adaptive immunity. Disruption of their function is a key factor in 
the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which are characterized by chronic, 
multi-organ inflammation. Studies of the FcgammaRII include structure/function 
relationships, investigation of the associations between FcR polymorphisms and 
human disease and animal studies using knockout or transgenic mouse models. 
These investigations showed that the various forms of FcgammaRII interact with 
immune complexes to either initiate or inhibit inflammation. In conjunction with 
environmental antigens and genotype, the FcgammaRII activating and inhibitory 
receptors determine the nature and magnitude of response to antigens. In this 
review, the structure and function of the FcgammaRIIs and their role in immune 
complex-mediated auto-immunity are discussed.
