Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are characterized by their 
hematopoiesis-supporting and immunosuppressive capacity, while osteoclasts are 
main cell components in the endosteal hematopoietic stem cell niche and pivotal 
players in osteoimmunology. To clarify the association of these 2 kinds of 
cells, mouse CD11b(+) monocytes were cultured onto MSC layers in the presence or 
absence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator 
of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). The results showed that MSCs independently 
supported osteoclast development and this effect was enhanced by M-CSF and 
RANKL. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated MSCs 
turned to inhibit osteoclast formation and protect tusk slices from osteoclastic 
resorption. Real-time PCR and ELISA assays demonstrated that osteoprotegerin 
expression at both mRNA and protein levels in TNF-alpha-stimulated MSCs was 
up-regulated, at least partially by activating the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase pathway. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-stimulated MSCs maintained their 
immunophenotypic, multipotential differentiation and immunosuppressive 
characteristics. Moreover, MSCs treated with synovial fluid from rheumatoid 
arthritis patients modulated osteoclast generation in close relation with the 
TNF-alpha levels. This study suggests that MSCs exhibit dual modulatory function 
on osteoclasts and the result might shed light on understanding the involvement 
of MSCs in the inflammatory diseases.
