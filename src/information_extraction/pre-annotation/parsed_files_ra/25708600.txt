OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of niclosamide in 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and inhibitory effects on migration and 
invasion in RA FLS and investigated the signal mechanism, and further explored 
the treatment activity of niclosamide on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,IL-17A and 
interferon (IFN)-γ in cultural supernatants were measured by multiplex cytokine 
assay kits. RA FLS migration and invasion in vitro were measured by the Boyden 
chamber method and the scratch assay. Signal transduction proteins expression 
was measured by western blot. The in vivo suppressive effects of niclosamide 
were elucidated on CIA in a mouse model.
RESULTS: Niclosamide reduced the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A and 
IFN-γ from TNF-α-induced RA FLS in a dose-dependent manner. Niclosamide inhibits 
FBS-induced migration and invasion and exhibits F-actin alterations in RA FLS. 
Niclosamide decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK in 
TNF-α-stimulated RA FLS and blocked TNF-α-induced IKK, IκBα phosphorylation and 
translocation of p65. Niclosamide treatments reduced the severity of CIA model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest for the first time that niclosamide posses the 
anti-inflammatory effect in RA both in vitro and in vivo.
