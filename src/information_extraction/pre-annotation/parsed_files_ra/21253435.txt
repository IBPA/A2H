Rodent models of immune-mediated arthritis (RMIA) are the conventional approach 
to evaluating mechanisms of inflammatory joint disease and the comparative 
efficacy of antiarthritic agents. Rat adjuvant-induced (AIA), collagen-induced 
(CIA), and streptococcal cell wall-induced (SCW) arthritides are preferred 
models of the joint pathology that occurs in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Lesions of AIA are most severe and consistent; structural and immunological 
changes of CIA best resemble RA. Lesion extent and severity in RMIA depends on 
experimental methodology (inciting agent, adjuvant, etc.) and individual 
physiologic parameters (age, genetics, hormonal status, etc.). The effectiveness 
of antiarthritic molecules varies with the agent, therapeutic regimen, and 
choice of RMIA. All RMIA are driven by overactivity of proinflammatory pathways, 
but the dominant molecules differ among the models. Hence, as with the human 
clinical experience, the efficacy of various antiarthritic molecules differs 
among RMIA, especially when the agent is a specific cytokine inhibitor.
