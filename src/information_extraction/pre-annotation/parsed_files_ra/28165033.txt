A major obstacle to therapy in intensive care units is sepsis caused by severe 
infection. In recent years gram-positive (G+) bacteria, most commonly 
staphylococci, are thought to be the main pathogens. Micheliolide (MCL) was 
demonstrated to provide a therapeutic role in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory 
intestinal disease, colitis-associated cancer, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, the 
main component of G- bacterial cell wall) induced septic shock. We proved here 
that MCL played an anti-inflammatory role in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) 
and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) induced peritonitis. It inhibited the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages and dendritic 
cells upon stimulation with peptidoglycan (PGN, the main cell wall composition 
of G+ bacteria). PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways account for the anti-inflammatory 
role of MCL after PGN stimulation. MCL reduced IL-6 secretion through 
down-regulating NF-κB activation and improved the survival status in mice 
challenged with a lethal dose of S. aureus. In MRSA infection mouse model, MCL 
down-regulated the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1/CCL2 and IFN-γ in sera, and 
ameliorated the organ damage of liver and kidney. In conclusion, MCL can help 
maintain immune equilibrium and decrease PGN, S. aureus and MRSA-triggered 
inflammatory response. These provide the rationality for the potential usage of 
MCL in sepsis caused by G+ bacteria (e.g., S. aureus) and antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria (e.g., MRSA).
