The involvement of autoreactive T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) as well as in autoimmune animal models of arthritis has been well 
established; however, unanswered questions, such as the role of joint-homing T 
cells, remain. Animal models of arthritis are superb experimental tools in 
demonstrating how T cells trigger joint inflammation, and thus can help to 
further our knowledge of disease mechanisms and potential therapies. In this 
Review, we discuss the similarities and differences in T-cell subsets and 
functions between RA and mouse arthritis models. For example, various T-cell 
subsets are involved in both human and mouse arthritis, but differences might 
exist in the cytokine regulation and plasticity of these cells. With regard to 
joint-homing T cells, an abundance of synovial T cells is present in humans 
compared with mice. On the other hand, local expansion of type 17 T-helper 
(TH17) cells is observed in some animal models, but not in RA. Finally, whereas 
T-cell depletion therapy essentially failed in RA, antibody targeting of T cells 
can work, at least preventatively, in most arthritis models. Clearly, additional 
human and animal studies are needed to fill the gap in our understanding of the 
specific contribution of T-cell subsets to arthritis in mice and men.
