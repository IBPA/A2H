Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are two prevalent chronic inflammatory 
diseases in humans and are associated with each other both clinically and 
epidemiologically. Recent findings suggest a causative link between periodontal 
infection and rheumatoid arthritis via bacteria-dependent induction of a 
pathogenic autoimmune response to citrullinated epitopes. Here we showed that 
infection with viable periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83 
exacerbated collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a mouse model, as manifested by 
earlier onset, accelerated progression and enhanced severity of the disease, 
including significantly increased bone and cartilage destruction. The ability of 
P. gingivalis to augment CIA was dependent on the expression of a unique P. 
gingivalis peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD), which converts arginine residues 
in proteins to citrulline. Infection with wild type P. gingivalis was 
responsible for significantly increased levels of autoantibodies to collagen 
type II and citrullinated epitopes as a PPAD-null mutant did not elicit similar 
host response. High level of citrullinated proteins was also detected at the 
site of infection with wild-type P. gingivalis. Together, these results suggest 
bacterial PAD as the mechanistic link between P. gingivalis periodontal 
infection and rheumatoid arthritis.
