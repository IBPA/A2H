Biological agents targeting tumour necrosis factor (TNF) have revolutionised the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and clinical remission has become a 
realistic treatment goal. Discontinuing anti-TNF therapy after sustained 
remission has emerged as an important area of investigation in rheumatology from 
the risk-benefit point of view, including health economic considerations. 
However, there is little information as to whether 'biologic-free remission' is 
possible after sustained remission following intensive treatment with TNF 
inhibitors in RA. European studies such as BeSt and OPTIMA in patients with 
early RA and Japanese studies such as remission induction by remicade in 
patients with RA and HONOR in patients with long-standing RA encountered during 
routine clinical practice have shown that, after a reduction in disease activity 
to clinical remission or low disease activity by infliximab or adalimumab in 
combination with methotrexate, patients can successfully remain in clinical 
remission without TNF inhibitors with no radiological and functional damage 
progression of articular destruction. Experimental findings in TNF-deficient 
mouse models suggest that TNF inhibitors may change the disease process of RA 
and bring about the potential of immunological remission, raising the 
possibility of a 'treatment holiday' of TNF inhibitors after intensive 
treatment.
