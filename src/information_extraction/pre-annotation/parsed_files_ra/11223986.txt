The development of transcriptionally controlled systems which function in 
eukaryotic cells are important for achieving regulated gene expression in gene 
therapy. In this study we combined the components of the tetracycline-inducible 
system in self-contained retroviral and plasmid vectors. Regulated reporter gene 
expression from the autoregulatory plasmid pGTRTL in response to doxycycline 
(Dox) induction surpasses the expression observed from other self-contained 
retroviral and plasmid vectors. Induction kinetics and expression levels of 
luciferase and the therapeutic molecule, truncated soluble complement receptor 1 
(sCR1) were characterised in a mouse fibroblast and a human neuroblastoma cell 
line. The regulatory characteristics of the plasmids were shown to be optimal 
for gene therapy applications, as there was a rapid reduction in expression 
levels following removal of Dox. Co-transfection of cells with an autoregulatory 
plasmid and a Dox inducible enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid 
demonstrated the feasibility of using this plasmid combination to achieve 
parallel regulation of two genes of interest in a single cell under the control 
of Dox. These novel autoregulatory plasmids display the requirements for gene 
therapy applications in chronic conditions which are remitting/relapsing such as 
rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, where novel protein therapeutics and 
combination therapies are needed. Gene Therapy (2000) 7, 2061-2070.
