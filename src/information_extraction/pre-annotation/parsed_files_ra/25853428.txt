BACKGROUND: Currently, natural products have built a well-recognized role in the 
management of many degenerative diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis. Recent 
studies suggest that Spirulina, a unicellular blue-green alga, may have a 
variety of health benefits and curative properties and is also competent of 
acting as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and recently anti-angiogenic agent. 
In the present study, the antioxidant and the immunomodulatory effect of 
Spirulina platensis as well as its anti-angiogenic effect against complete 
Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rat model were tested.
RESULTS: We found that the development of arthritis was concealed; moreover it 
successfully inhibited the development of macroscopic as well as microscopic and 
histopathological lesions in AIA rats when compared to control. Spirulina 
treated group showed a higher survival rate and moreover, it reduced the 
clinical score of RA in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Spirulina 
decreased serum levels of COX-2, TNF-Î±, IL-6, TBARS, VEGF and increased serum 
levels of GSH compared to the RA non-treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that Spirulina is able to restrain the 
changes produced through adjuvant-induced arthritis. The suppressing effect of 
Spirulina could be attributed, at least in part, to anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant and anti-angiogenic properties.
