Synoviolin (Syvn1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase in endoplasmic reticulum‑associated 
protein degradation, is involved in rheumatoid arthritis, fibrosis, liver 
cirrhosis and obesity. We previously demonstrated that Syvn1 negatively 
regulates the function of peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor gamma 
coactivator‑1β (PGC‑1β). In addition, treatment with a Syvn1 inhibitor 
suppressed weight gain in a mouse model of obesity by activating PGC‑1β via 
Syvn1 inhibition. It has been suggested that the Syvn1 inhibitors may have 
therapeutic benefits in obese patients. The present study tested the inhibitory 
activity of walnut extract, a natural product, on Syvn1 activity. Walnut extract 
inhibited the effect of Syvn1 on the cell proliferation of rheumatoid synovial 
cells and repressed the interaction between PGC‑1β and Syvn1 in an in vitro 
binding assay. Polyubiquitination of PGC‑1β by Syvn1 was suppressed by walnut 
extract in a concentration‑dependent manner, but walnut extract did not have an 
inhibitory effect on the autoubiquitination of Syvn1. Treatment with walnut 
extract in mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased the number of mitochondria, 
suggesting that exposure to the extract recovered PGC‑1β function. These results 
demonstrated that constituents of walnut extract may serve as lead compounds in 
drug development efforts aiming to produce drugs to treat patients with obesity 
and obesity‑associated metabolic diseases.
