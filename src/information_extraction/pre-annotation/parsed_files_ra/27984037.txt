IL-6 inhibition has been unsuccessful in treating psoriasis, despite high levels 
of tissue and serum IL-6 in patients. In addition, de novo psoriasis onset has 
been reported after IL-6 blockade in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To 
explore mechanisms underlying these clinical observations, we backcrossed an 
established psoriasiform mouse model (IL-17C+ mice) with IL-6-deficient mice 
(IL-17C+KO) and examined the cutaneous phenotype. IL-17C+KO mice initially 
exhibited decreased skin inflammation; however, this decrease was transient and 
reversed rapidly, concomitant with increases in skin Tnf, Il36α/β/γ, Il24, Epgn, 
and S100a8/a9 to levels higher than those found in IL-17C+ mice. A comparison of 
IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO mouse skin transcriptomes with that of human psoriasis 
skin revealed significant correlation among transcripts of skin of patients with 
psoriasis and IL-17C+KO mouse skin, and confirmed an exacerbation of the 
inflammatory signature in IL-17C+KO mice that aligns closely with human 
psoriasis. Transcriptional analyses of IL-17C+ and IL-17C+KO primary 
keratinocytes confirmed increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, 
suggesting that in the absence of IL-6, keratinocytes increase production of 
numerous additional proinflammatory cytokines. These preclinical findings may 
provide insight into why patients with arthritis being treated with IL-6 
inhibitors develop new onset psoriasis and why IL-6 blockade for the treatment 
of psoriasis has not been clinically effective.
