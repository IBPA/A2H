FK506 (Tacrolimus) is a potent inhibitor of calcineurin that blocks IL2 
production and is widely used to prevent transplant rejection and treat 
autoimmunity. FK506 treatment of dendritic cells (FKDC) limits their capacity to 
stimulate T cell responses. FK506 does not prevent DC survival, maturation, or 
costimulatory molecule expression, suggesting that the limited capacity of FKDC 
to stimulate T cells may be due to inhibition of calcineurin signaling in the 
DC. Instead, we demonstrate that DC inhibit T cells by sequestering FK506 and 
continuously releasing the drug over several days. T cells encountering FKDC 
proliferate but fail to upregulate the survival factor bcl-xl and die, and IL2 
restores both bcl-xl and survival. In mice, FKDC act in an antigen-specific 
manner to inhibit T-cell mediated autoimmune arthritis. This establishes that 
DCs can act as a cellular drug delivery system to target antigen specific T 
cells.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00105.001.
