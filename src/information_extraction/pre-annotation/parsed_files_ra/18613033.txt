Dexamethasone (DEX) is often given for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and 
clinical dosing regimens of DEX have often been based empirically. This study 
tests whether the inflammation processes in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis 
alters the clearance and volume of distribution of DEX when compared with 
healthy controls. Groups of healthy and arthritic male Lewis rats received 
either a low (0.225 mg/kg) or high (2.25 mg/kg) intramuscular dose of DEX. 
Arthritis was induced by intradermal injection of type II porcine collagen in 
incomplete Freund's adjuvant emulsion at the base of the tail. DEX was dosed in 
the arthritic animals 22 days post arthritis induction. Plasma DEX 
concentrations were determined by HPLC. Plasma concentration versus time data 
were analysed by non-compartmental analysis and pharmacokinetic model fitting 
using the population pharmacokinetic software NONMEM V. A linear bi-exponential 
pharmacokinetic model with extravascular input described the data for both 
healthy and arthritic animals. Clearance was the only parameter determined 
statistically different between both groups (healthy=1.05 l/h/kg, arthritic=1.19 
l/h/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution for both groups was 4.85 l/kg. 
The slight difference in clearance was visibly undetectable and unlikely to 
produce meaningful changes in DEX disposition in arthritic rats.
