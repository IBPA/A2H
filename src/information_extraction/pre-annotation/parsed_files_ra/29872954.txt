Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection can cause severe arthralgia and chronic 
arthritis in humans. MicroRNAs (miRNA) have demonstrated their potential use as 
biomarker in variety of human pathologies and infections. This study was 
conducted to understand the miRNA signature in early CHIKV infection stages. In 
the current study, we used TaqMan-based quantitative PCR method to identify the 
miRNA signature of host response upon CHIKV infection in human and mouse 
fibroblast cells. The GO enrichment analysis suggests that the putative target 
genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs are to be involved in RIG-I 
pathway, TGF-beta-signaling pathway, JAK-STAT-signaling pathway, MAPK-signaling 
pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and Fc gamma R-mediated 
phagocytosis. The results obtained in the current study and earlier studies 
indicate the potential use of miR15, miR-16, miR-17, let-7e, miR-125, miR-99, 
and miR-23a as a biomarker in CHIKV infection. miRNAs such as miR-15a, miR-16, 
miR-140, miR-146a, miR-155, miR203, miR223, miR-499, and miR-363 which are 
implicated in rheumatoid arthritis showed differential regulation in CHIKV 
infection. The data obtained in this study provide valuable information on 
CHIKV-induced miRNA expression in mammalian fibroblast cells, and suggest that 
CHIKV may establish infection by regulating miRNA expression profile.
