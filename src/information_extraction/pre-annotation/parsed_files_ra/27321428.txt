AA amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease characterized by extracellular 
deposition of amyloid A (AA) fibrils. AA amyloidosis has been identified in food 
animals, and it has been postulated that AA amyloidosis may be transmissible to 
different animal species. Since the precursor protein of AA fibrils is serum 
amyloid A (SAA), which is an inflammatory acute phase protein, AA amyloidosis is 
considered to be associated with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. Chronic diseases such as autoimmune disease and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus could be potential factors for AA amyloidosis. In this study, to 
examine the relationship between the induction of AA amyloidosis and chromic 
abnormalities such as autoimmune disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus, amyloid 
fibrils from mice, cattle, or chickens were experimentally injected into disease 
model mice. Wild-type mice were used as controls. The concentrations of SAA, 
IL-6, and IL-10 in autoimmune disease model mice were higher than those of 
control mice. However, induction of AA amyloidosis in autoimmune disease and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus model mice was lower than that in control mice, and the 
amount of amyloid deposits in the spleens of both mouse models was lower than 
that of control mice according to Congo red staining and immunohistochemistry. 
These results suggest that factors other than SAA levels, such as an 
inflammatory or anti-inflammatory environment in the immune response, may be 
involved in amyloid deposition.
