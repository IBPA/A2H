Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and rheumatoid arthritis are two 
conditions in which neurogenic mechanisms may play a critical role. We 
investigated the neurogenic contribution underlying acute TMJ inflammation by 
evaluating effects of local anesthetic blockade of afferent innervation on the 
development of mustard oil (MO)-induced edema in the rat TMJ area. Groups of 
eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal 
alpha-chloralose and urethane. A saline injection into the right TMJ followed by 
MO (1% to 60%) 6 min later elicited dose-dependent edema development (P < 0.05, 
repeated measures analysis of variance). Lidocaine (5%) or bupivacaine (0.5%) 
followed by MO (1% or 40%) did not produce edema development different from 
saline controls (P > 0.05, repeated measures analysis of variance). The failure 
of local anesthetic blockade to prevent MO-induced edema is not consistent with 
MO acting through a neurogenic mechanism, as traditionally perceived.
IMPLICATIONS: Inflammation found in temporomandibular disorders and rheumatoid 
arthritis may result from mediators released by pain-sensing neurons. Local 
anesthesia failed to block simulated neurogenic temporomandibular inflammation 
in a rat model, suggesting that functional neuronal input may not be necessary 
for the promotion of inflammation.
