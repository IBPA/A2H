Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disorder 
characterized by synovitis that leads to cartilage and bone erosion by invading 
fibrovascular tissue. Mouse models of RA recapitulate many features of the human 
disease. Despite the availability of medicines that are highly effective in many 
patient populations, autoimmune diseases (including RA) remain an area of active 
biomedical research, and consequently mouse models of RA are still extensively 
used for mechanistic studies and validation of therapeutic targets. This review 
aims to integrate morphologic features with model biology and cover the key 
characteristics of the most commonly used induced and spontaneous mouse models 
of RA. Induced models emphasized in this review include collagen-induced 
arthritis and antibody-induced arthritis. Collagen-induced arthritis is an 
example of an active immunization strategy, whereas antibody- induced arthritis 
models, such as collagen antibody-induced arthritis and K/BxN antibody transfer 
arthritis, represent examples of passive immunization strategies. The coverage 
of spontaneous models in this review is focused on the TNFΔ (ARE) mouse, in 
which arthritis results from overexpression of TNF-α, a master proinflammatory 
cytokine that drives disease in many patients.
