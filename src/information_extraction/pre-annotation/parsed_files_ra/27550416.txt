Receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL) is critically involved in 
bone erosion of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously reported association 
between younger age at onset of RA and a RANKL promoter SNP that conferred an 
elevated promoter activity via binding to a transcription factor SOX5. Here we 
study the regulation of SOX5 levels in relation to RANKL expression in RA 
synovial fibroblasts (SF) and the development of bone erosion in the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse. Our data indicated SOX5 levels were 
higher in synovium and synovial fluid from RA compared to osteoarthritis 
patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SOX5 and RANKL expression in 
both primary RA SF and the rheumatoid synovial fibroblast cell line, MH7A. 
Overexpression of SOX5 resulted in significantly increased RANKL levels, while 
knockdown of SOX5 resulted in diminished IL-6 mediated RANKL upregulation in 
MH7A cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed approximately 3-fold 
enrichment of RANKL-specific DNA in anti-SOX5 immunoprecipitate in IL-6 treated 
MH7A cells as compared to untreated cells. Locally silencing SOX5 gene 
significantly diminished RANKL positive cells and bone erosion in CIA mice. 
These findings suggest SOX5 is an important regulator of IL-6-induced RANKL 
expression in RA SF.
