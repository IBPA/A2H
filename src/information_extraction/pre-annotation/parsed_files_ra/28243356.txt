Inflammation is the major causative factor of different diseases such as 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the 
first step of treatment in many of these diseases. The present study is aimed at 
evaluating the anti-inflammatory properties of isoorientin, a selective 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor isolated from the tubers of Pueraria 
tuberosa, in vitro on mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and in vivo on 
mouse paw edema and air pouch models of inflammation. Isoorientin reduced 
inflammation in RAW 264.7 cell line in vitro and carrageenan induced 
inflammatory animal model systems in vivo. Cellular infiltration into pouch 
tissue was reduced in isoorientin treated mice compared to carrageenan treated 
mice. Isoorientin treated RAW 264.7 cells and animals showed reduced expression 
of inflammatory proteins like COX-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and interleukin 1-β (IL-1-β) both 
in vitro and in vivo. The antioxidant enzyme levels of catalase and GST were 
markedly increased in isoorientin treated mice compared to carrageenan treated 
mice. These results suggest that isoorientin, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, 
not only exerts anti-inflammatory effects in LPS induced RAW cells and 
carrageenan induced inflammatory model systems but also exhibits potent 
antioxidant properties.
