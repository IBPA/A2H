Agkistrodon in Chinese medicine has long been used as an effective treatment 
against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present research further investigated the 
effects of peptides extracted from the crude Agkistrodon on the RA rat model. 
Extracted peptides were separated by parameter-optimized ion-exchange 
chromatography (IEC), peptide fractions were further analysed by MALDI-TOF/TOF 
MS, and nano-LC-MS/MS acquired mass spectra were further characterized using 
Mascot software, which ranks the best matches in the NCBI database. RT-PCR 
results in RAW264.7 cells indicated that Agkistrodon peptide components had 
inhibitory effects against inflammatory cytokines. The therapeutic efficacy of 
Agkistrodon peptides was evaluated on the Wistar rats with collagen-induced 
arthritis. Symptom relief and reduced cartilage destruction and bone erosion 
were observed, which can be explained by the direct suppression of inflammatory 
cytokines in the joints. Agkistrodon peptides downregulate the expression of 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which may alleviate cartilage destruction and bone 
erosion, thus relieving symptoms of RA.
