Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes, multiple 
sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, constitute an 
important and growing public health burden. However, in many cases our 
understanding of disease biology is limited and available therapies vary greatly 
in their efficacy and safety. Animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases have provided valuable tools to researchers investigating their 
aetiology, pathology, and novel therapeutic strategies. Although such models 
vary in the degree to which they reflect human autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases and caution is required in the extrapolation of animal data to the 
clinical setting, therapeutic approaches first evaluated in established animal 
models, including collagen-induced arthritis, experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis, and the nonobese diabetic mouse, have successfully progressed 
to clinical investigation and practice. Similarly, these models have proven 
useful in providing support for basic hypotheses regarding the underlying causes 
and pathology of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here we review selected 
murine models of autoimmunity and inflammation and efforts to translate findings 
from these models into both basic insights into disease biology and novel 
therapeutic strategies.
