Paeoniflorin (PF), extracted from the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall, exhibits 
anti-inflammatory properties in several autoimmune diseases. Osteoclast, the 
only somatic cell with bone resorbing capacity, was the direct cause of bone 
destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its mouse model, collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of PF on 
CIA mice, and explore the mechanism of PF in bone destruction. We demonstrated 
that PF treatment significantly ameliorated CIA through inflammatory response 
inhibition and bone destruction suppression. Furthermore, PF treatment markedly 
decreased osteoclast number through the altered RANKL/RANK/OPG ratio and 
inflammatory cytokines profile. Consistently, we found that osteoclast 
differentiation was significantly inhibited by PF through down-regulation of 
nuclear factor-κB activation in vitro. Moreover, we found that PF suppressed 
nuclear factor-κB activation by decreasing its translocation to the nucleus in 
osteoclast precursor cells. Taken together, our new findings provide insights 
into a novel function of PF in osteoclastogenesis and demonstrate that PF would 
be a new therapeutic modality as a natural agent for RA treatment and other 
autoimmune conditions with bone erosion.
