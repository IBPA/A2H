OBJECTIVE: Bradykinin (BK) stimulates bone resorption in vitro and 
synergistically potentiates interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced bone resorption and 
prostaglandin (PG) formation, suggesting that kinins are important in 
inflammation-induced bone loss. The present study was undertaken to study 1) the 
role of the kinin B1 and B2 receptors in the synergistic interaction with IL-1 
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), 2) the molecular mechanisms involved 
in synergistic enhancement of PG formation, and 3) the effects of kinins on 
cytokine-induced expression of RANKL, RANK, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (the 
latter being crucial molecules in osteoclast differentiation).
METHODS: Formation of PGs, expression of enzymes involved in arachidonic acid 
metabolism, and expression of RANKL, RANK, and OPG were assessed in the human 
osteoblastic cell line MG-63 and in mouse calvarial bones. The role of NF-kappaB 
and MAP kinases was studied using pharmacologic inhibitors.
RESULTS: PGE(2) formation and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) protein expression were 
induced by IL-1beta and potentiated by kinins with affinity for the B1 or B2 
receptors, resulting in PGE(2)-dependent enhancement of RANKL. The enhancements 
of PGE(2) formation and COX-2 were markedly decreased by inhibition of p38 and 
JNK MAP kinases, whereas inhibition of NF-kappaB resulted in abolishment of the 
PGE(2) response with only slight inhibition of COX-2.
CONCLUSION: Kinin B1 and B2 receptors synergistically potentiate IL-1- and 
TNFalpha-induced PG biosynthesis in osteoblasts by a mechanism involving 
increased levels of COX-2, resulting in increased RANKL. The synergistic 
stimulation is dependent on NF-kappaB and MAP kinases. These mechanisms might 
help to explain the enhanced bone resorption associated with inflammatory 
disorders, including that in rheumatoid arthritis.
