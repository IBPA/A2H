A therapeutic rationale is proposed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by specific targeting of the JAK1 pathway. 
Examination of the preferred binding conformation of clinically effective, 
pan-JAK inhibitor 1 led to identification of a novel, tricyclic hinge binding 
scaffold 3. Exploration of SAR through a series of cycloamino and 
cycloalkylamino analogues demonstrated this template to be highly tolerant of 
substitution, with a predisposition to moderate selectivity for the JAK1 isoform 
over JAK2. This study culminated in the identification of subnanomolar JAK1 
inhibitors such as 22 and 49, having excellent cell potency, good rat 
pharmacokinetic characteristics, and excellent kinase selectivity. Determination 
of the binding modes of the series in JAK1 and JAK2 by X-ray crystallography 
supported the design of analogues to enhance affinity and selectivity.
