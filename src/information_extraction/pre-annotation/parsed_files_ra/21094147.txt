Abnormal lung inflammation and oxidant burden are associated with a significant 
reduction in histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) abundance and steroid resistance. We 
hypothesized that Nrf2 regulates steroid sensitivity via HDAC2 in response to 
inflammation in mouse lung. Furthermore, HDAC2 deficiency leads to steroid 
resistance in attenuating lung inflammatory response, which may be due to 
oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. Loss of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 
resulted in decreased HDAC2 level in lung, and increased inflammatory lung 
response which was not reversed by steroid. Thus, steroid resistance or 
inability of steroids to control lung inflammatory response is dependent on 
Nrf2-HDAC2 axis. These findings have implications in steroid resistance, 
particularly during the conditions of oxidative stress when the lungs are more 
susceptible to inflammatory response, which is seen in patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory 
bowel disease.
