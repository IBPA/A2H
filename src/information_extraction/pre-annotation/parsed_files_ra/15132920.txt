AIM: To investigate the effect of overall alkali of Tongbiling(TBL) on CD69 
expression on activated mouse T lymphocytes and its possible mechanism.
METHODS: Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate(PDB) or concanavalin (ConA) were added 
successively into mouse lymphocytic culture with various concentration of 
overall alkali TBL. After 24 hours, CD69 expression rate on mouse T lymphocytes 
activated with PDB or ConA was analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Overall alkali TBL could significantly down-regulate CD69 expression in 
a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: Overall alkali TBL can significantly inhibit CD69 expression on 
activated mouse T lymphocytes. This study provided an experimental basis for 
application of overall alkali TBL to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
