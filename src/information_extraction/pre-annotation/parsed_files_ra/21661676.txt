Stromal cell-derived factor-1 is a dominant chemokine in bone marrow that is 
known to be involved in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. 
Its role in bone repair has recently been demonstrated. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the role of extraneous stromal cell-derived factor-1 in 
fracture healing.
