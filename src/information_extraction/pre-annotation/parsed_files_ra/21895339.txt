Although glucocorticoids are frequently prescribed for the symptomatic 
management of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, extended 
glucocorticoid exposure is the leading cause of physician-induced osteoporosis 
and leaves patients at a high risk of fracture. To study the biochemical effects 
of glucocorticoid exposure and how they might affect biomechanical properties of 
the bone, Raman spectra were acquired from ex vivo tibiae of glucocorticoid- and 
placebo-treated wild-type mice and a transgenic mouse model of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Statistically significant spectral differences were observed due to 
both treatment regimen and mouse genotype. These differences are attributed to 
changes in the overall bone mineral composition, as well as the degree of 
phosphate mineralization in tibial cortical bone. In addition, partial least 
squares regression was used to generate a Raman-based prediction of each tibia's 
biomechanical strength as quantified by a torsion test. The Raman-based 
predictions were as accurate as those produced by microcomputed tomography 
derived parameters, and more accurate than the clinically-used parameter of bone 
mineral density. These results suggest that Raman spectroscopy could be a 
valuable tool for monitoring bone biochemistry in studies of bone diseases such 
as osteoporosis, including tests of drugs being developed to combat these 
diseases.
