Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells, and play an 
important role in the induction of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. However, 
some DC populations are involved in immune regulation and immune tolerance. 
These DC populations are believed to take part in the control of immune 
exaggeration and immune disorder, and maintain immune homeostasis in the body. 
Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) can be generated in vitro by genetic or pharmacological 
modification or by controlling the maturation stages of cytokine-derived DCs. 
These tolDCs have been investigated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in experimental animal models. In the last decade, several in vitro and in 
vivo approaches have been translated into clinical trials. As of 2015, three 
tolDC trials for RA are on the list of ClinicalTrial.gov 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov). Other trials for RA are in progress and will be listed 
soon. In this review, we discuss the evolution of tolDC-based immunotherapy for 
RA and its limitations and future prospects.
