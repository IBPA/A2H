BACKGROUND: Rat bite fever is a relatively rare infectious disease due to 
infection with Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus mainly via 
directs bite by rats, mice, or other rodents. If there is no clear bite history, 
the diagnosis is difficult or may not be made.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Asian female with rheumatoid arthritis was 
admitted for high grade fever and walking difficulty with severe lumbago. 
Initially, we suspected lumber compression fracture with deterioration of 
rheumatoid arthritis, but Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from blood culture 
during hospitalization. The isolated organism was identified as S. moniliformis 
by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing. S. moniliformis is well 
known to be a primary causative organism of rat bite fever, but this patient had 
no history of rat bite. Had S. moniliformis bacteremia not been detected, she 
might have been treated for rheumatic exacerbation.
CONCLUSION: We emphasize the importance of performing appropriate microbial 
culture testing for identifying potential infectious diseases. We also conclude 
that S. moniliformis infection can become established with contaminated vehicle 
contact alone, not only as a direct result of a bite. We must keep mind that 
those working in places where rodents breed or are at risk of contact with rats 
or mice might be at risk for contracting this unusual disease.
