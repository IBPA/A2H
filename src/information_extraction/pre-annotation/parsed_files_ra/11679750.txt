The Fas-Fas ligand system is involved in apoptosis. The mouse anti-human Fas 
monoclonal antibody HFE7A (m-HFE7A) has a potential use in human therapy against 
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Information on the 
three-dimensional structure is essential for antibody humanization. Crystals of 
an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of m-HFE7A were obtained by the hanging-drop 
vapour-diffusion method using sodium citrate as a precipitant and 
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as an additive. Fast optimization to produce single 
crystals suitable for X-ray analysis was achieved by the streak-seeding 
technique. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), 
with unit-cell parameters a = 43.4, b = 74.0, c = 133.8 A. The crystals diffract 
at least to 2.5 A resolution.
