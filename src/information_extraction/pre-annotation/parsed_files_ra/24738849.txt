Isogarcinol is a natural compound that we extracted from Garcinia mangostana L., 
and we were the first to report that it is a new immunosuppressant. In the 
present study, we investigated the immune regulation and anti-inflammatory 
effects of isogarcinol on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and explored its 
potential mechanism in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The oral 
administration of isogarcinol significantly reduced clinical scores, alleviated 
cartilage and bone erosion, and reduced the levels of serum inflammatory 
cytokines in CIA mice. Isogarcinol inhibited xylene-induced mouse ear edema in 
vivo. In vitro, isogarcinol decreased iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression and NO 
content by inhibiting NF-ÎºB expression. Furthermore, isogarcinol decreased the 
activity of NFAT and inhibited IL-2 expression. The mechanism of action of 
isogarcinol is associated with down-regulation of both autoimmune and 
inflammatory reactions.
