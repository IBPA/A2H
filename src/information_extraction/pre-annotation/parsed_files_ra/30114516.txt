ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Paederia scandens (Lour.) Merr. (P. scandens) 
has been traditionally used to treat the pain of rheumatism.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible 
influences of P. scandens on the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
inflammatory responses and gut bacterial communities in RA mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were orally 
administered with P. scandens extract (PSE) for 24 days. Then, pro-inflammatory 
cytokine levels in the serum were measured, and gut microbiota was examined with 
Illumina HiSeq.
RESULTS: Compared with the vehicle group, PSE significantly inhibited paw 
swelling and reduced arthritis score. Histological examination of ankle soft 
tissue of demonstrated PSE effectively inhibited the tissue fibrosis and 
inflammatory cell infiltration. The increased serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-7, and IL-23 in RA mice were significantly suppressed by PSE. Moreover, 
PSE treatment help restore gut microbial ecosystem altered in RA mice including 
decreasing relative abundance of inflammatory related microorganisms, 
Desulfovibrio, Mucispirillum, Helicobacter, and Lachnospiraceae.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PSE has therapeutic effects in RA mice 
with CIA, showing the potential as anti-arthritis reagent.
