Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that process peptide bonds at the N-terminus 
of protein substrates, and they are involved in controlling several metabolic 
pathways. Due to their involvement in diseases such as cancer or rheumatoid 
arthritis, their presence can also be used as a predictive biomarker. Here, we 
used a library of fluorogenic substrates containing natural and unnatural amino 
acids to reliably measure the aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in cell lysates 
obtained from human, pig and rat kidneys. We compared our results to the 
substrate specificity profile of isolated APN. Our data strongly support the 
observation that fluorogenic substrates can be successfully used to identify 
aminopeptidases and to measure their activity in cell lysates. Moreover, in 
contrast to assays using single substrates, which can result in overlapping 
specificity due to cleavage by several aminopeptidases, our library fingerprint 
can provide information about single enzymes.
