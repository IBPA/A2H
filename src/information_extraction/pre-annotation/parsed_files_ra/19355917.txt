Toll-like receptors (TLRs) form a large family of pattern recognition receptors 
with at least 11 members in human and 13 in mouse. TLRs recognize a wide variety 
of microbial components and potential host-derived agonists that have emerged as 
key mediators of innate immunity. TLR signaling also plays an important role in 
the activation of the adaptive immune system by inducing proinflammatory 
cytokines and upregulating costimulatory molecules of antigen presenting cells. 
The dysregulation of TLR signaling may cause autoimmunity. This review discusses 
the contribution of TLR signaling to the initiation and progression of 
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune 
encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, kidney disease, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, diabetes, obesity, and experimental autoimmune uveitis as well as 
aging. The involvement of TLR signaling in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
diseases may provide novel targets for the development of therapeutics.
