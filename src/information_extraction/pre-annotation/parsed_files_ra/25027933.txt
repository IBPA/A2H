The discovery of potent inhibitors of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in 
recent years has been proven to be an important game changer in pharmaceutical 
industry. It is known that excessive production of PGE2 triggers a vast array of 
biological signals and physiological events that contributes to inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and pain. In 
this Letter, we report the synthesis of a series of minor prenylated chalcones 
and flavonoids which was found to be significantly active in suppressing the 
PGE2 production secreted by lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse macrophage cells 
(RAW 264.7). Among the compounds tested, 14b showed a dose-response inhibition 
of PGE2 production with an IC50 value of 2.1 Î¼M. The suppression upon PGE2 
secretion was not due to cell death since 14b did not reduce the cell viability 
in close proximity to the PGE2 inhibition concentration. The obtained atomic 
coordinates for the single-crystal XRD of 14b was then applied in the docking 
simulation to determine the potential important binding interactions with murine 
COX-2 and mPGES-1 putative binding sites.
