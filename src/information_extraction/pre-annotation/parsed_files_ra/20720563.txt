Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an autoimmune blistering disease, 
characterized by antibodies to type VII collagen (COL7). EBA can be induced in 
mice by immunization with a fragment of the non-collagenous 1 domain of murine 
COL7. Contrary to other autoimmune diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, little 
is known about the genetic susceptibility for EBA. We therefore used the EBA 
mouse model to address the hypothesis that disease induction depends on the 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype. Mice from different inbred 
strains were immunized with recombinant murine COL7. Five distinct responses 
were observed: induction of (i) severe disease in SJL/J (H2s) and female MRL/MpJ 
(H2k), (ii) mild and transient disease in C57Bl/10.s (H2s), (iii) microscopic 
blistering in DBA/1J (H2q), (iv) only presence of non-pathogenic autoantibodies 
in C57Bl/6J (H2b), NZM2410/J (H2z), BXD2 (H2b), and male MRL/MpJ, and (v) 
complete resistance to EBA in NOD/ShiLtJ (H2g7) and C57Bl/10.q (H2q) mice. 
Overall, susceptibility to EBA was strongly associated with H2s. In addition, 
the diseased phenotype was associated with autoantibodies to specific regions of 
COL7. Our findings show that induction of antibodies with a distinct specificity 
is linked to the MHC haplotype in experimental EBA. Furthermore, our data are 
the basis for future studies with the goal of identifying non-MHC EBA 
susceptibility genes.
