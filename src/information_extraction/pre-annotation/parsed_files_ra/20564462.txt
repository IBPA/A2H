Approaches inducing fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) apoptosis in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) patients have been considered as a promising strategy for 
treating RA. Here, adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rat was induced by complete 
Freund's adjuvant and FLS were separated and cultured using a tissue explant 
cultivation method. The apoptotic effect of 7,3'-dimethoxy hesperetin (DMHP, a 
highly antirheumatic active derivative of hesperidin) on AA FLS was evaluated 
with MTT assay, Hoechst staining and flow cytometry analysis. Bcl-2, Bax, 
caspase 3 gene expressions and caspase 3 activity were assayed to identify 
whether caspase 3 was involved in the apoptosis induced by DMHP. It was found 
that DMHP significantly decreased AA FLS proliferation in vitro by MTT assay. 
The AA FLS treated with DMHP displayed typical apoptotic characteristics 
including irregularity in shape, nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation. 
Flow cytometry analysis indicated that DMHP could obviously increase the AA FLS 
apoptosis rate. Compared with the AA-FLS control group, DMHP markedly decreased 
the mRNA expression of Bcl-2, whereas those of Bax and caspase 3 were increased. 
Moreover, DMHP significantly increased caspase 3 activity in a dose-dependent 
manner. In aggregate, the results demonstrate that DMHP effectively induces AA 
FLS apoptosis through caspase 3 activation and can be considered as a possible 
antirheumatic agent.
