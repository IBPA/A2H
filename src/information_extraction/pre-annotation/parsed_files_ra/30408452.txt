Anoectochilus roxburghii, a famous Chinese herbal medicine, has been commonly 
used for the treatment of liver disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. Our 
study aimed to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects of A. 
roxburghii polysaccharides (ARP), using the rat's model of type II 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). ARP was prepared by alcohol sedimentation and 
structurally characterized based on combined chemical, chromatographic and 
spectroscopic methods. High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle 
Laser Light Scattering-Refrative Index (HPSEC-MALLS-RI) analysis revealed that 
ARP includes two peaks, and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the 
principal one was estimated as 5.90 kDa with a relative content of 98.2%. 
Pharmacological results exhibited that ARP significantly decreased the arthritis 
index and ameliorated the inflammatory cell infiltration and the synovial tissue 
destruction in CIA rats. Additionally, ARP possessed significant NO production 
inhibitory effects and antioxidant activity. Further anti-inflammatory mechanism 
investigations indicated that ARP significantly inhibited the activation of 
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκB and 
p65, which subsequently down-regulated the mRNA expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 in 
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. These findings suggested that ARP has great 
potential in the development of functional foods and dietary supplements for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
