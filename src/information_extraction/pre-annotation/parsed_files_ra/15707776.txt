To find the antiinflammtory constituents of Acanthopanax chiisanensis 
(Araliaceae) leaves, phytochemical isolation procedures were performed by 
activity-guided fractionation in carrageenan- and Freund's complete adjuvant 
(FCA) reagent-induced rat models, respectively. In the two assay system, the 
MeOH extract (100 and 250 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant antiinflammtory 
effects. Since BuOH extract among the fractionated extracts exhibited the most 
potent effect, it was subjected to column chromatography to yield a main 
triterpene glycoside, chiisanoside (1). This compound was hydrolyzed in alkaline 
solution to find the biological activity of produced aglycone, chiisanogenin 
(1a). Oral treatment with compounds 1 and 1a produced significant 
antiinflammtory effects at 10 and 30 mg/kg dose, and 1a was more potent than 1. 
The antiiflammtory effects of the two compounds were supported by the reduction 
of carrageenan-induced lipid peroxidation and hydroxy radical in serum. 
Furthermore, treatment with 1 and 1a significantly reduced rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) factors in the rat induced by Freund's 
complete adjuvant reagent. Compounds, 1 and 1a, inhibited xanthine oxidase 
activity and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and 
catalase indicating that both compounds scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS).
