OBJECTIVE: SIRT1 modulates the acetylation of the p65 subunit of nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB) and plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory response. This 
study sought to assess the role of SIRT1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a 
myeloid cell-specific SIRT1 knockout (mSIRT1 KO) mouse.
METHODS: mSIRT1 KO mice were generated using the loxP/Cre recombinase system. 
K/BxN serum transfer arthritis was induced in mSIRT1 KO mice and age-matched 
littermate loxP control mice. Arthritis severity was assessed by clinical and 
pathological scoring. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and 
joints were measured by ELISA. Migration, M1 polarization, cytokine production, 
osteoclastogenesis, and p65 acetylation were assessed in bone marrow-derived 
monocytes/macrophages (BMMs).
RESULTS: mSIRT1 KO mice showed more severe inflammatory arthritis and aggravated 
pathological findings than control mice. These effects were paralleled by 
increases in IL-1, TNF-α, TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and F4/80⁺ macrophages in 
the ankles of mSIRT1 KO mice. In addition, BMMs from mSIRT1 KO mice displayed 
hyperacetylated p65 and increased NF-κB binding activity when compared to 
control mice, which resulted in increased M1 polarization, migration, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and osteoclastogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides in vivo evidence that myeloid cell-specific 
deletion of SIRT1 exacerbates inflammatory arthritis via the hyperactivation of 
NF-κB signaling, which suggests that SIRT1 activation may be beneficial in the 
treatment of inflammatory arthritis.
