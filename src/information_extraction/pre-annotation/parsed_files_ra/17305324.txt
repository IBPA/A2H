The synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a series of indole 
inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha, type IVA 
phospholipase) are described. Inhibitors of cPLA2alpha are predicted to be 
efficacious in treating asthma as well as the signs and symptoms of 
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and pain. The introduction of a benzyl 
sulfonamide substituent at C2 was found to impart improved potency of these 
inhibitors, and the SAR of these sulfonamide analogues is disclosed. Compound 
123 (Ecopladib) is a sub-micromolar inhibitor of cPLA2alpha in the GLU micelle 
and rat whole blood assays. Compound 123 displayed oral efficacy in the rat 
carrageenan air pouch and rat carrageenan-induced paw edema models.
