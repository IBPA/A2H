OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous arthritis in the KRN transgenic mouse (K/BxN) model is 
due to the autoreactivity of the transgenic T cell receptor and subsequent 
induction of autoantibodies directed against glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 
(G6PI). This study sought to analyze the potential of anti-CD40 ligand 
(anti-CD40L) and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) antibodies in 
preventing and treating arthritis in this murine model.
METHODS: Groups of K/BxN mice were injected with anti-CD40L and anti-TNFalpha 
antibodies during various stages of arthritis. Disease was assessed by clinical 
scoring, measurements of paw swelling, and histology. The results were 
correlated with the levels of autoantibodies in the serum, as assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Anti-CD40L antibody treatment was able to diminish significantly the 
arthritis development in K/BxN mice when given a week before the onset of 
clinically apparent disease. However, no effect on disease was seen when the 
antibodies were administered after clinical onset. Surprisingly, neutralizing 
anti-TNFalpha antibodies were unable to prevent arthritis in K/BxN mice. The 
success of antibody treatment in preventing disease correlated with low levels 
of anti-G6PI antibodies in the serum.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that anti-CD40L treatment can prevent 
arthritis development in a model of immunoglobulin-mediated arthritis, but 
anti-TNFalpha treatment cannot. The unsuccessful treatment of established 
disease was possibly due to the continued presence of autoreactive antibodies in 
the arthritic mice.
