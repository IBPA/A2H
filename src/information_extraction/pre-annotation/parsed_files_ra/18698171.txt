PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic lupus erythematosus etiology includes both genetic 
and environmental factors. Evidence suggests that many genetic loci in humans 
and mouse models contribute to the occurrence and clinical presentation of 
lupus. This large array of different genes affects many aspects of immune cell 
function, including the activation and functional differentiation of B cells, T 
cells, dendritic cells and other immune cells. In particular, the T-cell 
components that contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis are 
incompletely defined.
RECENT FINDINGS: A major paradigm shift in understanding how CD4+ T cells 
contribute to autoimmunity recently occurred with the discovery of a new T-cell 
population that produces the cytokine IL-17 (IL-17A), termed 'Th17'. Although 
Th17 cells contribute to autoimmune disease in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's 
disease, their role in systemic lupus erythematosus is far less clear.
SUMMARY: In this review, we focus on an emerging role for the cytokine IL-17 and 
the cells that produce it in contributing to lupus in particular based on recent 
findings in animal models.
