A characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis is the abundance of 
inflammatory cells in the diseased joint. Two major components of this 
infiltrate are neutrophils in the synovial fluid and macrophages in the synovial 
tissue. These cells produce cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and 
other proinflammatory mediators that likely drive the disease through its 
effector phases. To investigate what mechanisms underlie the recruitment of 
these cells into the synovial fluid and tissue, we performed expression analyses 
of chemoattractant receptors in a related family that includes the anaphylatoxin 
receptors and the formyl-MetLeuPhe receptor. We then examined the effect of 
targeted disruption of two abundantly expressed chemoattractant receptors, the 
receptors for C3a and C5a, on arthritogenesis in a mouse model of disease. We 
report that genetic ablation of C5a receptor expression completely protects mice 
from arthritis.
