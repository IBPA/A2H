We describe a copy-number variant (CNV) for which deletion alleles confer a 
protective affect against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This CNV reflects net unit 
deletions and expansions to a normal two-unit tandem duplication located on 
human chr12p13.31, a region with conserved synteny to the rat RA susceptibility 
quantitative trait loci Oia2. Genotyping, using the paralogue ratio test and SNP 
intensity data, in Swedish samples (2,403 cases, 1,269 controls) showed that the 
frequency of deletion variants is significantly lower in cases (P = 0.0012, 
OR = 0.442 [95%CI 0.258-0.755]). Reduced frequencies of deletion variants were 
also seen in replication materials comprising 9,201 UK samples (1,846 cases, 
7,355 controls) and 2,963 US samples (906 controls, 1,967 cases) 
(Mantel-Haenszel P = 0.036, OR = 0.559 [95%CI 0.323-0.966]). Combining the three 
datasets produces a Mantel-Haenszel OR of 0.497 (P < 0.0002). The deletion 
variant lacks 129-kb of DNA containing SLC2A3, NANOGP1, and SLC2A14. SLC2A3 
encodes a high-affinity glucose transporter important in the immune response and 
chondrocyte metabolism, both key aspects of RA pathogenesis. The large effect 
size of this association, its potential relevance to other diseases in which 
SLC2A3 is implicated, and the possibility of targeting drugs to inhibit SLC2A3, 
argue for further examination of the genetics and the biology of this CNV.
