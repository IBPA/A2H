Healthy synovial tissue includes a lining layer of synovial fibroblasts and 
macrophages. The influx of leucocytes during active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
includes monocytes that differentiate locally into proinflammatory macrophages, 
and these produce pathogenic tumour necrosis factor. During sustained remission, 
the synovial tissue macrophage numbers recede to normal. The constitutive 
presence of tissue macrophages in the lining layer of the synovial membrane in 
healthy donors and in patients with RA during remission suggests that this 
macrophage population may have a role in maintaining and reinstating synovial 
tissue homeostasis respectively. Recent appreciation of the different origins 
and functions of tissue-resident compared with monocyte-derived macrophages has 
improved the understanding of their relative involvement in organ homeostasis in 
mouse models of disease. In this review, informed by mouse models and human 
data, we describe the presence of different functional subpopulations of human 
synovial tissue macrophages and discuss their distinct contribution to joint 
homeostasis and chronic inflammation in RA.
