Glorisa superba (GS) is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in 
the treatment of joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was 
carried out to investigate the antiarthritic activity of Glorisa superba 
hydroalcoholic extract (GSHE) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. 
Arthritis was induced by sub-plantar administration of complete Freund's 
adjuvant (CFA) and GSHE (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 
21 consecutive days. Joint diameter was measured on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. 
GSHE dose dependently attenuates the increased joint diameter and serum tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α level following induction of arthritis by adjuvant. This 
attenuation was well substantiated with reduced mRNA expression of interleukin 
(IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB. Additionally, GSHE inhibited phosphorylation of 
the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway as there was 
decreased protein expression of MAPK (p-p38/p38 and p-ERK/ERK p-JNK/JNK ratio). 
Moreover, GSHE in a dose-dependent fashion normalized the redox status of ankle 
joint (GSH, malonaldialdehyde [MDA], and NO levels and superoxide dismutase 
[SOD] and catalase [CAT] activities) and displayed decreased inflammatory cell 
infiltration in histopathological findings. Taken together, these findings 
indicate that GSHE protects against AIA by modulating MAPK.
