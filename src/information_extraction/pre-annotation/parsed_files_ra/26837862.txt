Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) 2 vector gene therapy offers promise 
for the healing of Rheumatoid arthritis. To support the clinical development of 
the candidate gene therapeutic product in China, a comprehensive preclinical 
safety assessment of rAAV2 encoding human TNF receptor-immunoglobulin Fc fusion 
gene (rAAV2/human TNFR:Fc), were conducted in 3 species of experimental animals. 
No abnormal findings were observed in mice following single intravenous 
administration with test article. Compared with the control group, no 
differences in mean body weight, food consumption in rats and monkeys following 
the repeated intraarticular administration with rAAV2/human TNFR:Fc. There were 
also no significant adverse effects due to treatment noted by clinical 
chemistry, hematology and pathology assessments. After intraarticular 
administration with rAAV2/human TNFR:Fc, the vector DNA initially distributed to 
spleen, lymph nodes, and joint synovium. The vector DNA cleared rapidly as it 
could be detected mainly at the site of injection by 91 d post-administration 
(182 d for monkey). Taken together, localized delivery of rAAV2/human TNFR:Fc 
showed no significant toxicity in mice, rats, and monkeys, which support the 
planned clinical evaluation of this product.
