OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of bizhongxiao decoction (BZXD) which is 
a Traditional Chinese medicine for RA including, on the plasma TNF-α and IL-1β 
in rats with CII-induced arthritis (CIA) and explore the protective mechanism of 
BZXD in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: 75 SD rats were divided into four groups randomly. Normal control group 
(n=5) not be treated any more. The CIA rat was established by subcutaneous 
injection with bovine II collagen (B II C) and complete Freund, s adjuvant (CFA) 
after 7d breeding. The CIA rats were divided into the CIA group (n=16), BZXD 
group (n=29) treated with BZXD and the MTX group (n=25) treated with 
methotrexate. All rats were killed after various intervals (25, 30, 35, 40, or 
45d). At the end of each time interval, we collected the blood of each rat. To 
detect TNF-α and IL-1β in plasma with radio-immunity kit.
RESULTS: BIIC and CFA can be used to copying CIA model. The incidence of 
arthritis was 88%. The plasma TNF-α and IL-1β levels of CIA group, BZXD group 
and MTX group were notably higher than those of normal control group (p<0.05), 
moreover, the CIA group was higher than those of the MTX group and BZXD group at 
various interval (p<0.01). TNF-α and IL-1β rose step by step in CIA group but 
decreased in BZXD group and MTX group gradually. Moreover, in BZXD group were 
lower than those in MTX group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: TNF-α and IL-1β play a very important role in the formation and 
development of RA. BZXD can notably decrease the plasma TNF-α and IL-1β levels, 
which was better than MTX.
