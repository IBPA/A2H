Resolving the genetic basis of complex diseases like rheumatoid arthritis will 
require knowledge of the corresponding diseases in experimental animals to 
enable translational functional studies. Mapping of quantitative trait loci in 
mouse models of arthritis, such as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), using F(2) 
crosses has been successful, but can resolve loci only to large chromosomal 
regions. Using an inbred-outbred cross design, we identified and fine-mapped CIA 
loci on a genome-wide scale. Heterogeneous stock mice were first intercrossed 
with an inbred strain, B10.Q, to introduce an arthritis permitting MHCII 
haplotype. Homozygous H2(q) mice were then selected to set up an F(3) generation 
with fixed major histocompatibility complex that was used for arthritis 
experiments. We identified 26 loci, 18 of which are novel, controlling arthritis 
traits such as incidence of disease, severity and time of onset and fine-mapped 
a number of previously mapped loci.
