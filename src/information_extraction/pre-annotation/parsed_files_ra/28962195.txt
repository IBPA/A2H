Over the past 40 years, the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) animal model has 
been widely used as a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, no model is 
able to completely depict the characteristics of cartilage destruction to date. 
In the later stage of joint cartilage destruction, bony spurs form in RA. This 
bony spur formation is an important symptom in the pathological development of 
RA. In the present study, CIA was used to elucidate the pathological process of 
bony spur formation. Joint damage and spur formation in the animal model was 
detected by radiology and histology. Radiology identified bony spurs in the knee 
and foot joints, which worsened as the disease progressed. Furthermore, 
following observations of histological sections, fusion and damage of the 
articular cartilage, as well as a higher number of osteoclasts, were identified. 
Previous results have determined that bony spurs may be involved in another 
pathological process that occurs during the later stages of RA. Therefore, 
further studies investigating this symptom are required to improve the 
understanding of RA and facilitate the development of an appropriate treatment 
for RA.
