The pathogenicity of multiple sclerosis is still poorly understood, but 
identification of susceptibility genes using the animal model experimental 
allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) could provide leads. Certain genes may be 
shared between different autoimmune diseases, and identification of such genes 
is of obvious importance. To locate gene regions involved in the control of EAE 
and to compare the findings with the susceptibility loci recently identified in 
a model for rheumatoid arthritis (pristane-induced arthritis), we made crosses 
between the encephalomyelitis- and arthritis-susceptible rat strain DA and the 
resistant E3 strain. Genetic analysis of animals produced in a F2 intercross 
identified 11 loci associated with specific EAE-associated traits. 
Interestingly, five of these loci were situated at the same position as major 
loci controlling pristane-induced arthritis and showed similarities in 
inheritance pattern and subphenotype associations. Our results show that 
different phases of EAE are controlled by different sets of genes and that 
common genes are likely to be involved in different autoimmune diseases.
