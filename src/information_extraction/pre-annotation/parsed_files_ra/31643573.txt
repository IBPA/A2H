Rituximab is a chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody to CD20 a cell surface 
antigen found on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes and which is approved for use in 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as in several 
autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and Wegener granulomatous. 
Rituximab has been linked to many cases of severe and even fatal liver injury as 
a result of reactivation of inactive or previously resolved hepatitis B.
