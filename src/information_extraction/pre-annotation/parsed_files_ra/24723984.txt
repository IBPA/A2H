We have synthesized a targeted imaging agent for rheumatoid arthritis based on 
polysulfated gold nanorods. The CTAB layer on gold nanorods was first replaced 
with PEG-thiol and then with dendritic polyglycerolsulfate at elevated 
temperature, which resulted in significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to 
polyanionic gold nanorods functionalized by non-covalent approaches. In addition 
to classical characterization methods, we have established a facile UV-VIS based 
BaCl2 agglomeration assay to confirm a quantitative removal of unbound ligand. 
With the help of a competitive surface plasmon resonance-based L-selectin 
binding assay and a leukocyte adhesion-based flow cell assay, we have 
demonstrated the high inflammation targeting potential of the synthesized gold 
nanorods in vitro. In combination with the surface plasmon resonance band of 
AuNRs at 780 nm, these findings permitted the imaging of inflammation in an in 
vivo mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis with high contrast using multispectral 
optoacoustic tomography. The study offers a robust method for otherwise 
difficult to obtain covalently functionalized polyanionic gold nanorods, which 
are suitable for biological applications as well as a low-cost, actively 
targeted, and high contrast imaging agent for the diagnosis of rheumatoid 
arthritis. This paves the way for further research in other inflammation 
associated pathologies, in particular, when photothermal therapy can be applied.
