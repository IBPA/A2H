Superoxide anion (O(2) (•-)) is overproduced in joint inflammation, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Increased O(2) (•-) production leads to tissue 
damage, articular degeneration, and pain. In these conditions, the physiological 
defense against O(2) (•-), superoxide dismutases (SOD) are decreased. The Mn(II) 
complex MnL4 is a potent SOD mimetic, and in this study it was tested in 
inflammatory and osteoarticular rat pain models. In vivo protocols were approved 
by the animal Ethical Committee of the University of Florence. Pain was measured 
by paw pressure and hind limb weight bearing alterations tests. MnL4 (15 
mg kg(-1)) acutely administered, significantly reduced pain induced by 
carrageenan, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA). 
In CFA and MIA protocols, it ameliorated the alteration of postural equilibrium. 
When administered by osmotic pump in the MIA osteoarthritis, MnL4 reduced pain, 
articular derangement, plasma TNF alpha levels, and protein carbonylation. The 
scaffold ring was ineffective. MnL4 (10(-7) M) prevented the lipid peroxidation 
of isolated human chondrocytes when O(2) (•-) was produced by RAW 264.7. MnL4 
behaves as a potent pain reliever in acute inflammatory and chronic articular 
pain, being its efficacy related to antioxidant property. Therefore MnL4 appears 
as a novel protective compound potentially suitable for the treatment of joint 
diseases.
