The primary aim of the study was to describe and correlate pain behavior and 
changes in bone morphology in animal models of arthritis both in rats and guinea 
pigs. Either complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or mono-iodoacetate (MIA) solution 
was injected into the left knee joint to obtain a model for rheumatoid arthritis 
and osteoarthritis, respectively. Subsequently, animals were behaviorally tested 
during a period of 12 days after CFA injection and at least 19 days after MIA 
injection. During these observation periods increasing pain behavior was 
observed, characterized by decreased von Frey mechanical thresholds and weight 
bearing on the affected limb. In Hargreaves' paw flick test slightly increased 
thermal hypersensitivity was observed in some instances in guinea pigs. In rats 
there was also decreased limb-use during forced ambulation. To evaluate bone 
destruction mu-computed tomography scans of the arthritic knee were taken on the 
last experimental day. Different bone parameters indicative of osteolysis and 
decreased trabecular connectivity were significantly correlated with the 
observed pain behavior. Detailed description of morphological changes in 
arthritic joints better characterizes the different animal models and might add 
to the knowledge on the working mechanisms of analgesic compounds that have an 
influence on bone structures in arthritis.
