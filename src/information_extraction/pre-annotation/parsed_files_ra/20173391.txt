TNF-alpha (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine which can have proinflammatory or 
immunosuppressive effects, depending on the context, duration of exposure and 
disease state. The basis for the opposing actions of TNF remains elusive. The 
growing appreciation of CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which comprise 
approximately 10% of peripheral CD4 cells, as pivotal regulators of immune 
responses has provided a new framework to define the cellular and molecular 
basis underlying the contrasting action of TNF. TNF by itself can overcome the 
profound anergic state of T cell receptor-stimulated Tregs. Furthermore, in 
concert with IL-2, TNF selectively activates Tregs, resulting in proliferation, 
upregulation of FoxP3 expression and increases in their suppressive activity. 
Both human and mouse Tregs predominantly express TNFR2, making it possible for 
TNF to enhance Treg activity, which helps limit the collateral damage caused by 
excessive immune responses and eventually terminates immune response. 
TNFR2-expressing CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs comprise approximately 40% of peripheral Tregs 
in normal mice and present the maximally suppressive subset of Tregs. In this 
review, studies describing the action of TNF on Treg function will be discussed. 
The role of Tregs in the autoimmune disorders and cancer as well as the effect 
of anti-TNF therapy on Tregs, especially in rheumatoid arthritis, will also be 
considered.
