In rheumatoid synovial tissues, synovial fibroblasts are activated by 
proinflammatory cytokines and proliferate to develop hyperplastic pannus 
tissues, which irreversibly damage the affected joints. We recently reported 
that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(INK4a) and p21(Cip1) are not 
expressed in vivo in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, but are readily inducible 
in vitro. This observation was followed by the successful treatment of rat 
adjuvant arthritis by local p16(INK4a) gene transfer, showing that the 
inhibition of the cell cycle of the synovial cells ameliorates the arthritis. In 
this study, we show that another animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, murine 
collagen-induced arthritis, can be effectively treated by local gene transfer of 
p21(Cip1) as well as that of p16(INK4a). The anti-arthritic effects were 
observed even when the treatment was conducted after the arthritis had 
developed. Furthermore, the effects included suppression of the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ss, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Our results 
demonstrate that the ectopic expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 
not only prevents synovial overgrowth but also ameliorates the proinflammatory 
milieu in the affected joints. The induction of p21(Cip1) in rheumatoid synovial 
tissues by pharmacological agents may also be an effective strategy to treat 
rheumatoid arthritis.
