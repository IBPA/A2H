Rat models are useful for studies of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) since rats are extraordinarily sensitive to induction of arthritis with 
adjuvants. Injection of not only the classical complete Freund's adjuvant but 
also mineral oil without mycobacteria and pure adjuvants such as pristane and 
squalene, induce severe arthritis in many rat strains. Models like 
pristane-induced arthritis in rats are optimal models for RA since they fulfill 
the RA criteria including a chronic relapsing disease course. Arthritogenic 
adjuvants like pristane, avridine, squalene and mineral oil are not immunogenic 
since they do not contain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding 
peptides. Nevertheless, the diseases are MHC-associated and dependent on the 
activation of alphabetaTCR (T-cell receptor)-expressing T cells. However, it has 
not been possible to link the immune response to joint antigens or other 
endogenous components although immunization with various cartilage proteins 
induce arthritis but with different pathogeneses. To unravel the mechanisms 
behind adjuvant-induced arthritis, a disease-oriented genetic approach is 
optimal. Several loci that control onset of arthritis, severity and chronicity 
of the disease have been identified in genetic crosses and most of these have 
been confirmed in congenic strains. In addition, many of these loci are found in 
other autoimmune models in the rat as well as associated with arthritis in mice 
and humans.
