BACKGROUND: Receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) is expressed as either 
surface (hRANKL1, hRANKL2) or soluble (hRANKL3) form. RANKL is involved in 
multifaceted processes of immunoregulation and bone resorption such as they 
occur in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interestingly, activated basophils, which 
are effector cells in allergic inflammation, contribute to the progress of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for RA. Here, we investigate 
under which conditions human basophils express RANKL.
METHODS: Among other stimuli, basophils were cultured with IL-3 alone. 
Alternatively, as a secondary stimulus, IgER-dependent or IgER-independent 
agents were added simultaneously either with IL-3 or after prolonged IL-3 
culturing. Expression of RANKL protein and mRNA was analyzed by flow cytometry, 
ELISA, and real-time PCR. A coculture system was applied to investigate 
biological activity of basophil-derived RANKL.
RESULTS: We show that in human basophils, IL-3 but no other stimulus induces de 
novo expression of soluble and surface RANKL, of which the latter enhances 
survival of MoDC. Upon simultaneous stimulation, IgER cross-linking reduces 
surface RANKL expression, while IgER-independent stimuli have no effect. This is 
in contrast to consecutive stimulation, as triggering with both IgER-dependent 
and IgER-independent stimuli enhances RANKL expression, particularly in its 
soluble form. Real-time PCR analysis shows that RANKL expression is mainly 
regulated at the mRNA level.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies IL-3 as a potent inducer of RANKL expression 
in human basophils, suggesting them to interact with bone physiology and 
activation of immune cells. IgER-dependent and IgER-independent stimuli modulate 
the IL-3-mediated RANKL expression in a time- and stimulus-dependent fashion.
