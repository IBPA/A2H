TNF-α siRNA has shown promising therapeutic benefits in animal models of 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, there continues to be a need for siRNA delivery 
systems that have high siRNA encapsulation efficiency and minimum burst release 
of TNF-α siRNA, and can target inflamed tissues after intravenous 
administration. Herein we report a novel acid-sensitive sheddable PEGylated 
solid-lipid nanoparticle formulation of TNF-α-siRNA, AS-TNF-α-siRNA-SLNs, 
prepared by incorporating lipophilized TNF-α-siRNA into solid-lipid 
nanoparticles composed of biocompatible lipids such as lecithin and cholesterol. 
The nanoparticles are approximately 120 nm in diameter, have a high siRNA 
encapsulation efficiency (>90%) and a minimum burst release of siRNA (<5%), and 
increase the deilvery of the siRNA in chronic inflammation sites in mouse 
models, including in a mouse model with collagen-induced arthritis. Importantly, 
in a mouse model of collagen antibody-induced arthritis that does not respond to 
methotrexate therapy, intravenous injection of the AS-TNF-α-siRNA-SLNs 
significantly reduced paw thickness, bone loss, and histopathological scores. 
These findings highlight the potential of using this novel siRNA nanoparticle 
formulation to effectively treat arthritis, potentially in patients who do not 
respond adequately to methotrexate.
