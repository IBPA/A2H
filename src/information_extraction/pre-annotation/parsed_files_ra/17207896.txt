Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis can modulate 
the immune system. Cytokines and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are potent regulators of 
the HPA axis and are both produced by the adrenal medulla. The cytokine 
interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) belongs to the interleukin-1 family along with 
interleukin-1alpha and the interleukin receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The aim of 
the present study was to determine the interaction between NPY and IL-1beta in 
catecholamine (norepinephrine, NE and epinephrine, EP) release from mouse 
chromaffin cells in culture. We found that IL-1beta increased the constitutive 
release of NPY, NE and EP from mouse chromaffin cells. This IL-1beta stimulatory 
effect was blocked by IL-1ra. The immunoneutralization of NPY and the use of the 
NPY Y(1) receptor antagonist (BIBP 3226) inhibited the stimulatory effect of 
IL-1beta on catecholamine release from these cells. The present work shows that 
IL-1beta induces catecholamine release, and in turn this peptide will induce an 
additional increase in catecholamine release acting through the Y(1) receptor. 
This work suggests that NPY is involved in the regulatory loop between the 
immune and the adrenal system in some pathophysiological conditions where 
plasmatic IL-1beta increases, like in sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, stress or 
hypertension.
