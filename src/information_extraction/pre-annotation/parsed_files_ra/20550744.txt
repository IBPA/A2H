Cocoa polyphenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. TNF-α is a 
pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a vital role in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory diseases such as cancer and psoriasis. Vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) expression is associated with tumorigenesis, CVD, rheumatoid 
arthritis and psoriasis. We tested whether cocoa polyphenol extract (CPE) 
inhibited TNF-α-induced VEGF expression in promotion-sensitive JB6 mouse 
epidermal cells. CPE significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced up-regulation of VEGF 
via reducing TNF-α-induced activation of the nuclear transcription factors 
activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, which are key regulators of VEGF 
expression. CPE also inhibited TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B 
(Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. CPE blocked activation of their 
downstream kinases, p70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase and p90 kDa ribosomal 
protein S6 kinase. CPE suppressed phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity via 
binding PI3K directly. CPE did not affect TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) but suppressed TNF-α-induced 
MEK1 activity. Collectively, these results indicate that CPE reduced 
TNF-α-induced up-regulation of VEGF by directly inhibiting PI3K and MEK1 
activities, which may contribute to its chemopreventive potential.
