Auranofin, a disease-modifying gold compound, has been empirically applying to 
the management of rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated a protective effect of 
auranofin against hepatic injury induced by cocaine. Cocaine (75 mg/kg) markedly 
increased serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) (4,130 IU/l) and aspartate amino 
transferase (AST) (1,730 IU/l) activities at 16 hr after treatment, and induced 
hepatic necrosis surrounding central veins in mice. Concurrently, overexpression 
of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a rate-limiting enzyme for heme degradation and an 
oxidative stress marker, was identified at the edges of cocaine-mediated 
necrotic area. Auranofin (10 mg/ml, i.p.) significantly induced hepatic HO-1 
protein in mice from 12 hr after treatment. Interestingly, pretreatment with 
auranofin resulted in the prevention of the increase of serum ALT and AST 
activities in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, although cocaine 
increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) gene expression in mouse livers, 
cocaine-induced liver injury was observed in TNFα deficient mice as well as 
wild-type mice. Auranofin-inducted HO-1 gene expression was observed in human 
primary hepatocytes as well as mouse primary hepatocytes. The present findings 
suggest that auranofin is effective in preventing cocaine-induced hepatic 
injury, and HO-1 may contribute to protect against chemically-induced 
cytotoxicity.
