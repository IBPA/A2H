The preventive and therapeutic effects of the Citrus flavonoid hesperidin (HES) 
on the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were investigated. Mice were administered orally HES 
three times a week starting from either the onset (day 21) of secondary 
immunization or on day 31, when the CIA development had reached a plateau. In 
both cases, treatment with HES resulted in a significant suppression of clinical 
scores and improvement of histological features. These results suggest that oral 
administration of HES could be effective for treating human RA patients.
