Aberrant regulation of T helper (Th) cell maturation is associated with a number 
of autoimmune conditions, including allergic disorders and rheumatoid arthritis. 
The Src homology domain protein B (Shb) adaptor protein was recently implicated 
as a regulator of Th cell differentiation. Shb is an integral component of the 
T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling complex and in the absence of Shb the TCR is 
less responsive to stimulation, resulting in the preferential development of Th2 
responses under conditions of in vitro stimulation. In the present study, we 
extend those observations to an in vivo situation using a murine model of atopic 
dermatitis. Shb knockout mice develop more pronounced symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis with increased localized oedema, epidermal hyperplasia and IgE 
production. Dermal infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils, CD4(+) Th cells and 
F4/80(+) macrophages was also significantly increased in Shb-deficient mice. 
This correlated with elevated transcription of the hallmark Th2 cytokines 
interleukin-4 and interleukin-5. The loss of Shb therefore alters TCR signalling 
ability, thereby favouring the development of Th2-driven inflammation and 
exacerbating symptoms of allergy.
