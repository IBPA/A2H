Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious autoimmune disease caused by chronic 
inflammation of connective tissues. The basic principle of RA treatment is aimed 
to reduce joint inflammation. Our previous studies demonstrated that salmon 
cartilage proteoglycan (PG) suppresses excess inflammation in different mouse 
inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the prophylactic effect of 
PG on the progression of RA using an experimental mouse model, collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). Clinical and histological severity of CIA was attenuated by 
daily oral administration of PG. In the joints of PG-administered mice, 
infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and also osteoclast accumulation 
were limited. In comparison to nonadministered mice, anti-collagen antibodies in 
the sera of PG-administered mice did not alter. On the other hand, local 
expression of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-6, IL-1 β, interferon- γ (IFN- γ), 
C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and CXCL2 in 
the joints of PG-administered mice decreased. Moreover, in the response of type 
II collagen- (CII-) restimulation ex vivo, IL-17A and IFN- γ production by 
splenocytes from PG-administered mice was less than that of control mice. These 
data suggested that daily ingested PG attenuated CIA pathogenesis by modulating 
immune response of splenocytes to CII stimulation and local production 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the joints.
