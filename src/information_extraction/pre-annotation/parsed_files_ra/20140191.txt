Etanercept, a TNF receptor 2-Fc fusion protein, is currently being used for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, 25% to 38% of patients show no 
response which is suspected to be partially due to insufficient affinity of this 
protein to TNFalpha. By using computational protein design, we found that 
residue W89 and E92 of TNFR2 were critical for ligand binding. Among several 
mutants tested, W89Y/E92N displayed 1.49-fold higher neutralizing activity to 
TNFalpha, as compared to that of Etanercept. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
based binding assay revealed that the equilibrium dissociation constant of 
W89Y/E92N to TNFalpha was 3.65-fold higher than that of Etanercept. In a rat 
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), W89Y/E92N showed a significantly 
better ability than Etanercept in reducing paw swelling and improvement of 
arthritic joint histopathologically. These data demonstrate that W89Y/E92N is 
potentially a better candidate with improved efficacy in treating RA and other 
autoimmune diseases.
