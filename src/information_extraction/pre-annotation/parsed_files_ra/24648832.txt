Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management has greatly improved with the development 
of biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, but a proportion of patients 
do not improve despite the biologic drugs currently available. We need new 
biologic agents with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of refractory 
patients. Recent evidence has shown that granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is involved in the pathogenesis of RA. GM-CSF 
can exacerbate RA and elevated levels of this cytokine have been observed in 
synovial fluid from RA patients. Antagonism of GM-CSF can strikingly reduce 
established disease in mouse models of arthritis. Mavrilimumab, a human 
monoclonal antibody to GM-CSF receptor Î±, is a competitive antagonist of GM-CSF 
signaling. Phase I and II studies have shown good clinical response with a good 
safety profile in patients with mild to moderate RA, suggesting encouraging 
effects of mavrilimumab for the treatment of RA. This paper reviews the 
preclinical and clinical data evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of mavrilimumab in the treatment of RA.
