AIM: To develop and characterize an RGD peptide functionalized 
poly(lactide-co-glycolytic) acid (PLGA) nanosystem to deliver a STAT1 siRNA to 
joint tissues in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: RGD-PLGA polymer was synthesized and used in preparing functionalized 
nanoparticles loaded with either tracking material or siRNA. The properties of 
the nanoparticles and stability of siRNA after encapsulation was assessed. 
Nanoparticle distribution was determined both noninvasively and based on 
analysis of dissected organs from arthritic and healthy mice. Arthritic mice 
were treated with weekly doses of STAT1 siRNA-loaded nanoparticles or controls. 
Clinical disease was assessed. Paws of arthritic mice were sectioned for 
histology or processed for RNA. STAT1, Mrc-1, and IL-10 mRNA abundance was 
determined by quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Nanoparticles protected the siRNA from serum degradation. The presence 
of RGD peptide on the nanoparticles increased paw tissue uptake in arthritic 
mice. Furthermore, RGD functionalization increased lung delivery of 
nanoparticles in arthritic mice but not in control mice. Disease regressed in 
the STAT1 siRNA-treated animals and progressed in all control groups. STAT1 mRNA 
levels were decreased in paws of treated animals, while Mrc-1 and IL-10 mRNA 
levels were increased.
CONCLUSION: RGD functionalized PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating STAT1-targeted 
siRNAs are efficacious in the treatment of established arthritis, possibly 
through a selective inhibition of macrophage and dendritic cell activation.
