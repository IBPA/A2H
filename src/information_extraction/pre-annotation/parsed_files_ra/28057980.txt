Periploca forrestii Schltr. has been used as a Chinese folk medicine due to its 
versatile pharmacological effects such as promoting wounds and rheumatoid 
arthritis. However, the antiarthritic activity of Periploca forrestii saponin 
(PFS) and its active compound Periplocin has still not been demonstrated. Here, 
we evaluated the antiarthritic effects of PFS in adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(AIA) rats by intragastric administration at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The 
anti-inflammatory activities of Periplocin were also examined in LPS-induced AIA 
splenocytes and synoviocytes. PFS significantly ameliorated joint swelling; 
inhibited bone erosion in joints; lowered levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in AIA rat 
splenocyte; and reduced joint protein expression levels of phospho-STAT3 and 
IKKα. Using LPS-induced AIA splenocytes, we demonstrate that Periplocin 
suppressed the key proinflammatory cytokines levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, and 
IL-13 and IL-22 and transcription factor levels of T-bet, GATA3, and C-Jun 
genes. Periplocin also suppressed LPS-induced cytokine secretion from 
synoviocytes. Our study highlights the antiarthritic activity of PFS and its 
derived Periplocin and the underlying mechanisms. These results provide a strong 
rationale for further testing and validation of the use of Periploca forrestii 
Schltr. as an alternative modality for the treatment of RA.
