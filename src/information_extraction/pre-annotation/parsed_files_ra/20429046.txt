INTRODUCTION: CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule believed to play a critical role 
in T cell and monocyte infiltration in the inflammatory process. The reduction 
of CD44 expression or its ability to properly interact with its key ligand, 
hyaluronic acid (HA), inhibits migration and subsequent activation of cells 
within sites of inflammation. CD44-deficient mice exhibit decreased disease in a 
mouse arthritis model.
METHODS: Accordingly, we developed PF-03475952, a fully human IgG2 anti-CD44 
monoclonal antibody (mAb).
RESULTS: Binding of PF-03475952 to CD44 inhibits binding of HA and induces loss 
of CD44 from the cell surface. PF-03475952 also passed a series of safety 
pharmacology assays designed to assess the risk of the mAb to bind Fc gamma 
receptors, stimulate cytokine release from human whole blood, and stimulate 
cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using 
plate-bound antibodies. The latter assay was designed specifically to evaluate 
the risk of cytokine storm that had been observed with TGN1412 
(immunostimulatory CD28 superagonist mAb). PF-003475952 exhibits high-affinity 
binding to both human and cynomolgus monkey CD44, but does not cross-react with 
rodent CD44. Thus, a rat anti-mouse CD44 mAb was used to demonstrate a 
dose-dependent decrease of disease in mouse collagen-induced arthritis. 
Importantly, efficacy was correlated with >50% loss of cell surface CD44 on 
circulating cells. Loss of CD44 expression on CD3+ lymphocytes was monitored 
following a single dose of PF-03475952 in cynomolgus monkeys as a 
pharmacodynamic marker. The recovery of CD44 expression was found to be 
dose-dependent. PF-03475952 doses of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg reduced CD44 
expression below 50% for 218, 373, and >504 hours, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Targeting of CD44 is a unique mechanism of action in the treatment 
of inflammatory diseases and is expected to reduce joint damage induced by 
inflammatory mediators, resulting in disease modification in inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
