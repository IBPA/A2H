Methotrexate is the first line of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Since many 
patients become unresponsive to methotrexate treatment, only very expensive 
biological therapies are effective and increased methotrexate tolerance 
strategies need to be identified. Here we propose the encapsulation of 
methotrexate in a new liposomal formulation using a hydrophobic fragment of 
surfactant protein conjugated to a linker and folate to enhance their tolerance 
and efficacy. In this study we aim to evaluate the efficiency of this system to 
treat rheumatoid arthritis, by targeting folate receptor β present at the 
surface of activated macrophages, key effector cells in this pathology. The 
specificity of our liposomal formulation to target folate receptor β was 
investigated both in vitro as in vivo using a mouse model of arthritis 
(collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice strain). In both systems, the 
liposomal constructs were shown to be highly specific and efficient in targeting 
folate receptor β. These liposomal formulations also significantly increase the 
clinical benefit of the encapsulated methotrexate in vivo in arthritic mice, 
together with reduced expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases by 
joint-infiltrating macrophages. Thus, our formulation might be a promising cost 
effective way to treat rheumatoid arthritis and delay or reduce methotrexate 
intolerance.
