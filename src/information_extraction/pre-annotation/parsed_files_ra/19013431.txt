Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be associated with increased risks of 
hypoxia-related diseases, whose progresses are critically determined by 
HIF-1alpha. The authors hypothesized that the hypoxia-related complications of 
RA are associated with HIF-1alpha deregulation by some factor(s) in RA serum. 
Arthritis was induced in female Lewis rats by injecting complete Freund's 
adjuvant. The effects of arthritic rat serum (ARS) on hypoxic responses were 
investigated by incubating Hep3B cells in ARS. In the presence of ARS, 
HIF-1alpha was down-regulated and inactivated under hypoxic conditions. ARS 
inactivated AKT and mTOR, which led to impaired HIF-1alpha protein synthesis. 
Furthermore, insulin was found to be deficient in ARS and insulin 
supplementation fully recovered HIF-1alpha synthesis with AKT and mTOR 
activation. These results suggest that HIF-1alpha deregulation by components in 
serum is responsible for the RA-associated aggravation of hypoxic diseases in 
extra-articular tissues.
