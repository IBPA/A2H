Dendrimers are nanosized hyperbranched polymers synthesized through an iterative 
step-by-step process; their size and structure are perfectly controlled, and 
they are widely used for biomedical purposes. Previously, we showed that a 
phosphorous-based dendrimer capped with anionic AzaBisPhosphonate groups 
(so-called ABP dendrimer) has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties 
toward the human immune system. It dramatically inhibits the onset and 
development of experimental arthritis in a mouse model relevant for human 
rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease of auto-immune origin. In 
this article, we demonstrate in an unprecedented study that cynomolgus macaques 
repeatedly injected with the ABP dendrimer displayed no adverse response. 
Indeed, biochemical, haematological, clotting and immunological parameters 
remained with a normal physiological range during the study. Moreover, 
quantification of serum cytokines and histopathological analyses failed to 
reveal any noticeable lesion or noteworthy non-physiological occurrence. These 
results strengthen the potential of the ABP dendrimer as an innovative 
drug-candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and favor the 
regulatory preclinical development of the molecule.
