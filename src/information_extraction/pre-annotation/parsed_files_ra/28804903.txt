Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) are a promising therapeutic tool to restore 
immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The rationale of using tolDCs is that 
they can specifically target the pathogenic T-cell response while leaving other, 
protective, T-cell responses intact. Several ways of generating therapeutic 
tolDCs have been described, but whether these tolDCs should be loaded with 
autoantigen(s), and if so, with which autoantigen(s), remains unclear. 
Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are not commonly defined by a 
single, universal, autoantigen. A possible solution is to use surrogate 
autoantigens for loading of tolDCs. We propose that heat-shock proteins may be a 
relevant surrogate antigen, as they are evolutionarily conserved between 
species, ubiquitously expressed in inflamed tissues and have been shown to 
induce regulatory T cells, ameliorating disease in various arthritis mouse 
models. In this review, we provide an overview on how immune tolerance may be 
restored by tolDCs, the problem of selecting relevant autoantigens for loading 
of tolDCs, and why heat-shock proteins could be used as surrogate autoantigens.
