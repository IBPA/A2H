OBJECTIVE: Chemokine receptors mediate leukocyte migration into inflamed 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue (ST). Knowledge of their distribution 
is crucial for understanding the evolution of the inflammatory process. In this 
study, we used rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), a model for RA, to define 
the temporospatial expression of chemokine receptors.
METHODS: ST from rats with AIA was immunostained, the percentage of cells 
expressing each receptor was determined, and findings were correlated with 
levels of inflammation. Chemokine receptor expression was evaluated on rat 
macrophages in vitro.
RESULTS: CCR1, a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha 
(MIP-1alpha)/CCL3 and RANTES/CCL5, exhibited high constitutive expression on 
macrophages in AIA. CCR5, binding MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and RANTES/CCL5, was 
up-regulated on ST macrophages during the course of AIA, correlating with 
macrophage expression of CCR2, a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein 
1/CCL2. Endothelial cell (EC) CCR2 was down-regulated as arthritis progressed, 
inversely correlating with inflammation. CCR3, another RANTES/CCL5 receptor, was 
constitutively high on macrophages in vivo and in vitro, with down-regulation 
during AIA. CXCR4, a receptor for stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCL12), was 
prominently up-regulated on ECs, preceding the peak of inflammation.
CONCLUSION: These findings show that 1) constitutive expression of CCR1 on 
macrophages remains high during AIA; 2) CCR2 and CCR3 may play a role in initial 
recruitment of leukocytes to ST in AIA; 3) macrophage expression of CCR2 and 
CCR5 may be important for sustaining inflammatory changes; and 4) EC CXCR4 may 
be a harbinger of inflammatory changes. Our results may help guide chemokine 
receptor blockade-targeting treatment strategies in inflammatory arthritis.
