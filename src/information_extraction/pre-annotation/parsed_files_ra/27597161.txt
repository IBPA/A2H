Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) is an inner mitochondrial membrane 
enzyme that involves in the fourth step of the biosynthesis of pyrimidine base. 
Inhibitors of hDHODH have been proven efficacy for the treatments of 
inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and cancer. In the 
present study, ascochlorin (ASC) and its derivatives, natural compounds from 
fungal metabolites, were discovered as hDHODH inhibitors by high-throughput 
screening. Enzyme kinetics studies showed that ASC competitively binds to hDHODH 
at the site of coenzyme Q substrate. In ex vivo study, ASC significantly 
inhibited the ConA-stimulated T lymphocytes proliferation and interleukin-2, 
interferon-Î³ production. Furthermore, ASC showed significant in vivo 
anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects on the mice ears swelling, 
allogenic skin grafts and rat collagen-induced arthritis animal disease models. 
ASC significantly reduced ears edema level of mice, increased the survival time 
of allogenic skin implanted on the mice and attenuated arthritis severity of rat 
model. In conclusion, ASC was identified as a new structural class of hDHODH 
inhibitors with efficient anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive activity, and may 
be a promising candidate for the development of new therapy in the treatment of 
autoimmune diseases.
