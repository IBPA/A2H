G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are implicated in the pathophysiology 
of human diseases such as arterial hypertension, heart failure and rheumatoid 
arthritis. While G-protein-coupled receptor kinases 2 and 5 have been shown to 
be involved in the desensitization of the rat thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), their 
role in the pathophysiology of hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (HTNs) is 
unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the expression pattern of the known GRKs in 
human thyroid tissue and investigated their function in the pathology of HTNs. 
The expression of different GRKs in human thyroid and HTNs was measured by 
Western blotting. The influence of GRK expression on TSHR function was analyzed 
by coexpression experiments in HEK 293 cells. We demonstrate that in addition to 
GRKs 2, 5 and 6, GRKs 3 and 4 are also expressed in the human thyroid. GRKs 2, 
3, 5 and 6 are able to desensitize the TSHR in vitro. This GRK-induced 
desensitization is amplified by the additional over-expression of beta-arrestin 
1 or 2. We did not find any mutations in the GRKs 2, 3 and 5 from 14 HTNs 
without TSHR mutations and Gsalpha mutations. The expression of GRKs 3 and 4 was 
increased in HTNs independently from the existence of TSHR mutations or Gsalpha 
mutations. In conclusion, the increased expression of GRK 3 in HTNs and the 
ability of GRK 3 to desensitize the TSHR in vitro, suggest a potential role for 
GRK 3 as a negative feedback regulator for the constitutively activated cAMP 
pathway in HTNs.
