The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of TSAHC 
[4'-(p-toluenesulfonylamido)-4-hydroxychalcone] in K/BxN serum transfer 
arthritis model and fibroblast-like synoviocytes of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA-FLS). In in vivo experiments, TSAHC attenuated the incidence and severity of 
arthritis in comparison with the vehicle group. Histological findings showed 
that TSAHC decreased the inflammation, bone erosion, cartilage damage, and 
osteoclasts activity in the ankle. Furthermore, we confirmed by biochemical 
analysis that the observations were associated with the decreased expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and RANKL in serum 
and ankle. In in vitro experiments, TSAHC induced apoptosis, while it 
significantly suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced cell 
proliferation in RA-FLS. Moreover, TSAHC inhibited mRNA expression of 
TNF-α-induced interleukin (IL)-6, MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13. Evaluation of 
signaling events showed that TSAHC inhibited the translocation and 
transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) by regulating 
phosphorylated-IκB-α (p-IκB-α) and IκB-α in TNF-α-induced RA-FLS. Our results 
suggest that TSAHC inhibits experimental arthritis in mice and suppresses 
TNF-α-induced RA-FLS activities via NF-κB pathway. Therefore, TSAHC may have 
therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA.
