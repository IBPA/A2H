ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruits of Juniperus rigida have been used in 
Korean traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in humans 
such as rheumatoid arthritis.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-atopic properties of 
J. rigida fruit in in vivo murine atopic dermatitis (AD) models.
METHODS AND RESULTS: BALB/c mouse ears ad SKH-1 hairless mice stimulated with 
oxazolone (4 weeks) and DNCB (3 weeks), respectively, were treated with the 1% 
Juniperus rigida fruit EtOH extract (JFE). The JFE improved AD symptoms in both 
oxazolone- and DNCB-induced AD mice by accelerating skin barrier recovery 
function and suppressing the overproduction of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and 
interleukin 4 (IL-4). The JFE was found to contain 
isoscutellarein-7-O-β-xylopyranoside, cupressuflavone, podocarpusflavone A, and 
hinokiflavone as major components based on phytochemical analysis. Eight 
flavonoids were isolated from JFE, and of those, cupressuflavone and 
isoscutellarein-7-O-β-xylopyranoside strongly down-regulated IL-4 expression and 
β-hexosaminidase release in RBL-2H3 cells.
CONCLUSION: Therapeutic attempts with J. rigida fruit and its active components 
might be useful in treating AD and related skin inflammatory diseases.
