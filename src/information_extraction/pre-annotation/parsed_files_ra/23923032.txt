Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a destructive arthropathy with systemic 
manifestations, characterized by chronic synovial inflammation. Under the 
influence of the pro-inflammatory milieu synovial fibroblasts (SFs), the main 
effector cells in disease pathogenesis become activated and hyperplastic while 
releasing a number of signals that include pro-inflammatory factors and tissue 
remodeling enzymes. Activated RA SFs in mouse or human arthritic joints express 
significant quantities of autotaxin (ATX), a lysophospholipase D responsible for 
the majority of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production in the serum and inflamed 
sites. Conditional genetic ablation of ATX from SFs resulted in attenuation of 
disease symptoms in animal models, an effect attributed to diminished LPA 
signaling in the synovium, shown to activate SF effector functions. Here we show 
that administration of 1-bromo-3(S)-hydroxy-4-(palmitoyloxy)butyl-phosphonate 
(BrP-LPA), a metabolically stabilized analog of LPA and a dual function 
inhibitor of ATX and pan-antagonist of LPA receptors, attenuates collagen 
induced arthritis (CIA) development, thus validating the ATX/LPA axis as a novel 
therapeutic target in RA.
