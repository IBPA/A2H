Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a crucial cytokine in inflammation processes and 
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory 
diseases. Strategies designed to blocking IL-1beta by passive administration of 
inhibitors (mAbs, IL-1 receptor antagonist) have previously demonstrated 
efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Using molecular modelling, we have 
defined three murine IL-1beta peptide regions characterized by their close 
proximity to the receptor. Synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions, in 
cyclic and linear form, were delivered as immunogens in Swiss mice, resulting in 
significant levels of autoantibodies directed against the native murine IL-1beta 
cytokine as determined by ELISA and by an assay for neutralization of IL-1beta 
biological activity. More importantly, one of the cyclic peptides showed a 
protective effect against inflammation and articular destruction in DBA/1 mouse 
collagen-induced arthritis, a model of RA. The high rate of success observed for 
active immunization against cytokine peptides in vivo suggests that the in 
silico approach to autoantigen design may be a promising avenue for the 
development of anti-cytokine immunotherapeutics.
