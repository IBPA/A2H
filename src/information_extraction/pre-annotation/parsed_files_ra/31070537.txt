CONTEXT: Garcinia mangostana Linn. (Guttiferae) pericarp is used as a 
traditional medicine in South Asia to treat inflammatory diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates therapeutic effects of G. mangostana pericarp 
ethanol extract (MAN) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and interactions with 
methotrexate in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats with CIA were treated with MAN 
(0.5 g/kg/day), methotrexate (0.5 mg/kg, bw) or combination of both for 36 days, 
respectively (n = 8/group). Another eight healthy and CIA rats served as normal 
and model control, respectively. Therapeutic effects were evaluated based on paw 
edema and arthritis score during the experiment and serological markers at the 
end of the study period. Histological and radiological examinations were used to 
assess joint destructions. The immune status was investigated by 
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: All treatments decreased the arthritis score and paw inflammation in 
CIA rats. Combination regimen significantly reduced anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide antibody in CIA rats to 85.83% (p < 0.05) and notably alleviated 
synovial hyperplasia and cartilage degradation in joints. Different from 
methotrexate, MAN significantly augmented CD25+ cells distribution (from 2.72 to 
3.35%) and IL-10 secretion (from 202.4 to 241.2 pg/mL) in CIA rat blood. 
Meanwhile, MAN induced a greater IL-17 decrease and a FOXP3 increase in immune 
organs than MTX. Reduced TLR4 and IL-17 expression and elevated FOXP3 expression 
in joints also occurred under MAN treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: MAN protected joints from destruction in CIA rats and exerted 
synergistic effects with methotrexate by improving immune microenvironment. The 
combination regimen could bring additional benefits to rheumatoid arthritis 
patients.
