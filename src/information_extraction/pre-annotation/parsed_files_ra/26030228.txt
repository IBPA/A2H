Understanding the cell-intrinsic cues that permit self-reactivity in 
lymphocytes, and therefore autoimmunity, requires an understanding of the 
transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in these 
cells. In this Review, we address seminal and recent research on microRNA 
(miRNA) regulation of central and peripheral tolerance. Human and mouse studies 
demonstrate that the PI3K pathway is a critical point of miRNA regulation of 
immune cell development and function that affects the development of 
autoimmunity. We also discuss how miRNA expression profiling in human autoimmune 
diseases has inspired mechanistic studies of miRNA function in the pathogenesis 
of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 
1 diabetes, and asthma.
