The saponin astragaloside IV (AST) is one of major active components purified 
from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bge, which has been used in traditional 
Chinese medicine to treat immune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The effects of AST on the suppression of experimental arthritis and its possible 
mechanisms are unknown. We measured the paw swelling of ankle joints, splenocyte 
proliferation, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and nitric 
oxide (NO) formation by macrophages in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). 
Intraarticular injection of IL-1β to rat knee joint for inducing the edema and 
in vitro IL-1β-stimulated cartilage impairment were examined. The results showed 
that oral treatment of AST (100 mg/kg/day) suppressed the joint inflammation and 
inhibited IL-1β, TNFα and NO production in macrophages from AIA rats. 
Macrophages were one of AST targeted cells, and mediated the reduced splenocyte 
proliferation in AIA rats. In addition, AST reduced the swelling induced by 
intraarticular injection of IL-1β, and protected against IL-1β-induced damage of 
cartilage proteoglycan synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation. We conclude that 
AST possesses antiarthritic effect and prevents IL-1β-induced joint inflammation 
and cartilage destruction. These findings suggest that AST may be used for the 
treatment of RA and other inflammatory joint diseases.
