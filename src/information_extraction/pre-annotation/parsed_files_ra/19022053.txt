The growth of blood and lymphatic vessels, namely angiogenesis and 
lymphangiogenesis, is well known to be of importance for tumor growth and 
metastatic spread. In fact, several therapeutic strategies are currently being 
pursued in the clinic to interfere with these processes. By contrast, vascular 
remodeling associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, such as psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, is only now emerging as a 
potential new target to treat these conditions. Animal models of inflammation, 
which mimic the inflammatory and the vascular phenotype of the disease, are 
important tools for studying inflammation and the accompanying (lymph)angiogenic 
response in vivo. This review provides a brief summary of our current knowledge 
of inflammation-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and of selected mouse 
models that can be used to analyze these processes in vivo. It also provides a 
detailed description of methods, such as immunofluorescence or 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that can be used to visualize and 
quantitate vascular remodeling in inflamed tissues.
