Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) have been 
observed in arthritic patients. The physiological enzyme(s) that degrade COMP, 
however, remain unknown. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) to search 
for proteins that associate with COMP to identify an interaction partner that 
might degrade it. One screen using the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of 
COMP as bait led to the discovery of ADAMTS-7. Rat ADAMTS-7 is composed of 1595 
amino acids, and this protein exhibits higher expression in the musculoskeletal 
tissues. COMP binds directly to ADAMTS-7 in vitro and in native articular 
cartilage. ADAMTS-7 selectively interacts with the EGF repeat domain but not 
with the other three functional domains of COMP, whereas the four C-terminal TSP 
motifs of ADAMTS-7 are required and sufficient for association with COMP. The 
recombinant catalytic domain and intact ADAMTS-7 are capable of digesting COMP 
in vitro. The enzymatic activity of ADAMTS-7 requires the presence of Zn2+ and 
appropriate pH (7.5-9.5), and the concentration of ADAMTS-7 in cartilage and 
synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is significantly increased as 
compared to normal cartilage and synovium. ADAMTS-7 is the first 
metalloproteinase found to bind directly to and degrade COMP.
