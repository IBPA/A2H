The effect of water extract of deer antler (DAA) prepared from the pilose antler 
of Cervus korean TEMMINCK var. mantchuricus Swinhoe (Nokyong) on 
collagen-induced mouse rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model was studied. 
Identification of common DAA capable of affording protection or modulating the 
onset and severity of arthritis may have important human health implications. 
DAA has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties 
in experimental animals. In this study, we determined the effect of 
DAA-injection on collagen-induced arthritis in mice. In three independent 
experiments, mice given DAA in water exhibited significantly reduced incidence 
of arthritis (30-45%) as compared with mice not given DAA in water (86-98%). The 
arthritis index also was significantly lower in DAA-injected animals. Western 
blot analysis showed a marked reduction in the expression of inflammatory 
mediators such as cyclooxygenase 2, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor α in 
arthritic joints of DAA-injected mice. The neutral endopeptidase activity was 
approximately six-fold higher in arthritic joints of non-DAA-injected mice in 
comparison to non-arthritic joints of unimmunized mice, whereas it was only 
two-fold higher in the arthritic joints of DAA-injected mice. Additionally, 
total IgG and type II collagen-specific IgG levels were lower in serum and 
arthritic joints of DAA-injected mice. Taken together our studies suggest that 
DAA may be useful in the prevention of onset and severity of arthritis.
