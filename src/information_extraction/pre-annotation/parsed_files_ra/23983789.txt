Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of autoimmune 
origin. Huo-luo-xiao-ling dan (HLXL) is an herbal mixture that has been used in 
traditional Chinese medicine over several decades to treat chronic inflammatory 
diseases including RA. However, the mechanism of the anti-arthritic action of 
this herbal remedy is poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, 
we determined by microarray analysis the effects of HLXL on the global gene 
expression profile of the draining lymph node cells (LNC) in the rat adjuvant 
arthritis (AA) model of human RA. In LNC restimulated in vitro with the 
disease-related antigen mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65), 84 
differentially expressed genes (DEG) (64 upregulated and 20 downregulated) 
versus 120 DEG (94 upregulated and 26 downregulated) were identified in 
HLXL-treated versus vehicle (Water)-treated rats, respectively, and 62 DEG (45 
upregulated and 17 downregulated) were shared between the two groups. The most 
affected pathways in response to HLXL treatment included immune response, 
inflammation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and metabolic processes, 
many of which are directly relevant to arthritis pathogenesis. These results 
would advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-arthritic 
activity of HLXL.
