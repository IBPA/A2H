Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from damaged or dead cells can activate DNA 
sensors that exacerbate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we 
show that ~40â€‰nm cationic nanoparticles (cNP) can scavenge cfDNA derived from RA 
patients and inhibit the activation of primary synovial fluid monocytes and 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Using clinical scoring, micro-CT images, MRI, and 
histology, we show that intravenous injection of cNP into a CpG-induced mouse 
model or collagen-induced arthritis rat model can relieve RA symptoms including 
ankle and tissue swelling, and bone and cartilage damage. This culminates in the 
manifestation of partial mobility recovery of the treated rats in a rotational 
cage test. Mechanistic studies on intracellular trafficking and biodistribution 
of cNP, as well as measurement of cytokine expression in the joints and cfDNA 
levels in systemic circulation and inflamed joints also correlate with 
therapeutic outcomes. This work suggests a new direction of nanomedicine in 
treating inflammatory diseases.
