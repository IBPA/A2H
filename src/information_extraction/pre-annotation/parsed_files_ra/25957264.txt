B cells have been generally considered to be positive regulators of immune 
responses because of their ability to produce antigen-specific antibodies and to 
activate T cells through antigen presentation. Impairment of B cell development 
and function may cause inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recently, specific 
B cell subsets that can negatively regulate immune responses have been described 
in mouse models of a wide variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The 
concept of those B cells, termed regulatory B cells, is now recognized as 
important in the murine immune system. Among several regulatory B cell subsets, 
IL-10-producing regulatory B cells are the most widely investigated. On the 
basis of discoveries from studies of such mice, human regulatory B cells that 
produce IL-10 in most cases are becoming an active area of research. There have 
been emerging data suggesting the importance of human regulatory B cells in 
various diseases. Revealing the immune regulation mechanisms of human regulatory 
B cells in human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases could lead to the 
development of novel B cell targeted therapies. This review highlights the 
current knowledge on regulatory B cells, mainly IL-10-producing regulatory B 
cells, in animal models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in clinical 
research using human samples.
