BACKGROUND: Genetic studies have pointed out that CD226 variants, encoding 
DNAM-1, could be associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. 
Therefore, we aimed to determine the influence of DNAM-1 on the development of 
arthritis using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
METHODS: CIA was induced in mice on a DBA/1 background, treated in parallel with 
a DNAM-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibody, a control IgG and PBS, respectively. 
CIA was also induced in mice deficient for DNAM-1(dnam1-/-) and control 
dnam-1+/+ mice on a C57/BL6 background. Mice were monitored for clinical and 
ultrasound signs of arthritis. Histological analysis was performed to search for 
inflammatory infiltrates and erosions. The Mann-Whitney U test for non-related 
samples was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: There was a non-significant trend for a less arthritic phenotype in 
mice receiving anti-DNAM-1 mAb at both clinical, ultrasound and histological 
assessments. But, we did not observe any difference between dnam1+/+ and 
dnam1-/- mice for incidence nor severity of clinical arthritis. Histological 
analysis revealed inflammatory scores similar in both groups, without evidence 
of erosion. Collagen antibodies levels were similar in all mice, confirming 
immunization with collagen.
CONCLUSION: Despite some clues suggesting a role of DNAM-1 in arthritis, these 
complementary approaches demonstrate no contribution of CD226/DNAM-1 in the 
arthritic phenotype. These results contrast with previous studies showing a role 
in vivo of DNAM-1 in some autoimmune disorders.
