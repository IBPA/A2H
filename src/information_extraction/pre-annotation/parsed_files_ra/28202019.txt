BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis, disease of unknown causes is a rheumatic and 
autoimmune pathology, recognised for its increasing frequency and its adverse 
consequences. It is a disease that occurs in most cases between 50 and 60 years 
and women are more affected than men. This study aimed at evaluating 
immunomodulatory and anti-arthritis capacity of aqueous and methanol extracts of 
stem bark of Piptadeniastrum africanum (Mimosaceae).
METHODS: ROS production from phagocytes, proliferation of T-cells, TNF-α and 
IL-1β production and cytotoxicity were performed by using chemiluminescence 
technique, liquid scintillation counter, ELISA and MTT assay, respectively. 
Anti-arthritic activity was evaluated using a model of adjuvant induced 
arthritis.
RESULTS: Methanol and aqueous extracts of Piptadeniastrum africanum 
significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited extracellular and intracellular ROS 
production. These extracts also possess significant (P < 0.001) inhibitory 
activity on T-cell proliferation other than reduced TNF-α and IL-1β production. 
Piptadeniastrum africanum also significantly exhibited antiarthritic activity in 
complete Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis in rat associated with a 
significant anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesia activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antihyperalgesia and 
anti-arthritis potential revealed in this study approve that, Piptadeniastrum 
africanum is a plant rich in compounds with anti-arthritic properties.
