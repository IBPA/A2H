Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is known to play a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we demonstrate the 
effects of SA13353 
(1-[2-(1-Adamantyl)ethyl]-1-pentyl-3-[3-(4-pyridyl)propyl]urea), a novel orally 
active inhibitor of TNF-alpha production, in animal models, and its mechanism of 
action on TNF-alpha production. SA13353 significantly inhibited 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha production in a dose-dependent manner 
in rats. Moreover, SA13353 exhibited a binding affinity for the rat vanilloid 
receptor and increased neuropeptide release from the rat dorsal root ganglion 
neurons. However, its effects were blocked by pretreatment with the transient 
receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist capsazepine. The ability of 
SA13353 and capsaicin to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-alpha production was eliminated 
by sensory denervation or capsazepine pretreatment in vivo. Although they 
inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in mice, these effects were not 
observed in TRPV1 knockout mice. SA13353 provoked the release of neuropeptides 
without nerve inactivation, even when chronically administered to rats. These 
results suggest that SA13353 inhibits TNF-alpha production through activation of 
capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons mediated via TRPV1 in vivo. Post-onset 
treatment of SA13353 strongly reduced the hindpaw swelling and joint destruction 
associated with collagen-induced arthritis in rats. Thus, SA13353 is expected to 
be a novel anti-arthritic agent with a unique mechanism of action.
