Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are extracellular pH sensors activated by 
protons, which influence retinal activity and phototransduction. Among all 
ASICs, ASIC1a is abundantly expressed in the retina and involved in normal 
retinal activity. Chloroquine, which has been used in the treatment of malaria, 
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, has been shown to be 
toxic to the retina. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this 
study, we investigated the role of chloroquine in phototransduction by measuring 
the electroretinogram (ERG). The effect of chloroquine on acid-evoked currents 
in either isolated rat retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) or Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells transfected with ASIC1a were assessed using a whole-cell patch-clamp 
technique. Chloroquine reduced the b-wave of scotopic 0.01 and photopic 3.0 and 
amplitudes of oscillatory potentials (OPs), an effect which was almost 
completely reversed by PcTx1, an ASIC1a-specific channel blocker. Further, 
patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that chloroquine reduced the peak current 
amplitude and prolonged the activation and desensitization of ASIC1a currents. 
These chloroquine-induced effects on the kinetics of ASIC 1a were dose-, pH- and 
Ca(2+)-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chloroquine 
affects vision conduction by directly modifying the kinetics of ASIC1a. Such a 
mechanism, may, in part, explain the retinal toxicity of chloroquine.
