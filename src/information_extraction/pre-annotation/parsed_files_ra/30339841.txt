Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by 
destructive polyarthritis and systemic complications. It increases 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanism underlying 
RA-related cardiac damage remains largely unknown. Here, we found and 
characterized a non-human primate (NHP) model with spontaneous RA similar to the 
human conditions. Compared with the control group, the cardiac function in RA 
monkeys showed progressively deterioration; histologically, we found 
significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration, cell death, and fibrosis 
in RA monkey heart tissue. Mechanistically, the upregulated receptor-interacting 
protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in RA monkey heart tissue bound to voltage-dependent 
anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1), increased VDAC1 oligomerization, and 
subsequently induced cardiac cell death and functional impairment. These 
findings identified that RIPK1-VDAC1 pathway is a promising target to treat 
cardiac impairment in RA. This unique model of RA will provide a valuable tool 
for mechanistic and translational studies.
