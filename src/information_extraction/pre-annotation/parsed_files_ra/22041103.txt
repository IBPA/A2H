ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dipsaci radix, the dried root of Dipsacus 
asperoides C.Y. Cheng et al T.M.Ai is used as a medicinal plant in oriental 
clinics for the treatment of bone diseases and functions by strengthening bone 
and healing bone fractures.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Dipsaci 
radix in treating rheumatoid arthritis using a type II collagen (CII)-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Arthritis was induced in male DBA/1 mice by immunization 
with CII. Dipsaci radix water (DR-W) extract at 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg was orally 
administered from days to after the induction of arthritis. Arthritic score, 
serum levels of anti-CII IgG2a, the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E(2) 
(PGE(2)), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6), and histological 
changes in the ankle joint were analyzed in CIA mice.
RESULTS: Arthritic induction increased the arthritic score, as well as serum 
levels of anti-CII IgG2a antibody, PGE(2), TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in mice. 
However, administration of DR-W extract in CIA mice significantly reduced 
arthritic scores and serum levels of anti-CII IgG2a antibody, PGE(2), TNF-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6 compared with those in vehicle-treated CIA mice. Furthermore, 
histopathological improvement in joint architecture was also observed in DR-W 
extract-treated CIA mice.
CONCLUSIONS: DR-W extract has anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects in 
arthritic mice. This suggests that Dipsaci radix might be used as a therapeutic 
agent for the treatment of human arthritis.
