Synovium hyperplasia characterizes joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). The cytotoxic effect of low-dose Cadmium (Cd) was tested in vitro and ex 
vivo on synoviocytes, the mesenchymal key effector cells of inflammation and 
proliferation in arthritis. The anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects 
of Cd were tested in vivo by intra-articular injection in the adjuvant induced 
arthritis rat joints, where the clinical scores and the consequences of 
arthritis were evaluated. Cell death through apoptosis was highly induced by Cd 
in inflammatory synoviocytes (80% reduction of cell viability, p < 0.01). TNF 
plus IL-17 cytokine combination induced a two-fold increase of Cd cell content 
by enhancing the ZIP-8 importer and the MT-1 homeostasis regulator expression. 
Addition of Cd reduced IL-6 production in TNF plus IL-17-activated synoviocytes 
(up to 83%, p < 0.05) and in ex-vivo synovium biopsies (up to 94%, p < 0.01). 
Cd-injection in rat joints improved arthritis, reducing clinical scores 
(arthritic score reduced from 4 to 2, p < 0.01), inflammatory cell recruitment 
(up to 50%, p < 0.01) and protecting from bone/cartilage destruction. This proof 
of concept study is supported by the limited Cd spread in body reservoirs, with 
low-dose Cd providing a safe risk/benefit ratio, without toxic effects on other 
cell types and organs.
