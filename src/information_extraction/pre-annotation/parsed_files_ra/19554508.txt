The GABAergic system, found in the adult mammalian brain and composed of 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 
(GAD) and GABA receptors, is also located in many peripheral nonneuronal 
tissues. Studies suggest that synovial membranes possess GABA, and that GABA 
participates in the control of the inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). However, no studies on the GABAergic system in synovial membranes have 
been done so far. Therefore, expression and distribution of the GABAergic system 
in the synovial membrane of the normal rat knee joint were investigated by 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses and 
immunohistochemistry. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed that mRNA encoding the 
GAD65 and GABAB receptor subunits necessary for the assembly of functional 
receptors, R1 and R2, are expressed in the synovial membrane. GAD and GABAB 
receptor subunits were localized in macrophage-like A cells of the synovial 
membrane. Macrophage-like A cells of the synovial membrane have a GABA 
production system and GABAB receptors, and GABA seems to play functional roles 
in the synovial membrane.
