This chapter describes the major principals, methods, and immunization protocols 
for the induction of a systemic autoimmune arthritis in genetically susceptible 
murine strains. The model is called proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) 
because the antigenic/arthritogenic material is isolated from cartilage. This 
autoimmune systemic disease is induced by intraperitoneal immunization of either 
BALB/c or certain C3H colonies with cartilage proteoglycan, an abundant 
component in articular cartilage. The chapter presents (a) methodological 
details on how to purify cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan by cesium chloride 
gradient centrifugation; (b) substitution of this highly purified 
antigenic/arthritogenic material with a crude cartilage extract obtained from 
knee joint cartilages removed during joint replacement surgery; and (c) 
substitution of human cartilage proteoglycan with pig, dog, sheep, or bovine 
cartilage proteoglycans for arthritis induction. The cartilage proteoglycan 
aggrecan requires partial deglycosylation, and necessary materials, methods, and 
protocols are described. In addition, basic methods for measuring 
antigen-specific T-cell-dependent immune responses, antibody production, serum 
cytokine levels, and alternative solutions for adoptive transfers are also 
described.
