Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has emerged as an important worldwide public health 
problem. Due to the lack of efficacy and major side effects related to many 
Western medical treatments, traditional Chinese medicine or herbal medicine is 
very often used to treat this disease. In the present study, we evaluated the 
effects of Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth. extraction (BCBE) in a rat model 
of RA induced by type-II collagen. Wistar rats with type-II collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) were given either 125 or 500 mg/kg of BCBE for RA. Paw swelling 
and weight were measured, and pathological joint sections of CIA rats were 
observed using the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining method. Protein and mRNA 
expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 
(MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) were determined by western 
blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
analysis in synovial tissue. During therapeutic treatment, BCBE significantly 
suppressed paw swelling, increased weight loss and ameliorated pathological 
joint changes. The protein and mRNA expressions of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-κB were 
downregulated in the CIA model when treated with BCBE. In conclusion, these 
results suggest that the treatment of RA with BCBE confers anti-RA activity and 
has therapeutic potential in this CIA model.
