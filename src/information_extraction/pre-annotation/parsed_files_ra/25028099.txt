Previous studies have demonstrated that interleukin-20 (IL-20) is a 
pro-inflammatory cytokine, and it has been implicated in psoriasis, lupus 
nephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and ulcerative colitis. Little 
is known about the effects of IL-20 in airway remodeling in asthma. The aim of 
our study was to demonstrate the function of IL-20 in airway remodeling in 
asthma. To identify the expression of IL-20 and its receptor, IL-20R1/IL-20R2, 
in the airway epithelium in bronchial tissues, bronchial biopsy specimens were 
collected from patients and mice with asthma and healthy subjects and stained 
with specific antibodies. To characterize the effects of IL-20 in asthmatic 
airway remodeling, we silenced and stimulated IL-20 in cell lines isolated from 
mice by shRNA and recombinant protein approaches, respectively, and detected the 
expression of α-SMA and FN-1 by Western blot analysis. First, overexpression of 
IL-20 and its receptor, IL-20R1/IL-20R2, was detected in the airway epithelium 
collected from patients and mice with asthma. Second, IL-20 increased the 
expression of fibronectin-1 and α-SMA, and silencing of IL-20 in mouse lung 
epithelial (MLE)-12 cells decreased the expression of fibronectin-1 and α-SMA. 
IL-20 may be a critical cytokine in airway remodeling in asthma. This study 
indicates that targeting IL-20 and/or its receptors may be a new therapeutic 
strategy for asthma.
