Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade is an effective treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory diseases, but in patients, it 
is associated with reduced resistance to the infectious agents Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes, among others. Our goal was to model 
infection and arthritis in mice and to compare etanercept, a currently used 
anti-TNF-α inhibitor, to an anti-TNF-α vaccine. We developed a murine surrogate 
of the TNF-α kinoid and produced an anti-murine TNF-α vaccine (TNFKi) composed 
of keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated to TNF-α, which resulted in anti-TNF-α 
antibody production in mice. We also used etanercept (a soluble receptor of TNF 
commonly used to treat RA) as a control of TNF neutralization. In a mouse model 
of collagen-induced arthritis, TNFKi protected against inflammation similar to 
etanercept. In a mouse model of acute L. monocytogenes infection, all 
TNFKi-treated mice showed cleared bacterial infection and survived, whereas 
etanercept-treated mice showed large liver granulomas and quickly died. 
Moreover, TNFKi mice infected with the virulent H37Rv M. tuberculosis showed 
resistance to infection, in contrast with etanercept-treated mice or controls. 
Depending on the TNF-α blockade strategy, treating arthritis with a TNF-α 
inhibitor could result in a different profile of infection suceptibility. Our 
TNFKi vaccine allowed for a better remaining host defense than did etanercept.
