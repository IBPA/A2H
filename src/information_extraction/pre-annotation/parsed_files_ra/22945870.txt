Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs) efficiently suppress a variety of autoimmune 
diseases. Over the past few years several potential mechanisms underlying this 
antiinflammatory activity have become apparent. Among these, terminal sialic 
acid residues in the sugar moiety of the immunoglobulin G constant fragment have 
been shown to be critical for the antiinflammatory activity of IVIgs in models 
of rheumatoid arthritis and immunothrombocytopenia (ITP). More recently, B cells 
and the sialic acid-binding protein CD22 were suggested to be involved in this 
IVIg-dependent immunomodulatory pathway. To study whether B cells are directly 
involved in IVIg-mediated suppression of acute autoimmune diseases, we tested 
the activity of IVIgs in mice deficient in B cells or CD22. We show that neither 
B cells nor CD22 are critical for the immediate antiinflammatory activity of 
IVIgs in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and ITP.
