Acupuncture is emerging as an alternative therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
However, the molecular mechanism underlying this beneficial effect of 
acupuncture has not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that 
electroacupuncture at acupoints Zusanli (ST36), Xuanzhong (GB39); and Shenshu 
(BL23) markedly decreased the paw swelling and the histologic scores of 
inflammation in the synovial tissue, and reduced the body weight loss in an 
adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model. However, the electrical stimulation at 
nonacupoint did not produce any beneficial effects against the experimental 
arthritis. Most interestingly, the electroacupuncture treatment resulted in an 
enhanced immunostaining for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a potent 
anti-inflammatory neuropeptide, in the synovial tissue. Moreover, the 
VIP-immunostaining intensity was significantly negatively correlated with the 
scores of inflammation in the synovial tissue (r = -0.483, P = .0026). In 
conclusion, these findings suggest that electroacupuncture may offer therapeutic 
benefits for the treatment of RA, at least partially through the induction of 
VIP expression.
