The development of spontaneous autoimmunity in inbred strains of rodents has 
allowed us to investigate the molecular basis of chronic inflammatory disease in 
ways that would not be possible in humans. Recently, two new mouse models of 
autoimmune inflammatory polyarthritis have been reported that demonstrate how 
alterations in signalling thresholds sufficient to perturb central T-cell 
tolerance lead to inflammatory arthritis. These mice provide new insights into 
the complexities of what may turn out to be a heterogeneous group of diseases 
that we call rheumatoid arthritis. They will also provide unique tools for 
dissecting precisely how chronically activated T cells contribute to the 
effector phase of arthritis through mechanisms that may be less dependent on 
antigen receptor signalling.
