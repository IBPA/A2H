OBJECTIVE: TNFα and IL-17 have been shown to be the major inflammatory cytokines 
involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we examined the 
effect of these cytokines on spontaneously occurring RA in our newly established 
arthritis-prone FcγRIIB- deficient C57BL/6 (B6) mice, designated KO1, by 
introducing genetic deficiency of TNFα and IL-17 into KO1 mice.
METHODS: KO1.TNFα(-/-) and KO1.IL-17(-/-) mice were established by crossing KO1 
with TNFα-deficient and IL-17-deficient B6 mice, respectively. The incidence and 
severity of RA, cartilage and bone destruction, immunological abnormalities, and 
transcription levels of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand 
(RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in ankle 
joints were compared among KO1, KO1.TNFα(-/-), and KO1.IL-17(-/-) mice.
RESULTS: The development of RA was completely inhibited in KO1.TNFα(-/-) mice. 
In contrast, KO1.IL-17(-/-) mice unexpectedly developed severe RA comparable to 
KO1. Compared with those in KO1 and KO1.IL-17(-/-) mice, frequencies of 
peripheral monocytes, known to be containing osteoclast precursors, were 
significantly decreased in KO1.TNFα(-/-) mice. Intriguingly, while RANKL 
expression levels in ankle joints did not differ among the three strains, OPG 
expression levels were drastically decreased in arthritis-prone, but not 
arthritis-free, mice. The expression levels of inflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines, such as MCP-1, IL-6, and TNFα, were up-regulated in 
arthritis-prone mice.
CONCLUSION: TNFα is indispensable while IL-17 is dispensable in the pathogenesis 
of RA in KO1 mice. In this model, TNFα may contribute to the development of 
arthritis, through mediating the increase in frequencies of osteoclast 
precursors in circulation and their migration into the joints, and the decrease 
in OPG expression, leading to the up-regulated osteoclastogenesis associated 
with severe cartilage and bone destruction.
