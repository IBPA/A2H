It is well known that rheumatoid arthritis patients taking nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are more susceptible to NSAIDs-induced 
gastroenteropathy in comparison with other patients. In this study we 
demonstrate that expression levels of interleukin (IL)-18 are related to 
aggravation of intestinal ulcerogenic lesions in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) 
rats following oral administration of indomethacin. AA rats were administered 
oral indomethacin (40 mg/kg) and killed under deep isoflurane anesthesia after 
24 h. The small intestinal mucosa was then examined. Oral administration of 
indomethacin caused hemorrhagic lesions in the small intestinal mucosa of AA 
rats, and the lesion score of AA rats 24 h after indomethacin treatment was 
approximately 5.6-fold higher than for normal rats administered indomethacin. 
IL-18 expression in the small intestinal mucosa of AA rats administered 
indomethacin was also higher in comparison with normal rats receiving 
indomethacin. In addition, interferon-γ and nitric oxide levels in the small 
intestinal mucosa of AA rats were increased following oral administration of 
indomethacin. It is possible that IL-18 expression in AA rats renders the small 
intestinal mucosa more sensitive to indomethacin, and that IL-18 may play a role 
in aggravating intestinal ulcerogenic lesions in AA rats treated with this drug.
