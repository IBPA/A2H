Proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine proteinase contained in neutrophil azurophilic 
granules, is considered a risk factor for vasculitides and rheumatoid arthritis 
when expressed on the outer leaflet of neutrophil plasma membrane and is the 
preferred target of antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCA) in Wegener 
granulomatosis. ANCA binding to PR3 expressed at the surface of neutrophils 
activates them. Evidence is provided that neutrophil apoptosis induced 
significantly more membrane PR3 expression without degranulation (but no 
enhanced membrane CD35, CD66b, CD63, myeloperoxidase, or elastase expression). 
This observation was confirmed on cytoplasts, a model of granule-free 
neutrophils. We hypothesized that PR3 could interact with proteins involved in 
membrane flip-flop (eg, phospholipid scramblase 1 [PLSCR1]). PR3-PLSCR1 
interaction in neutrophils was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and 
coimmunoprecipitation. In the RBL-2H3 rat mast-cell line stably transfected with 
PR3 or its inactive mutant (PR3S203A), PR3 externalization depended on PLSCR1, 
as shown by less PR3 externalization in the presence of rPLSCR1 siRNA, but 
independently of its serine-proteinase activity. Finally, apoptosis-externalized 
PR3 decreased the human macrophage-phagocytosis rate of apoptotic PR3 
transfectants. Therefore, in addition to ANCA binding in vasculitis, the 
proinflammatory role of membrane PR3 expression may involve interference with 
macrophage clearance of apoptotic neutrophils.
