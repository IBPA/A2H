In this paper we focus our attention on the role of two families of receptors, 
Toll-like receptors (TLR) and decoy receptors (DcR) involved in the generation 
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus-like syndromes in human and 
mouse models. To date, these molecules were described in several autoimmune 
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipids syndrome, bowel 
inflammation, and SLE. Here, we summarize the findings of recent investigations 
on TLR and DcR and their role in the immunopathogenesis of the SLE.
