Background. Shikonin is a major chemical component of zicao that possesses 
anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to mediate cellular and humoral 
immunity, especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the impact of 
shikonin on inflammatory response in RA synovial fibroblasts using the CAIA 
model. Methods. Severe polyarticular arthritis was induced in Balb/c female 
mice. Expressions of lncRNA-NR024118, SOCS3, proinflammatory cytokines, and MMPs 
were evaluated using RT-RCR. Histone acetylation and SOCS3 protein expression 
were assessed by ChIP assay and western blot, respectively. Results. Mice 
treated with shikonin showed an abrogation of soft tissue and bone lesions. 
Shikonin remarkably enhanced the expression of NR024118 and SOCS3 and suppressed 
the secretion and expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MMPs. Proliferation of cultured 
RA synovial fibroblasts in the presence of IL-1Î² was also significantly 
inhibited by shikonin. Moreover, shikonin dose-dependently increased acetylation 
of histone H3 at the promoter of NR024118. Finally, NR024118 overexpression and 
interference significantly changed SOCS3 expression and NR024118 interference 
could reverse regulation of shikonin on SOCS3, proinflammatory cytokines, and 
MMPs expression level in MH7A cells. Conclusion. Our results reveal that, in the 
CAIA mouse model of RA, shikonin has disease modifying activity that is 
attributable to the inhibition of inflammatory response via lncRNA-NR024118.
