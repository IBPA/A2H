ICOS is a key costimulatory receptor facilitating differentiation and function 
of follicular helper T cells and inflammatory T cells. Rheumatoid arthritis 
patients were shown to have elevated levels of ICOS+ T cells in the synovial 
fluid, suggesting a potential role of ICOS-mediated T cell costimulation in 
autoimmune joint inflammation. In this study, using ICOS knockout and knockin 
mouse models, we found that ICOS signaling is required for the induction and 
maintenance of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a murine model of rheumatoid 
arthritis. For the initiation of CIA, the Tyr181-based SH2-binding motif of ICOS 
that is known to activate PI3K was critical for Ab production and expansion of 
inflammatory T cells. Furthermore, we found that Tyr181-dependent ICOS signaling 
is important for maintenance of CIA in an Ab-independent manner. Importantly, we 
found that a small molecule inhibitor of glycolysis, 3-bromopyruvate, 
ameliorates established CIA, suggesting an overlap between ICOS signaling, PI3K 
signaling, and glucose metabolism. Thus, we identified ICOS as a key 
costimulatory pathway that controls induction and maintenance of CIA and provide 
evidence that T cell glycolytic pathways can be potential therapeutic targets 
for rheumatoid arthritis.
