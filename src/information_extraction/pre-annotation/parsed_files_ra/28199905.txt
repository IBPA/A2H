The increasing prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis has driven the development of 
new approaches and technologies for investigating the pathophysiology of this 
devastating, chronic disease. From the perspective of systems biology, combining 
comprehensive personal data such as metabolomics profiling with ultra-weak 
photon emission (UPE) data may provide key information regarding the complex 
pathophysiology underlying rheumatoid arthritis. In this article, we integrated 
UPE with metabolomics-based technologies in order to investigate 
collagen-induced arthritis, a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, at the 
systems level, and we investigated the biological underpinnings of the complex 
dataset. Using correlation networks, we found that elevated inflammatory and 
ROS-mediated plasma metabolites are strongly correlated with a systematic 
reduction in amine metabolites, which is linked to muscle wasting in rheumatoid 
arthritis. We also found that increased UPE intensity is strongly linked to 
metabolic processes (with correlation co-efficiency |r| value >0.7), which may 
be associated with lipid oxidation that related to inflammatory and/or 
ROS-mediated processes. Together, these results indicate that UPE is correlated 
with metabolomics and may serve as a valuable tool for diagnosing chronic 
disease by integrating inflammatory signals at the systems level. Our 
correlation network analysis provides important and valuable information 
regarding the disease process from a system-wide perspective.
