Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and systemic autoimmune disease characterized 
by inflammatory cell infiltration and joint erosion. Human adipose-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) have shown the capacity of suppressing effector T 
cell activation and inflammatory cytokine expression. We investigated whether 
hASCs play a therapeutic role in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by 
administering a single dose of hASCs in mice with established CIA. In vivo, a 
beneficial effect was observed following hASC infusion as shown by a marked 
decrease in the severity of arthritis. Human ASCs were detectable in the joints, 
and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the sera of the hASC-treated mice. 
Furthermore, hASC treatment induced the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
both in the peripheral blood and in the spleen tissues. In vitro, hASCs 
downregulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 
in mouse macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and inhibited the 
proliferation of human primary T cells in response to mitogens. Thus hASCs 
represent a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for RA.
