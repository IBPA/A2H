Polyphenolic anthocyanins are major colorful compounds in red fruits, known to 
prevent cardiovascular and other diseases. Grape polyphenols are a mixture of 
various molecules and their exact contribution to above bioactivities remains to 
be clarified. In the present study, we first analyzed the effect of purified 
grape-derived compounds on human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) 
survival, proliferation, as well as for their ability to inhibit the activation 
of human normal macrophages. Data indicated that malvidin-3-O-β glucoside 
(Malβg), the major grape anthocyanin, is bioactive with no toxicity on human 
PBMC. Malβg decreased the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory 
mediators, confirmed by the inhibition of TNFα, IL1, IL-6 and iNOS-derived 
nitric oxide (NO) secretion from activated macrophages. As Malβg also inhibited 
inflammatory response of rat macrophages, we investigated the anti-inflammatory 
potential of Malβg in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). Malβg 
significantly diminished inflammatory cachexia and arthritic paw scores in AIA 
rats at both therapeutic and preventive levels. In vivo effects of Malβg 
correlated with down-regulation of NO generation from AIA rats' peritoneal 
macrophages ex vivo. These data indicate that Malβg, major grape anthocyanin, is 
a potent anti-inflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo, without detectable toxic 
effect.
