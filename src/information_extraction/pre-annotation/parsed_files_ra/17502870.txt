Etanercept (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) is a human soluble p75 tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) receptor-human-IgG1 (hup75 TNFR-huIgG1) fusion protein used in the 
treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases in humans, including rheumatoid 
arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic 
arthritis, and psoriasis. To be able to study the effects of the soluble 
receptor fusion protein in mouse models, including those that mimic human 
granulomatous infections, a murine soluble p75-TNF receptor-murine IgG1 (murine 
p75-murine IgG1) fusion protein had to be constructed. This article discusses 
the generation, large-scale production, and purification of this molecule.
