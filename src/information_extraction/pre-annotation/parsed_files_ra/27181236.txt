Manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be attributed to both genetic and 
environmental factors. Some researchers have been focusing on intestinal 
microbiota which is thought to be one of the environmental factors that may 
enhance the development of RA. The advancement of culture-independent, high 
throughput microbial DNA sequencing had enabled us to understand the interplay 
between intestinal microbiota and host immune systems. In this study, we have 
reviewed the previous findings in animal and human studies with respect to the 
role of intestinal microbiota in RA. Mouse models of arthritis have demonstrated 
that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the disease development. K/BxN and 
IL-1 receptor-antagonist knock-out mice did not develop disease in germ free 
condition, however, colonization of particular intestinal bacteria was 
sufficient to induce arthritis. Moreover, the dysbiosis was observed in the 
human RA patients from United States, China and Finland. Thus, we believe that 
endeavors to improve the dysbiosis would serve as a novel therapeutic or 
preventive strategy in RA patients.
