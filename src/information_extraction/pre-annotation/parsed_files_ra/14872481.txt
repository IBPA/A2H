OBJECTIVE: In the K/BxN mouse model, autoantibodies against glucose-6-phosphate 
isomerase (GPI) cause arthritis. The relevance of this model for human disease 
remains a subject of controversy. We set out to determine whether GPI 
autoantibodies occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and, if so, at 
what stage of the RA.
METHODS: Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum from 131 RA patients 
and 28 healthy controls was tested for autoantibodies against recombinant human 
GPI. Patients were grouped according to disease duration and presence of 
rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid vasculitis, and Felty's syndrome, which are 
extraarticular complications of RA.
RESULTS: Elevated levels of autoantibodies against GPI were present in 5% of 
patients with uncomplicated RA and 4% of controls. In RA complicated by 
extraarticular manifestations, anti-GPI antibodies were observed in 18% of 
patients with rheumatoid nodules, 45% of patients with rheumatoid vasculitis, 
and 92% of patients with Felty's syndrome.
CONCLUSION: In patients with RA, autoantibodies to GPI are associated with the 
occurrence of extraarticular complications.
