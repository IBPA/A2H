Proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan-induced arthritis (PGIA) is a murine model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although BALB/c and DBA/2 mice share the same MHC 
(H-2d) haplotype, the BALB/c strain is susceptible to PGIA, while DBA/2 mice are 
resistant. Therefore, these two inbred mouse strains provide an opportunity to 
study arthritis susceptibility factors excluding the effects of MHC-associated 
genetic components. The goal of this study was to monitor changes in the 
cellular composition and activation state following intra-peritoneal (i.p.) 
immunization to induce PGIA; additionally, we sought to identify new 
susceptibility factors by comparing PG-induced immune responses in BALB/c and 
DBA/2 mice. Upon i.p. PG injection, resident naive B1 cells are replaced by both 
T cells and conventional B cells in the peritoneum of BALB/c mice. These 
peritoneal T cells produce IFNgamma and IL-17, cytokines shown to be important 
in RA and corresponding arthritis models. Moreover, peritoneal cells can 
adoptively transfer PGIA to SCID mice, demonstrating their arthritogenic 
properties. Our results indicate that repeatedly injected antigen leads to the 
recruitment and activation of immune cells in the peritoneum; these cells then 
trigger the effector phase of the disease. The migration and activation of 
T(h)1/T(h)17 cells in the peritoneal cavity in response to PG immunization, 
which did not occur in the arthritis-resistant DBA/2 strain, may be critical 
factors of arthritis susceptibility in BALB/c mice.
