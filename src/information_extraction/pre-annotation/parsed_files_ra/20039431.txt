OBJECTIVE: To assess the therapeutic potential of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies 
(mAb) for rheumatoid arthritis, using collagen-induced arthritis as an animal 
model.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization with type II 
collagen. After disease onset, a single injection of anti-CD3 mAb (20 
microg/mouse) was administered, and arthritis severity was monitored over a 
10-day period.
RESULTS: Anti-CD3 mAb treatment resulted in a sustained reduction in disease 
activity, which was associated with an increase in the proportion of naturally 
occurring CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and the generation of a 
population of CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. Anti-CD3 mAb treatment did not alter 
the capacity of CD4+ Treg cells to suppress effector T cell proliferation and 
interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) production in vitro. However, CD4+ Treg cells from 
both anti-CD3 mAb-treated and control mice were unable to suppress 
interleukin-17 (IL-17) production. In contrast, CD8+ Treg cells induced by 
anti-CD3 therapy suppressed IL-17 production as well as CD4+ T cell 
proliferation and IFNgamma production.
CONCLUSION: These results show that anti-CD3 mAb treatment has important 
therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis and has the capacity to generate 
antiarthritic CD8+ Treg cells and expand the relative numbers of CD4+ Treg 
cells.
