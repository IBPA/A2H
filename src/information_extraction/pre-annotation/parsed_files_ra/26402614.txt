PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep has an important role to play in the human immune 
system and it is critical in the restoration and maintenance of homeostasis. 
Sleep deprivation and disorders may have a profound impact on health, well being 
and the ability to resist infection. Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are 
multisystem disorders that involve complicated hormonal and immunological 
pathophysiology. Previous studies have suggested that sleep deprivation may lead 
to immunological disturbance in experimental mouse models.
RECENT FINDINGS: Sleep disorders may trigger immune system abnormalities 
inducing autoantibody production, possibly leading to the development of 
autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma or 
rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, in experimental models, it has been suggested that 
sleep deprivation may induce the onset of autoimmune disease.
SUMMARY: Chronic deprivation of sleep is common in modern society and has been 
seen in various autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. We have reviewed 
various aspects of sleep deprivation and sleep apnoea syndrome, and their 
effects on the immune system and their relevance to autoimmune diseases. We hope 
that these data will encourage greater awareness of the role that improved sleep 
hygiene may play in the management of these rheumatic diseases.
