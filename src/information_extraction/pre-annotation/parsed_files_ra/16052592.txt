OBJECTIVE: To address the ongoing debate concerning the specificity of synovial 
citrullinated proteins for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to analyze their 
pathophysiologic relevance to the induction or perpetuation of the RA-specific 
anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).
METHODS: Synovium of 19 RA patients and 19 non-RA controls was immunostained for 
the presence of citrullinated proteins with a mouse monoclonal antibody (F95), 
for the citrullinating enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase type 2 (PAD-2), and 
for the free citrulline-producing enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). 
Extending the RA cohort to 61 patients, the findings of anticitrulline staining 
in synovium were related to serum and synovial fluid ACPA levels, as measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: F95 staining indicated the presence of synovial intracellular 
citrullinated proteins in 53% of RA samples versus 5% of control samples, 
whereas extracellular staining was not RA specific. Immunoblotting and 
inhibition experiments confirmed that the antibody recognized citrullinated 
proteins but not free citrulline. Accordingly, iNOS was equally found in RA and 
control synovium and in intracellular citrullinated protein-positive and 
intracellular citrullinated protein-negative samples. In contrast, intracellular 
citrullinated proteins colocalized with PAD-2, which was found in 59% of RA 
samples versus 17% of control samples. Independent of local disease activity, 
the presence of the RA-specific synovial intracellular citrullinated proteins 
was associated with significantly higher systemic and local ACPA levels and with 
local ACPA production in the joint.
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the presence of RA-specific intracellular 
citrullinated proteins in synovium. The link with PAD-2 and local and systemic 
ACPA levels emphasizes their pathophysiologic relevance for RA-specific humoral 
autoimmunity.
