Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown 
aetiology, but it is now clear that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a central 
role in its pathogenesis. Ellagic acid (EA) has a variety of biological 
activities including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer 
properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential effect of 
ellagic acid on the prevention and/or treatment of adjuvant induced arthritis 
(AIA) model in mice. Ellagic acid treatment was started one week before AIA 
induction and continued for three weeks after induction of AIA. Ellagic acid 
treatment significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited foot paw oedematous swelling and 
attenuated AIA-associated pathology. Ellagic acid significantly (p < 0.01) 
reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin 1β (IL-1β), 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 17 (IL-17). However, serum 
levels of IL-10 and interferon γ (IFN-γ) significantly increased (p < 0.01 and p 
< 0.05, respectively), while serum level of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 
did not significantly alter with EA treatment. In conclusion, these results 
suggest that EA attenuated AIA-associated pathology in the mouse model by 
downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines.
