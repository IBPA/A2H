Our previous work has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have little 
therapeutic effect on rat arthritis induced by collagen. This study was aimed to 
further investigate whether the MSC lysates exhibit beneficial effects on 
rheumatoid arthritis. Aliquots of cell lysates from 1×10(7) human bone marrow 
MSC were intraperitoneally injected into collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) Wistar 
rats weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Methotrexate at a dose of 1 mg/kg or normal 
saline was served as positive and negative controls respectively. On week 4 the 
symptom scores were recorded and the hind joints of the rats were pathologically 
examined and X-ray examination was performed. The results showed that on week 4, 
the symptom scores of the rats that received MSC lysates (6.87 ± 0.83) and MTX 
(6.44 ± 1.13) were significantly lower than that of control rats (7.33 ± 0.77, P 
< 0.01). Meanwhile, pathological examination on the involved ankle showed that 
the synovitis and arthritis scores of MSC lysates and control groups were 2.28 ± 
0.48 and 2.28 ± 0.55 respectively, significantly higher than that of MTX 
treatment rats (0.71 ± 0.48, P < 0.05). However, X-ray examination on the ankle 
joints showed that the injury score of control rats was 4 ± 0.57, greatly higher 
than those from MSC lysates (2.71 ± 0.75) and MTX treatment groups (2.57 ± 0.78, 
P < 0.05 for both groups). It is concluded that MSC lysate infusion has 
beneficial effects on CIA rat, but the effectiveness seems inferior to MTX.
