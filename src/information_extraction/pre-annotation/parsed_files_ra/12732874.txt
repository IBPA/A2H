Before autoimmune diseases in humans can be treated with gene therapy, the 
safety and efficacy of the used vectors must be tested in valid experimental 
models. Monkeys, such as the rhesus macaque or the common marmoset, provide such 
models. This publication reviews the state of the art in monkey models for 
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and the (few) gene therapy 
experiments that have been performed in these models.
