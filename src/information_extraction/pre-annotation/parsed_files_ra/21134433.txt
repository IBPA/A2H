AIM OF THIS STUDY: Chinese herbal pill Yi Shen Juan Bi (YJB), which is a 
compound herbal drug, has traditionally been used as an anti-rheumatic drug in 
Chinese local clinics. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic effect of the YJB 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), using Freund's complete induced adjuvant arthritis 
(AA) in rat model.
METHODS: For that purpose, macrophage derived cytokine tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were measured in ex vivo by enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also assayed the effect of YJB on peritoneal 
macrophage derived nitric oxide (NO) in ex vivo by Griess reaction. 
Prostaglandin E (PGE) in metapedes was assayed by ultraviolet spectrophotometer 
method. Further synovial Bax level was examined by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: YJB significantly decreased the production of peritoneal macrophages 
derived TNF-α, IL-1 and NO. YJB also significantly decreased prostaglandin E 
(PGE) and upregulated the Bax expression in AA rat's synovium.
CONCLUSION: YJB is a potential anti-rheumatic agent targeting the inflammatory 
and immunomodulatory response of macrophages while down regulating the PGE and 
up-regulating the pro-apoptotic Bax expression. Such characteristics of YJB on 
AA may be advantageous to the treatment of clinical rheumatoid arthritis.
