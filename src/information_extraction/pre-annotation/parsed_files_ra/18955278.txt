Tibetan medicated-bath therapy has been applied to patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis for centuries. However, the detailed action mechanism of Tibetan 
medicated-bath therapy on the morphology and function of joints remains unknown. 
We designed our investigation to evaluate the efficacy of Tibetan medicated-bath 
therapy on adjuvant arthritis (AA) of rats in comparison with water-bath and 
dexamethasone administration. AA was induced by intradermal injection of 
Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in sterile mineral oil. The control animals 
were similarly injected with sterile vehicle. Eight days after injection, rats 
were treated with fresh-water bath, Tibetan medicated-bath (40 degrees C, 15 
min) or intramuscular injection with dexamethasone for 21 consecutive days after 
which we evaluated the severity of arthritis visually and microscopically and 
measured serum interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels. 
While arthritis did not significantly change after water-bath treatment, the 
Tibetan medicated-bath and dexamethasone groups showed diminished joint swelling 
and alleviation of, inflammatory cell infiltration and the destruction of bone 
and cartilage. Serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels significantly decreased. Our 
results demonstrated that Tibetan medicated-bath therapy exerted a reliable 
effect on rat adjuvant arthritis, which may be involved in the inflammatory 
cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Our data provide evidence for clinical use of 
Tibetan-medicated bath therapy for arthritis patients.
