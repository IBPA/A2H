IL-32, a newly-discovered proinflammatory cytokine that activates the p38MAPK 
and NF-kappaB pathways, is an important player in innate and adaptive immune 
response. IL-32, a cytokine produced mainly by T, natural killer, and epithelial 
cells induces significant amounts of TNFalpha and MIP-2 and increases the 
production of both cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. IL-32 has been 
implicated in inflammatory disorders, mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and influenza A virus infection, as well as in some 
autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn?s disease and in human stomach cancer, human lung cancer and breast cancer 
tissues. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-32 has pro-inflammatory effects 
on myeloid cells and causes the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into 
multinucleated cells expressing specific osteoclast markers. We recently found 
that human IL-32 has the capacity to provoke histamine release in human-derived 
cord blood mast cells (HDCBMC), but not in LAD 2 cells nor in rat peritoneal 
mast cells (RPMC), showing that IL-32 may be specie specific and act more in 
mature human mast cells (HDCBMC) than in transformed mast cells (LAD 2 cells). 
Certainly, IL-32 is another potent proinflammatory cytokine, however, the 
specific role of this newly-discovered protein in the network of cytokine 
biology remains to be determined.
