BACKGROUND: The inflammation that accompanies the pain and swelling associated 
with osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis is mediated by complex interactions of 
inflammatory mediators. Cytokines play a pivotal role in orchestrating many of 
these processes, including inflammatory cell recruitment, adhesion and 
activation. In addition, prostaglandins are secreted into the synovial cavity 
and are involved in perpetuation of local inflammation, vasodilatation and 
vasoconstriction, and also with bone resorption. Pre-clinical models have been 
developed in order to correlate to the human disease and principle among these 
is the adjuvant-induced arthritis model in the rat.
METHODS: We have developed a technique to quantitatively assess the contents of 
synovial fluid samples from rat joints. Two needles joined together are inserted 
into the knee joint of anaesthetised rats and connected to a Watson-Marlow 
perfusion pump. Sterile saline is infused and withdrawn at 100 microl min-1 
until a 250 microl sample is collected.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate up to 125 fold increases in synovial IL1alpha 
and IL1beta concentrations, approximately 30 fold increases in levels of IL6 and 
IL10 and a 200-300 fold elevation in synovial concentrations of TNFalpha during 
FCA-induced experimental arthritis. Finally, this novel technique has 
demonstrated a dose-response relationship between FCA and the total cell counts 
of synovial perfusates.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this new technique provides a robust method for 
quantifying inflammatory mediators and cells from the synovial cavity itself, 
thereby detailing the inflammatory processes from within the capsule and 
excluding those processes occurring in other tissues surrounding the entire 
articulation.
