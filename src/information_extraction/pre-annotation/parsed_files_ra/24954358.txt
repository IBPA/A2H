Increased risk of bone fractures is observed in patients with chronic 
inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid 
arthritis. Members of the Interferon Response Factor family of transcriptional 
regulators, IRF1 and IRF8, have been identified as genetic risk factors for 
several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We have investigated a 
potential role for the Irf1 gene in bone metabolism. Here, we report that 
Irf1(-/-) mutant mice show altered bone morphology in association with altered 
trabecular bone architecture and increased cortical thickness and cellularity. 
Ex vivo studies on cells derived from bone marrow stimulated with Rank ligand 
revealed an increase in size and resorptive activity of tartrate-resistant 
acid-positive cells from Irf1(-/-) mutant mice compared with wild-type control 
mice. Irf1 deficiency was also associated with decreased proliferation of bone 
marrow-derived osteoblast precursors ex vivo, concomitant with increased 
mineralization activity compared with control cells. We show that Irf1 plays a 
role in bone metabolism and suggest that Irf1 regulates the maturation and 
activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The altered bone phenotype of Irf1(-/-) 
mutants is strikingly similar to that of Stat1(-/-) mice, suggesting that the 
two interacting proteins play a critical enabling role in the common regulation 
of these two cell lineages.
