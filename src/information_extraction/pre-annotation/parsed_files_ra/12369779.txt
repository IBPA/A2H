Osteopetrosis is caused by a heterogenous group of bone diseases that result in 
an increase in skeletal mass because of inadequate osteoclastic bone resorption. 
In the op osteopetrotic rat, the disease has been linked to a single genetic 
locus located at the proximal end of rat chromosome 10. In this study, we 
identified a 1.5-cM genetic interval that contains the mutation. We then 
generated an improved radiation hybrid (RH) map of this region to identify 
potential functional and positional candidates for the op gene. Using the rat 
genome radiation hybrid panel, we mapped 57 markers including 24 genes (14 that 
have not yet been mapped in the rat) and 10 expressed sequence tag markers. 
Included in the mapped genes are several candidate genes that might 
significantly influence the biochemical pathways involved in osteopetrosis. 
These include genes involved in osteoclast differentiation, apoptosis, and the 
functional capabilities of mature osteoclasts to resorb bone. Further analysis 
of the genes and expressed transcripts mapped to this region may yield important 
insights into the multifactorial control of osteoclast function and the 
mechanisms of failed bone homeostasis in diseases such as osteopetrosis, 
osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis in which failed bone homeostasis is an 
instigating or exacerbating circumstance of the disease process.
