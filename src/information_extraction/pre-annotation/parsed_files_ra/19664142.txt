Immature dendritic cells (iDCs) have a tolerogenic potential due to low 
expression of important co-stimulatory cell surface molecules required for 
antigen presentation and induction of an effective immune response. We report 
here that injection of iDCs pulsed with chick type II collagen (CII) delayed the 
onset significantly and suppressed the severity of spontaneous polychondritis 
(SP) in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ6alphabeta8alphabeta transgenic 
mouse model. Bone marrow-derived iDCs were pulsed in vitro with CII and 
transferred into 6-week-old HLA-DQ6alphabeta8alphabeta transgenic mice. Mice 
receiving CII-pulsed iDCs did not display any clinical signs of disease until 
5.5 months of age, indicating the ability of the DC vaccine to delay 
significantly the onset of SP. Control groups receiving unpulsed iDCs or 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) developed polyarthritis at 3.5 months, as we 
have reported previously. The severity and incidence of disease was reduced in 
mice injected with CII-pulsed iDCs. Proinflammatory cytokines were in low to 
undetectable levels in the serum and tissue in the CII-pulsed iDC mice, 
correlating with the protection. This is the first evidence of iDC therapy 
controlling SP and suggests that iDC vaccination may provide a tool to reducing 
clinical manifestations in human inflammatory autoimmune disease such as 
relapsing polychondritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
