In comparison with linear polymers, dendrimers' multivalency and nanostructure 
confer substantial advantages in drug delivery including rapid cell entry, 
targetability, and easier passage across biological barriers. Previous work has 
shown that phosphorus-containing dendrimers capped with anionic 
azabisphosphonate (ABP) end groups prompt anti-inflammatory activation of human 
monocytes. By using two mouse models of arthritis mimicking human rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), Hayder et al. recently demonstrated that intravenous injection 
of dendrimer ABP inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and 
osteoclastogenesis--two fundamental monocyte-dependent processes of inflammation 
and bone erosion in RA. While available biological therapies for RA target only 
one of the cytokines involved in inflammation or bone erosion, dendrimer ABP, by 
virtue of its double action on both processes in mice, might become a more 
active and cost-saving alternative for RA patients. This Perspective highlights 
this important development and the challenges that lie ahead.
