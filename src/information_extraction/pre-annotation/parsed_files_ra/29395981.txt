Isothiocyanates 7a and 7b have poor stability and aqueous solubility. To address 
these problems, prodrugs 8a and 8b were synthesized. Prodrugs 8a and 8b were 
stable in HEPES buffer at pH 4.4, but released the active compounds 7a and 7b in 
HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and in mouse plasma, respectively. Compound 8a and 
especially compound 8b showed anti-inflammatory effects. Compound 8b 
demonstrated significant efficacy in animal models of traumatic inflammation, 
acute inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis. Compound 8b also did not cause 
appreciable toxicity in mice after 5 weeks at a daily dose of 200 mg/kg.
