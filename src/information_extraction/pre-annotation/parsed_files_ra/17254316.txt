During the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies to IgG-Fc, 
citrullinated proteins, collagen type II (CII), glucose 6 phosphoisomerase 
(G6PI) and some other self-antigens appear. Of these, a pathogenic effect of the 
anti-CII and anti-G6PI antibodies is well demonstrated using animal models. 
These new antibody mediated arthritis models have proven to be very useful for 
studies involved in understanding the molecular pathways of the induction of 
arthritis in joints. Both the complement and FcgammaR systems have been found to 
play essential roles. Neutrophils and macrophages are important inflammatory 
cells and the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1beta is 
pathogenic. The identification of the genetic polymorphisms predisposing to 
arthritis is important for understanding the complexity of arthritis. Disease 
mechanisms and gene regions studied using the two antibody-induced arthritis 
mouse models (collagen antibody-induced arthritis and serum transfer-induced 
arthritis) are compared and discussed for their relevance in RA pathogenesis.
