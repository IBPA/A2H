BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a 
chronic, systemic inflammation that may affect many tissues and organs, but 
principally the synovial joints. The tendency for joint destruction is greatest 
in the early stages of disease hence current trend is to introduce a 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) immediately after the diagnosis of 
RA in a step- up approach which is generally followed by its combination with a 
corticosteroid or NSAID.
OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a slow acting DMARD used in the early 
stage of RA. NSAIDs if given in combination with HCQ would provide immediate 
symptomatic relief from pain and inflammation even before HCQ starts showing its 
disease modifying effects. Long half life of HCQ results in its accumulation in 
the body while frequent intake of NSAIDs results in severe GI side effects. 
Present project aims at minimizing these shortcomings by designing co-drugs of 
HCQ and NSAIDs as a potential combination RA therapy.
METHOD: Synthesis of two co-drugs was achieved by CDI coupling, followed by 
their spectral characterization. In vitro release kinetics was studied by HPTLC 
in aqueous buffers and tissue homogenates of upper GIT.
RESULTS: Prodrugs were resistant to hydrolysis in buffers (pH 1.2 and 7.4) and 
stomach homogenates of Wistar rat but 32- 65% hydrolysis was observed in small 
intestinal homogenates.
CONCLUSION: We propose that the mutual prodrug strategy of a DMARD with NSAID 
could be useful in initial management of RA wherein NSAIDs would produce their 
anti-inflammatory effect and simultaneously the process of joint reconstruction 
by hydroxychloroquine could be initiated.
