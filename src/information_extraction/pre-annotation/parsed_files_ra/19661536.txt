The term psoriatic disease encompasses the array of disorders (arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II 
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) that are associated with psoriasis. 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is present in about 25% of patients with psoriasis; in 
most cases, the psoriasis precedes joint disease by about 10 years. Previous 
studies revealed that osteoclast precursors (OCP) are elevated in PsA and that 
the frequency of these circulating cells correlates with bone destruction. More 
recently OCP were found to be increased also in early rheumatoid arthritis and 
in 25% of psoriasis patients without arthritis. Bone marrow edema, observed on 
magnetic resonance imaging, in PsA represents infiltration of underlying marrow 
with inflammatory cells based on studies in transgenic tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) arthritis murine models. Studies in the TNF transgenic mouse model also 
revealed that changes in lymph node volume precede joint flare. These 
translational studies point to potential biomarkers of arthritis in psoriasis 
patients and generate alternative hypotheses to explain the events that lead to 
arthritic flare.
