BACKGROUND: Destructive erosion of bone or osteolysis is a major complication of 
inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontal disease, 
and periprosthetic osteolysis. Natural plant-derived products have received 
recent attention as potential therapeutic and preventative drugs in human 
disease.
METHODS: The effect of Angelica sinensis (AS) extract on RANKL-induced 
osteoclast differentiation was examined in this study. The osteoclast precursor 
cell line bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) was cultured and stimulated with RANKL 
followed by treatment with AS at several doses. Gene expression profiles of 
c-Fos, c-Jun, NFATc1, TRAP, and OSCAR were sequentially evaluated.
RESULTS: AS extract inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in BMMs 
in a dose-dependent manner without any evidence of cytotoxicity. AS extract 
strongly inhibited p38, ERK, JNK, p65 phosphorylation and I-ÎºB degradation in 
RANKL-stimulated BMMs. AS extract also inhibited the mRNA expression of c-Fos, 
c-Jun, NFATc1, TRAP, and OSCAR in RANKL-treated BMMs. Moreover, RANKL-induced 
c-Fos, c-Jun and NFATc1 protein expression was suppressed by AS extract.
CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively suggested that AS extract demonstrated 
inhibitory effects on RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow 
macrophages in vitro, indicating that AS may therefore serve as a useful drug in 
the prevention of bone loss.
