One of the therapeutic strategies under development for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis is based on reinstating immune tolerance by vaccination 
with autologous dendritic cells with potent tolerogenic function. These 
tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDC) can be generated ex vivo and have beneficial 
therapeutic effects in animal models of arthritis. Although experimental animal 
models have been instrumental in the development of this novel immunotherapeutic 
tool, several outstanding questions regarding the application of TolDC remain to 
be addressed. This paper reviews what has been learnt to date from studying the 
therapeutic potential of TolDC in animal models of arthritis and discusses 
issues relating to preventive versus curative effects of TolDC, the antigen 
specificity of TolDC therapy, the route, dose and frequency of TolDC 
administration and the safety of TolDC treatment. Lessons learnt from animal 
models will aid the design of clinical trials with TolDC.
