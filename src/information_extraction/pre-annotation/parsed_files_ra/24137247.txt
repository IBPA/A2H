Osteoarthritis is a common chronic and progressively degenerative joint 
condition. The stem bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (a member of the 
Eucommiaceae family), which is also known as Du-Zhong, is a traditional Chinese 
medicine commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 
mechanisms underlying the effects of Eucommia in the treatment of arthritis of 
the knee require further study. The present study investigated the effects of an 
aqueous extract of Eucommia on the articular cartilage (by Mankin's grade) and 
the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3 and MMP-13 in the serum 
and synovial fluid in a rat model of osteoarthritis. The serum levels of MMP-1, 
-3 and -13 were measured by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) at weeks 1, 2 and 4. The levels of MMP-1, -3 and 13 were 
significantly decreased in the rats treated with Eucommia compared with those in 
the control rats (P<0.05). Histopathological examination results indicated a 
lower Mankin's grade in the Eucommia group compared with that of the control 
rats. Therefore, Eucommia was demonstrated to have a cartilage-protecting effect 
in rats with osteoarthritis, potentially by improving cartilage metabolism, 
regulating the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the articular 
cartilage, and inhibiting apoptosis in chondrocytes, thereby slowing down joint 
degeneration.
