Increasing evidence suggests that superantigens play a role in immune-mediated 
diseases. Superantigens are potent activators of CD4+ T cells, causing rapid and 
massive proliferation of cells and cytokine production. This characteristic of 
superantigens can be exploited in diseases where strong immunologic responses 
are required, such as in the B16F10 animal model of melanoma. Superantigen 
administration is able to significantly enhance ineffective anti-tumor immune 
responses, resulting in potent and long-lived protective anti-tumor immunity. 
However, superantigens are more well-known for the role they play in diseases. 
Studies using an animal model for neurologic demyelinating diseases such as 
multiple sclerosis show that superantigens can induce severe relapses and 
activate autoreactive T cells not involved in the initial bout of disease. This 
may also involve epitope spreading of disease. Superantigens have also been 
implicated in acute diseases such as food poisoning and TSS, and in chronic 
diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Viral superantigens are 
also involved in the disease process, including superantigens derived from human 
immunodeficiency virus and mouse mammary tumor virus. Finally, immunotherapies 
that ameliorate the role played by superantigens in disease are discussed.
