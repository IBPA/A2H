CCN1, an extracellular protein also known as cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61), 
is a novel pro-inflammatory factor involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis. As an inflammatory disease, psoriasis is characterized by 
keratinocyte activation-induced epidermal hyperplasia and cytokine-mediated 
inflammation. We demonstrated in our previous study that CCN1 promoted 
keratinocyte activation in psoriasis. However, the role of CCN1 in regulating 
inflammation in psoriasis is still unknown. Here, we showed that CCN1 increased 
inflammatory cytokine IL-1β production in keratinocytes. Furthermore, endogenous 
ATP and caspase-1 were required for mature IL-1β production stimulated by CCN1 
in keratinocytes. After binding to the receptor of integrin α6β1, CCN1 activated 
the downstream p38 MAPK signaling pathway, thus inducing the expression of 
IL-1β. In addition, we inhibited CCN1 function in mouse models of psoriasis, and 
decreased IL-1β production was observed in vivo. Overall, we showed that CCN1 
increased IL-1β production via p38 MAPK signaling, indicating a role for CCN1 
protein in regulating inflammation in psoriasis.
