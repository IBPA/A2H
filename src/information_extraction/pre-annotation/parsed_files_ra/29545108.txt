Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that functions 
in cooperation with various cofactors to regulate gene expression. In the immune 
system, YY1 enhances cytokine production and T helper (Th) 2 effector cell 
differentiation, resulting in the activation of inflammation. However, no 
studies have reported the role of YY1 in Th17 cell regulation, which is 
implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the expression of YY1 
in Th17 cells in vitro and revealed increased levels of YY1 mRNA and protein. To 
elucidate the function of YY1 pathogenesis in RA, we used a collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model with YY1 deficiency. Deficiency of YY1 reduced the 
severity of arthritis and joint destruction. Moreover, Th17 cells were 
dramatically reduced in YY1-deficient mice. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 was 
decreased in YY1-deficient CD4+ T cells ex vivo and in vivo. Interestingly, the 
level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), tumor 
necrosis factor-α, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-1β were markedly decreased in 
YY1-deficient mice with CIA. The cytokine-inducing function of YY1 was more 
specific to IL-17 than to interferon-γ. YY1 plays a role in Th17 cell 
differentiation and RA pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that future RA 
therapies should target the regulatory mechanism involved in Th17 cell 
differentiation, in which YY1 may cooperate with the STAT3 signaling pathway.
