Human allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a cytoplasmic protein primarily 
identified in human and rat allografts, and data from several studies suggest an 
important role for AIF-1 in inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to 
examine the association between AIF1 rs2269475:C>T polymorphism and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). AIF1 genotype was determined by means of the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 276 White patients 
with RA and 236 healthy subjects. The frequency of the AIF1 rs2269475 TT 
genotype was significantly higher in the patients with RA than in the controls 
(OR=5.59, 95% CI: 1.22-25.55). The frequency of T allele carriers in the patient 
group with RA was 31.9% vs 19.1% among controls (P=0.0003). Moreover, the 
frequency of individuals positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(anti-CCP) antibodies was significantly elevated in the T allele carriers 
(OR=8.82, 95% CI: 2.06-37.7). It is noteworthy that no significant linkage 
disequilibria between the AIF1 C/T and DRB1 alleles associated with RA 
development and anti-CCP antibody production [including the most frequent, i.e. 
*04 (32.7%) and *01 (23.5%)] (P>0.1) were found. Our results show that the AIF1 
rs2269475 T allele is associated with increased risk of RA development. 
Moreover, the frequency of individuals positive for anti-CCP antibodies is 
significantly increased among T allele carriers.
