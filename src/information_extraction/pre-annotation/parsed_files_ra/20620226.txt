Although cigarette smoking is a solid environmental risk factor for rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) as revealed by epidemiological studies, the scientific basis has 
not been provided. Proinflammatory cytokines produced by synoviocytes are 
implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. As cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) is 
able to up-regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines from human 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes, we studied the effect of CSC on induction of 
arthritis in the mouse model of collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA). When 
mainstream CSC or sidestream CSC was administered into DBA/1J mice at the time 
of immunization with collagen and complete Freund adjuvant, CSC dose-dependently 
augmented the induction and clinical development of arthritis at both young and 
older mice. Peritoneal injected mainstream CSC one day before immunization also 
exhibited the augmenting effect, suggesting the systemic effect of CSC. These 
results support the etiological role of cigarette smoking in RA.
