Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most common cause of chronic 
arthritis in childhood and adolescents and encompasses a heterogeneous group of 
different diseases. Due to the promising results of B-cell depleting therapies 
in rheumatoid arthritis the role of B-cells in autoimmune diseases has to be 
discussed in a new context. Additionally, experiments in mouse models have shed 
new light on the antibody-independent role of B-cells in the development of 
autoimmune diseases. In this review we will discuss the importance of B-cells in 
the pathogenesis of JIA appraising the question for an immunological basis of 
B-cell targeted therapy in JIA.
