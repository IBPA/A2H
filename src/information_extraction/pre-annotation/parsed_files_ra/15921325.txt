OBJECTIVE: To establish a kind of gene therapy method of rheumatoid arthritis, 
to construct the interleukin-18-PE38 fusion gene expression vector and to 
explore the expression of the fusion gene in the chondrocytes and 3T3 cells.
METHODS: Interleukin-18-PE38 fusion gene was cleaved from plasmid 
PRKL459k-IL-18-PE38 by restriction enzyme digestion, then linked with vectors 
PsecTag2B and transformed into competence bacteria, positive clones were 
selected and confirmed by restrictive enzyme (EcoRI) digestion assay. The 
rearrangement plasmid PsecTag2B-IL-18-PE38 was transfected into 3T3 cells and 
mouse chondrocytes by liposome protocol (experimental group), null vector was 
used as negative control, and the transient expression was identified by 
fluorescence Restrictive enzymes digestion analysis revealed that the length of 
the interleukin-immunocytochemical assay.
RESULTS: 18-PE38 fusion gene was 6000 bp. Fluorescence immunocytochemical method 
showed that fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is strong,while 
fluorescence intensity of the control group is weak.
CONCLUSION: The eukaryotic expression vector PsecTag2B-IL-18-PE38 is established 
successfully which can be expressed in the 3T3 cells and mouse chondrocytes. Our 
results lay a foundation for the further investigation for rheumatoid arthritis 
therapy.
