Defects in IL-4-producing CD1d-autoreactive NKT cells have been implicated in 
numerous Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases, including diabetes, multiple 
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and systemic sclerosis. Particular 
attention has been focused on autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
(IDDM) because nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and humans with IDDM are both 
reported to express severe deficiencies in the frequency and Th2 functions of 
NKT cells. Furthermore, experimental manipulations of the NKT defect in the NOD 
mouse induced corresponding changes in disease. Taken together, these converging 
studies suggested a general role of NKT cells in natural protection against 
destructive autoimmunity. However, in previous reports the identification of NKT 
cells was based on indirect methods. We have now devised a direct, highly 
specific CD1d tetramer-based methodology to test whether humans with IDDM have 
associated NKT cell defects. Surprisingly, although we find marked and stable 
differences in NKT cells between individuals, our study of IDDM patients and 
healthy controls, including discordant twin pairs, demonstrates that NKT cell 
frequency and IL-4 production are conserved during the course of IDDM. These 
results contradict previous conclusions and refute the hypothesis that NKT cell 
defects underlie most autoimmune diseases.
