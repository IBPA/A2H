Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease with clinical and biological 
polymorphisms. IL-1RN is a protein that binds to interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors 
and inhibits the binding of IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta. IL-1RN levels are elevated 
in the blood of patients with a variety of infectious, immune, and traumatic 
conditions. Balb/c mice deficient in IL-1ra (mouse gene of IL-1RN) develop 
spontaneous autoimmune arthritis while DBA/1 mice deficient in IL-1ra do not. 
Previously, we identified a major QTL that regulates the susceptibility to 
arthritis in Balb/c mice with IL-1ra deficiency. In this study, we found that 
the QTL may contain two peaks that are regulated by two sets of candidate genes. 
By haplotype analysis, the total genomic regions of candidate genes were reduced 
from about 19 Mbp to approximately 9 Mbp. The total number of candidate genes 
was reduced from 208 to 21.
