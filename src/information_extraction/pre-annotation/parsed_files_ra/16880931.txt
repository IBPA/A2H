Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the quorum sensing signalling molecule 
N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL). This natural product not only 
coordinates production of virulence factors by the bacterium, but also has 
immunomodulatory effects on the host organism. Immunomodulatory small molecules 
are valuable for immunology research and are potential therapeutics for 
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and immunosuppressive drugs 
following organ transplants. We describe the total synthesis of OdDHL using 
solid-supported reagents and scavengers, which has the potential to be used for 
automated analogue synthesis. OdDHL and four analogues were tested for their 
ability to activate or inhibit release of the pro-inflammatory mediators tumour 
necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and nitric oxide (NO) from equine or murine 
macrophages (immune cells). Two of the analogues showed substantial 
immunomodulatory activity with these macrophages. One analogue showed differing 
species selectivity, being a potent antagonist in mouse cells, but a partial 
agonist in horse-derived macrophages. These compounds have the therapeutic 
potential to be used for protecting animals from bacterial septic shock.
