Our aging population and the accompanying decline in immune function is a 
growing concern that may be addressed by finding natural methods to enhance the 
immunocompetence of our elderly. Bovine milk and colostrum from cows that have 
been immunized have been shown to provide additional immunoglobulins and other 
bioactive molecules that enhance immune function. The purpose of this study was 
to investigate the ability of hyperimmune bovine colostrum to alleviate the 
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in a murine model. The collagen-induced 
arthritis DBA/1J murine model was used for this study. Mice were fed colostrum 
from immunized cows at either 5 or 10 mg/mouse per day or controls for 49 d. The 
data showed that the colostrum-fed groups had significantly lower total swelling 
scores and significantly lower collagen-specific antibody (IgG2a), 
inflammation-associated antibody (total IgG), and the inflammatory cytokines 
tumor necrosis factor α, IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-γ. The results strongly suggest 
that colostrum from immunized cows may have anti-inflammatory activity in a 
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis.
