OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased risk of 
fragility fractures. In RA patients, the direct effect of inflammation on bone 
is difficult to study because their skeleton is also affected by medication with 
corticosteroids and other drugs as well as aging and menopause, which contribute 
to bone fragility. This study used an animal model of chronic arthritis to 
evaluate the direct impact of chronic inflammation on biomechanical properties 
and structure of bone.
METHODS: In the SKG mouse chronic arthritis model three point bending tests were 
performed on femoral bones and compression tests on vertebral bodies. Collagen 
structure was analysed using second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging with a 
two-photon microscope, ultramorphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and bone density using 
water pycnometer.
RESULTS: Arthritic bones had poor biomechanical quality compared to control 
bones. SHG, SEM and pycnometry disclosed variable signs of impaired collagen 
organization, poor trabecular architecture and low bone density.
CONCLUSION: Present data demonstrate for the first time that chronic 
inflammation per se, without confounding influence of drugs and aging, leads to 
impairment of bone biomechanics in terms of stiffness, ductility and ultimate 
strength (fracture).
