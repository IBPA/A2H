Dendrimers are highly branched "tree-like" polymers that have demonstrated 
therapeutic potential in drug delivery, medical imaging, and tissue engineering 
in recent years. In addition, we have shown that an azabisphosphonate 
(ABP)-capped dendrimer selectively targets monocytes and directs them toward 
anti-inflammatory activation. We explored this property to assess the 
therapeutic potential of dendrimer ABP in the treatment of an inflammatory 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis. Intravenous injections of dendrimer ABP inhibited 
the development of inflammatory arthritis in two animal models: IL-1ra(-/-) mice 
and mice undergoing K/BxN serum transfer. Suppression of disease was 
characterized by normal synovial membranes, reduced levels of inflammatory 
cytokines, and the absence of cartilage destruction and bone erosion. Dendrimer 
ABP also exhibited anti-osteoclastic activity on mouse and human cells, mediated 
by c-FMS (cellular-feline McDonough strain sarcoma virus oncogene homolog) 
inhibition. These preclinical demonstrations suggest the potential use of 
dendrimer ABP as a nanotherapeutic for rheumatoid arthritis.
