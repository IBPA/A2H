Bone destruction at inflamed joints is an important complication associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) may suppress not only 
inflammation but also induction of osteoclasts that play key roles in the bone 
destruction. If IL-10-producing osteoblast-like cells are induced from patient 
somatic cells and transplanted back into the destructive bone lesion, such 
therapy may promote bone remodeling by the cooperative effects of IL-10 and 
osteoblasts. We transduced mouse fibroblasts with genes for IL-10 and Runx2 that 
is a crucial transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation. The 
IL-10-producing induced osteoblast-like cells (IL-10-iOBs) strongly expressed 
osteoblast-specific genes and massively produced bone matrix that were 
mineralized by calcium phosphate in vitro and in vivo. Culture supernatant of 
IL-10-iOBs significantly suppressed induction of osteoclast from 
RANKL-stimulated Raw264.7 cells as well as LPS-induced production of 
inflammatory cytokine by macrophages. The IL-10-iOBs may be applicable to novel 
cell-based therapy against bone destruction associated with RA.
