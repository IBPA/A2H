Triptolide, a purified component of Tripterygiumwilfordii Hook F, has been shown 
to have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Although triptolide has demonstrated that it could suppress bone 
destruction in collagen-induced mice, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. 
Many studies have investigated the effect of triptolide on Tregs and 
Tregs-related cytokine involved in RA. Additionally, previous studies have 
implied that Tregs inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Thus, 
in this study we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism by which triptolide 
influences the Treg-mediated production of IL-10 and TGF-β1 to affect osteoclast 
differentiation and bone resorption. In cocultures system of Tregs and mouse 
bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), Tregs inhibited the differentiation of 
osteoclasts and reduced the resorbed areas significantly and the production of 
both IL-10 and TGF-β1 was upregulated. When the coculture systems were 
pretreated with triptolide, they produced higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Our 
data indicate that triptolide enhances the suppressive effects of Tregs on 
osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing the secretion of 
IL-10 and TGF-β1. Tregs are most likely involved in the triptolide-mediated 
regulation of bone metabolism and may provide a potential therapeutic target for 
the treatment of inflammatory bone destruction.
