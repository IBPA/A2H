Elevated free radical generation in inflamed joints and impaired antioxidant 
system has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Green tea extracts 
(GTE) have been shown to reduce inflammation in inflammatory arthritis murine 
model. This study investigates possible mechanisms by which vitamin C and GTE 
protect joints in RA rat model. This study included forty adult male rats that 
were divided into four groups (10 rats each); control group, collagen II induced 
RA group (CII), CII treated with vitamin C (CII + Vit C) and CII treated with 
GTE (CII + GTE) in physiology laboratory, Assiut University, Egypt. After 45 
days of treatment, plasma levels of lipid peroxides (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), 
ceruloplasmin (CP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), uric acid (UA) and glutathione 
(GSH) were detected using colorimetric methods, PGE(2) using ELISA and copper 
(Cu) and zinc (Zn) using spectrometer. In CII group, levels of LPO, NO, PGE(2), 
UA, CP, Cu were higher while SOD, GSH, Zn were lower than controls. In groups 
treated with vitamin C and GTE, levels of SOD, GSH were increased while levels 
of LPO, NO, PGE(2), Cu, CP were decreased compared with CII group. Levels of UA 
were decreased and Zn increased in GTE treated group compared with CII group. 
GTE treated group showed higher Zn and low Cu levels compared with vitamin C 
treated group. This study suggests proper GTE and vitamin C intake may 
effectively normalize the impaired oxidant/antioxidant system and delaying 
complication of RA.
