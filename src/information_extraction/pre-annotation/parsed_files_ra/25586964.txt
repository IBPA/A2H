Sappanchalcone, a bioactive flavonoid isolated from the heartwood of Caesalpinia 
sappan L. possesses anti-inflammatory effects. We studied the efficacy of 
sappanchalcone in attenuating collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a mouse model 
of rheumatoid arthritis. Sappanchalcone was purified to homogeneity from the 
chloroform fraction of the methanolic extract of C. sappan, and identified using 
mass spectrometry and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CIA-induced 
male DBA/1J mice were divided into control, sappanchalcone-treated, and 
methotrexate-treated groups (n = 10 per group). Paw swelling, arthritis 
severity, radiographic and histomorphometric changes were assessed to measure 
the protective role of sappanchalcone against chronic disease progression. 
Sappanchalcone administration significantly reduced clinical arthritis and 
inflammatory edema in paws. Bone mineral density and trabecular structure were 
maintained in CIA mice administered sappanchalcone. The levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and 1L-1β) were significantly lower in 
the serum of sappanchalcone-treated mice as compared with the control group. Our 
results suggest that sappanchalcone could be used as an anti-inflammatory and 
bone-protective agent during the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
