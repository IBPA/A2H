OBJECTIVE: To characterize the proteomic profiles of joint synovial tissue in 
normal rats and rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and identify the proteins 
related with the occurrence of RA to explore the pathogenesis of RA.
METHODS: SD rat models of RA were established using Mtb (heat-killed 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
proteomics technology was employed to analyze the difference in synovial tissue 
protein profiles between RA model rats and normal rats, and two of the 
differentially expressed proteins were verified with Western blotting and 
fluorescence quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Comparison of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns from the 
model rats and normal rats showed 4 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated proteins 
by 2 folds in the RA model rats. Western blotting and fluorescent quantitative 
PCR of 2 of the 8 proteins yielded consistent results with those by proteomics 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Arthritis synovial lesions in RA represent very complex pathological 
processes involving a variety of proteins, and these differentially expressed 
proteins may contribute to the progression of RA.
