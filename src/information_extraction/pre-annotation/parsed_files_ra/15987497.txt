Models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in laboratory animals are important tools 
for research into pathogenic mechanisms and the development of effective, safe 
therapies. Rodent models (rats and mice) have provided important information 
about the pathogenic mechanisms. However, the evolutionary distance between 
rodents and humans hampers the translation of scientific principles into 
effective therapies. The impact of the genetic distance between the species is 
especially seen with treatments based on biological molecules, which are usually 
species-specific. The outbred nature and the closer anatomical, genetic, 
microbiological, physiological, and immunological similarity of nonhuman 
primates to humans may help to bridge the wide gap between inbred rodent strain 
models and the heterogeneous RA patient population. Here we review clinical, 
immunological and pathological aspects of the rhesus monkey model of 
collagen-induced arthritis, which has emerged as a reproducible model of human 
RA in nonhuman primates.
