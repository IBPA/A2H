BayÃ©s syndrome is an under-recognized clinical condition characterized by 
inter-atrial block (IAB). This is defined electrocardiographically as P-wave 
duration > 120 ms and can be categorized into first, second and third degree 
IAB. It can be caused by inflammatory conditions such as systemic sclerosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis, abnormal protein deposition in cardiac amyloidosis, or 
neoplastic processes invading the inter-atrial conduction system, such as 
primary cardiac lymphoma. It may arise transiently during volume overload, 
autonomic dysfunction or electrolyte disturbances from vomiting. In other 
patients without an obvious cause, the predisposing factors are diabetes 
mellitus, hypertensive heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia. IAB has a strong 
association with atrial arrhythmogenesis, left atrial enlargement (LAE), and 
electro-mechanical discordance, increasing the risk of cerebrovascular accidents 
as well as myocardial and mesenteric ischemia. The aim of this review article is 
to synthesize experimental evidence on the pathogenesis of IAB and its 
underlying molecular mechanisms. Current medical therapies include 
anti-fibrotic, anti-arrhythmic and anti-coagulation agents, whereas 
interventional options include atrial resynchronization therapy by single or 
multisite pacing. Future studies will be needed to elucidate the significance of 
the link between IAB and atrial tachyarrhythmias in patients with different 
underlying etiologies and optimize the management options in these populations.
