OBJECTIVE: Tolerization of T cells directed against a target autoantigen is a 
desired goal of experimental approaches for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases, and novel and improved methods of tolerance induction are continuously 
being sought. Because most traditional methods of tolerance induction using 
soluble antigen are effective in the prevention of autoimmunity but fail to 
control established disease, this study was carried out to explore an innovative 
tolerogenic approach for the treatment of ongoing disease, using the rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model of human rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Lewis (RT.1(l)) rats were injected subcutaneously with heat-killed 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra to induce AIA. Before or after AIA induction, 
Lewis rats were treated intraperitoneally (IP) with tolerogenic B cells 
expressing a fusion construct of mycobacterial 65-kd heat-shock protein (Hsp65) 
and IgG heavy-chain. For comparison, control rats were treated IP with ovalbumin 
(OVA)-IgG-expressing B cells or soluble mycobacterial Hsp65, and the effects on 
AIA were observed. We also tested the immune response to mycobacterial Hsp65 in 
B cell-tolerized rats.
RESULTS: Administration of tolerogenic mycobacterial Hsp65-expressing B cells as 
well as soluble mycobacterial Hsp65, but not OVA-expressing B cells, resulted in 
a significant decrease in the severity of subsequent AIA. However, in rats with 
established disease, only the B cell regimen of mycobacterial Hsp65, but not the 
soluble antigen, suppressed ongoing AIA.
CONCLUSION: Mycobacterial Hsp65-IgG-expressing B cells can successfully 
attenuate the progression of AIA. This study introduces a promising approach for 
the treatment of arthritis that should be further explored.
