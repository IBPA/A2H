ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The leaves of Markhamia tomentosa (Benth.) K. 
Schum (Bignoniaceae) are used traditionally for the treatment of oedema and 
rheumatoid arthritis in Nigeria.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the work was to investigate the anti-inflammatory 
activity of the ethanolic leaf extract of Markhamia tomentosa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract was screened using the carrageenan-induced 
paw oedema in rats, xylene-induced oedema in mice and the formalin-induced 
oedema in mice at 50, 100, 200mg/kg doses p.o respectively. The mechanism by 
which the extract mediated the anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using the 
histamine-induced rat paw oedema and serotonin-induced rat paw oedema at the 
highest dose (200mg/kg).
RESULTS: The results showed that the extract produced a significant 
dose-dependent inhibition in carrageenan-induced, xylene-induced and the 
formalin tests. The extract exerted a significant inhibition of 54.55% 
(P<0.0001) and 42.11% (P<0.01) at 90 min in the histamine-induced and 
serotonin-induced rat paw oedema models respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the ethanolic leaf extract of Markhamia 
tomentosa possesses anti-inflammatory activity possibly mediated by histamine. 
The results justify the use of the plant in the preparation of ethno medicines 
used in the treatment of ailments associated with inflammation.
