We have defined previously five quantitative trait loci controlling development 
of pristane-induced arthritis in a cross between E3 and DA rats. To define new 
loci controlling the disease we have mapped three recombinant inbred strains 
between DA and E3 and analysed an F2 cross between DA rats and one of these RI 
strains. Two novel loci affecting disease severity are identified on chromosome 
1 (Pia8) and chromosome 4 (Pia7) respectively. We could also reproduce the 
earlier identified Pia3 locus on chromosome 6 associated with arthritis onset. 
In the original E3xDA F2 cross, neither of the loci Pia7, Pia8, or Pia1 showed 
any association with arthritis. To investigate the possibility of interacting 
loci preventing the phenotypic expression of other loci, the E3xDA F2 cross was 
re-analysed with a model for a two locus interaction, knowing the presence of 
these newly identified loci. We found suggestive evidence for an interaction 
where an effect of Pia7 and Pia1 on disease severity depends on DA homozygosity 
at specific loci, which themselves do not confer susceptibility. This shows that 
additional disease associated loci can be identified if other loci are 
neutralized. This will be of importance for understanding the complex genetics 
controlling rheumatoid arthritis.
