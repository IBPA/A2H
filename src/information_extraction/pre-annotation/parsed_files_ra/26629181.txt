Inflammation and oxidative stress were involved in the development and 
progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Isorhamnetin has anti-inflammatory and 
anti-oxidative activities, but its effects on RA have not been investigated. In 
order to observe the possible therapeutic effects of isorhamnetin on RA, we 
established a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model and treated the animal with 
isorhamnetin for 3 weeks. Besides, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were 
treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and isorhamnetin. The severity of 
arthritis was assessed by arthritis score, joint destruction score and 
inflammation score. Levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, 
IL-10 and IL-35 in the joint tissue homogenate and cell culture medium as well 
as anti-type II collagen antibody in serum were measured using ELISA. Contents 
of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in joint tissue homogenate were measured using 
assay kits. We found collagen immunization induced significant arthritis in mice 
and isorhamnetin at the dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day could significantly 
attenuate the collagen-induced arthritis. Isorhamnetin also modulated the 
production of cytokines and suppressed the oxidative stress in the mice with 
collagen-induced arthritis at the dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day. These data 
suggested that isorhamnetin might be a potential agent for the management of RA.
