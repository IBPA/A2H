Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an experimental autoimmune disease that can 
be elicited in susceptible strains of rodents (rat and mouse) and nonhuman 
primates by immunization with type II collagen (CII), the major constituent 
protein of articular cartilage. Following immunization, these animals develop an 
autoimmune polyarthritis that shares several clinical and histological features 
with rheumatoid arthritis. Susceptibility to CIA in rodents is linked to the 
class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and the immune 
response to CII is characterized by both the stimulation of collagen-specific T 
cells and the production of high titers of antibody specific for both the 
immunogen (heterologous CII) and the autoantigen (mouse CII). Histologically, 
murine CIA is characterized by an intense synovitis that corresponds precisely 
with the clinical onset of arthritis. Because of the pathological similarities 
between CIA and rheumatoid arthritis, the CIA model has been the subject of 
extensive investigation. Here, we describe the specifics for establishing the 
murine model of CIA, including specific requirements for the handling and 
preparation of the CII antigen, procedures for immunization, selection of 
susceptible mouse strains for study, and procedures for the evaluation and 
quantitation of the autoimmune arthritis.
