Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) have long been considered promising drug 
targets for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as 
cancer and cardiovascular diseases. But the lack of specificity, isoform 
selectivity and poor biopharmaceutical profile of PI3K inhibitors have so far 
hampered rigorous disease-relevant target validation. Here we describe the 
identification and development of specific, selective and orally active 
small-molecule inhibitors of PI3Kgamma (encoded by Pik3cg). We show that 
Pik3cg(-/-) mice are largely protected in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis; 
this protection correlates with defective neutrophil migration, further 
validating PI3Kgamma as a therapeutic target. We also describe that oral 
treatment with a PI3Kgamma inhibitor suppresses the progression of joint 
inflammation and damage in two distinct mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, 
reproducing the protective effects shown by Pik3cg(-/-) mice. Our results 
identify selective PI3Kgamma inhibitors as potential therapeutic molecules for 
the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.
