Although(,) vascular remodeling is a hallmark of many chronic inflammatory 
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and 
psoriasis, anti-vascular strategies to treat these conditions have received 
little attention to date. We investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of 
systemic blockade of VEGF-A by the inhibitory monoclonal antibody G6-31, 
employing a therapeutic trial in a mouse model of psoriasis. Simultaneous 
deletion of JunB and c-Jun (DKO*) in the epidermis of adult mice leads to a 
psoriasis-like phenotype with hyper- and parakeratosis and increased 
subepidermal vascularization. Moreover, an inflammatory infiltrate and elevated 
levels of cytokines/chemokines including TNFalpha, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-6, and the 
innate immune mediators IL-22, IL-23, IL-23R, and IL-12p40 are detected. Here we 
show that anti-VEGF antibody treatment of mice already displaying disease 
symptoms resulted in an overall improvement of the psoriatic lesions leading to 
a reduction in the number of blood vessels and a significant decrease in the 
size of dermal blood and lymphatic vessels. Importantly, anti-VEGF-treated mice 
showed a pronounced reduction of inflammatory cells within the dermis and a 
normalization of epidermal differentiation. These results demonstrate that 
systemic blockade of VEGF by an inhibitory antibody might be used to treat 
patients who have inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis.
