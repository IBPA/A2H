OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that typically induces 
secondary osteoporosis, which increases the risk of bone fractures. 
Anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody is used to treat RA; however, its 
effect on bone strength is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the influence 
of MR16-1, an anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody, on bone structure and femoral 
strength in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
METHOD: DBA/1J mice were immunized by intradermal injection of bovine type II 
collagen. MR16-1 was administered intraperitoneally at the same time as 
immunization. Thirty-five days after the first immunization, bone structure and 
bone strength were measured by micro-computed tomography and the three-point 
bending test.
RESULTS: In the CIA group, most bone mineral density and bone structure 
parameters in the foot, femur, and lumbar spine were significantly lower than in 
the normal group. Moreover, the maximum load of the femoral shaft in the CIA 
group was significantly lower than in the normal group. MR16-1 treatment 
significantly prevented the CIA-induced deterioration of bone structure and loss 
of bone strength.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CIA systemically induces a deterioration 
of bone structure and loss of bone strength, and that IL-6 signalling plays an 
important role in these processes.
