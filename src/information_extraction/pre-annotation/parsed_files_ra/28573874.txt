PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to induce dry skin as an 
extra-articular symptom. However, the mechanisms behind the induction are 
unclear. In this study, we utilized an arthritis mouse model to simulate RA to 
reveal the relationship between arthritis and dry skin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DBA/1JJmsSlc control mice (n = 5) and DBA/1JJmsSlc 
collagen-induced arthritis mouse model (arthritis mice; n = 5) were used. We 
measured transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and capacitance to reveal the effect 
of arthritis on skin barrier function. In addition, we measured the expression 
of biomarkers of skin barrier function.
RESULTS: We found that the hind limb volume of the arthritis mice was higher 
than that of the control mice. Our results showed that the arthritis mice had 
higher TEWL and lower capacitance when compared to the control mice. When 
compared to that of the control mice, the skin of the arthritis mice was thicker 
with more leukocyte infiltration. In the skin of arthritis mice, we observed 
lower expression of type I and IV collagens, but higher expression of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -9 when compared to that of the control mice. The 
levels of mast cells, histamine, substance P, and tryptase were higher in the 
arthritis mice than in the control mice. This study showed that the arthritis 
mice exhibited a disruption of skin barrier function (i.e. dry skin), which was 
improved following treatment with a mast cell inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results on mast cells suggested that an improvement of dry skin 
is important for RA management.
