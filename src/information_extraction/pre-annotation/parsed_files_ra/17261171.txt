The antibody-mediated targeted delivery of cytokines to sites of disease is a 
promising avenue for cancer therapy, but it is largely unexplored for the 
treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. Using both radioactive and 
fluorescent techniques, the human monoclonal antibodies L19 and G11 (specific to 
two markers of angiogenesis that are virtually undetectable in normal adult 
tissues) were found to selectively localize at arthritic sites in the murine 
collagen-induced model of rheumatoid arthritis following intravenous (i.v.) 
administration. The same animal model was used to study the therapeutic action 
of the L19 antibody fused to the cytokines IL-2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
and IL-10. Whereas L19-IL-2 and L19-TNF treatment led to increased arthritic 
scores and paw swellings, the fusion protein L19-IL-10 displayed a therapeutic 
activity, which was superior to the activity of IL-10 fused to an antibody of 
irrelevant specificity in the mouse. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has 
been investigated for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but 
clinical development plans have been discontinued because of a lack of efficacy. 
Because the antigen recognised by L19 is strongly expressed at sites of 
arthritis in humans and identical in both mice and humans, it suggests that the 
fusion protein L19-IL-10 might help overcome some of the clinical limitations of 
IL-10 and provide a therapeutic benefit to patients with chronic inflammatory 
disorders, including arthritis.
