CD147, a membrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is highly 
upregulated during dynamic cellular events including tissue remodelling. 
Elevated CD147 expression is present in the joint of rheumatoid arthritis 
patients. However, the role of CD147 in bone destruction remains unclear. To 
determine whether CD147 is involved in osteoclastogenesis, we studied its 
expression in mouse osteoclasts and its role in osteoclast differentiation and 
function. CD147 expression was markedly upregulated during osteoclast 
differentiation. To investigate the role of CD147 in receptor activator of 
nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone 
resorption activity, osteoclast precursor cells were transfected with CD147 
siRNA. Decreased CD147 expression inhibited osteoclast formation and bone 
resorption, inhibited RANKL-induced nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor 
of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 and decreased the expression of the d2 isoform of 
vacuolar ATPase Vo domain and cathepsin K. Therefore, CD147 plays a critical 
role in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts by upregulating NFATc1 
through the autoamplification of its expression in osteoclastogenesis.
