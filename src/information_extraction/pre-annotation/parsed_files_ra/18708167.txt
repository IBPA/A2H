Arthritis literally means joint inflammation. Arthritis is not a single disease. 
Arthritis refers to a group of rheumatic diseases and other conditions that can 
cause pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints. The forms range from those 
related to wear and tear of cartilage (such as osteoarthritis) to those 
associated with inflammation resulting from an overactive immune system (such as 
rheumatoid arthritis). Arthritis is more heterogeneous and this is an important 
starting point when discussing animal models for arthritis. Animal models are 
instrumental in understanding the etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of 
rheumatoid arthritis. Several new mouse models have either been produced. 
Various methods have been applied to induce in animals experimental models of 
arthritis which would provide important insights into the aetiopathogenetic 
mechanisms of human RA.
