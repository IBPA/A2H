The objective of this study was to determine the expression and effects of 
B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) in T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis, a rat 
model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) 
was induced by intradermal injection of 0.1ml complete Freund's adjuvant. 
Arthritis was evaluated by the histopathological examination of joint ankle. The 
BLyS expression was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. The level of BLyS 
and interleukin (IL)-17 were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 
gene expression of BLyS and its receptors (TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R) were assessed 
by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The effect of 
BLyS on the function of T cell was investigated by transwell assay. Using an AA 
rat model, we detected dysregulated expression and level of BLyS and its 
receptors in the local joint synovium tissue, peripheral lymphoid organs 
(spleen) and immune cells (macrophage, dendritic cells (DC) and T cell) at the 
peak of inflammation. In vitro, BLyS-treated DC induced IL-17 producing T cells. 
Neutralization of BLyS by the TACI-Ig fusion protein attenuated these 
stimulating effects of BLyS. These data suggest that the overproduction of BLyS 
may contribute to T cell responses and may be an attractive target for control 
of autoimmune diseases, such as RA, that involves both T and B cells.
