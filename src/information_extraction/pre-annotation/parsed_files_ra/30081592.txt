Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the joints 
affecting about 0.3⁻1% of the population in different countries. About 50⁻60 
percent of RA patients respond to presently used drugs. Moreover, the current 
biomarkers for RA have inherent limitations. Consequently, there is a need for 
additional, new biomarkers for monitoring disease activity and responsiveness to 
therapy of RA patients. We examined the micro-RNA (miRNA) profile of immune 
(lymphoid) cells of arthritic Lewis rats and arthritic rats treated with 
celastrol, a natural triterpenoid. Experimental and bioinformatics analyses 
revealed 8 miRNAs (miR-22, miR-27a, miR-96, miR-142, miR-223, miR-296, miR-298, 
and miR-451) and their target genes in functional pathways important for RA 
pathogenesis. Interestingly, 6 of them (miR-22, miR-27a, miR-96, miR-142, 
miR-223, and miR-296) were further modulated by celastrol treatment. 
Interestingly, serum levels of miR-142, miR-155, and miR-223 were higher in 
arthritic versus control rats, whereas miR-212 showed increased expression in 
celastrol-treated rats compared with arthritic rats or control rats. This is the 
first study on comprehensive miRNA expression profiling in the adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AA) model and it also has revealed new miRNA targets for celastrol in 
arthritis. We suggest that subsets of the above miRNAs may serve as novel 
biomarkers of disease activity and therapeutic response in arthritis.
