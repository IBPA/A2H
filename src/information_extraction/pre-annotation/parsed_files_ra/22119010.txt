In this review, we discuss our studies on the pathogenesis of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) and related mouse models for rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, 
these models invariably rely on the use of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Our 
analysis has focused on explaining the dichotomous - either protective or 
disease-promoting - role of endogenous IFN-γ. Induction of a myelopoietic burst 
by CFA was identified as an important and underestimated factor in mediating the 
role of IFN-γ and other cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, GCP-2, RANK-L). Myelopoiesis 
provides an excess in precursors for joint-infiltrating neutrophils and 
osteoclasts. We postulate that classical CIA is primarily an auto-inflammatory 
disease, in part because of a strong innate immune response to the adjuvant. 
Superimposed on this, collagen-specific auto-immunity reinforces inflammatory 
reactivity in joints.
