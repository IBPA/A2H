OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the B cell tropic γ-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) is aberrantly expressed in its latent and lytic forms within ectopic 
lymphoid structures (ELS) in the salivary glands of patients with Sjögren's 
syndrome (SS), and to investigate the relationship between EBV dysregulation, B 
cell activation, in situ differentiation of autoreactive plasma cells, 
disease-specific autoantibody production, and cytotoxicity.
METHODS: Latent and lytic EBV infection in the salivary glands of 28 patients 
with SS and 38 patients with nonspecific chronic sialadenitis (NSCS), 
characterized for the presence or absence of ELS, was investigated by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and 
immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining. Glandular versus synovial 
production of anti-Ro 52, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and 
anti-EBV peptide antibodies was analyzed in situ or in vivo in human SS/SCID and 
human rheumatoid arthritis/SCID mouse chimeras.
RESULTS: EBV dysregulation within inflammatory infiltrates was observed 
exclusively in ELS+ SS salivary gland tissue, as revealed by latent EBV 
infection and lytic EBV infection in B cells and plasma cells, respectively. 
Conversely, epithelial latent membrane protein 2A expression was observed in 
both patients with SS and patients with NSCS. Importantly, perifollicular plasma 
cells displaying Ro 52 immunoreactivity were frequently infected by EBV. 
Furthermore, ELS-containing SS salivary gland tissue that was transplanted into 
SCID mice supported the production of anti-Ro 52/anti-La 48 and anti-EBV 
antibodies but not ACPAs. Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell localization and 
granzyme B expression demonstrated that the persistence of EBV in ELS-containing 
SS salivary glands was associated with follicular exclusion of CD8+ T cells and 
impaired CD8-mediated cytotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: Active EBV infection is selectively associated with ELS in the 
salivary glands of patients with SS and appears to contribute to local growth 
and differentiation of disease-specific autoreactive B cells.
