Leukotriene B4 acts through its receptors, BLT(1) and BLT(2), however, their 
expression in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. In this experiment, BLT(1) and 
BLT(2) mRNA expressions in the synovium of rats with collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) at days 1, 3, 7 and 14 after CIA onset were analyzed by RT-PCR. The 
expression of two immunological and inflammatory factors, S100A8 and S100A9, in 
the synovium of the arthritic rats was also determined at the indicated time. At 
d14, the differential expressions of BLT(1) and BLT(2) in the synovium, spleen, 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and thymus of CIA rats were analyzed. 
The results showed that, in the synovium of the arthritic rats, the BLT(1) mRNA 
expression increased after CIA onset, reached the highest value between d1 and 
d3, and declined afterwards while the BLT(2) expression increased with time and 
reached its peak at d14. Both S100A8 and S100A9 expression reached the peak 
levels between d1 and d3, and decreased to lower levels between d7 and d14. For 
the analyzed tissues from CIA rats at d14, BLT(1) mRNA was expressed in the 
thymus with the highest level, followed by the spleen, PBMC and synovium. BLT(2) 
mRNA was expressed in the thymus the highest as well, but followed by the 
synovium, spleen and PBMC. Since BLT(1) and BLT(2) play distinct roles during 
CIA, this study may provide basis for new therapies targeting BLT(1) and BLT(2), 
respectively, for the treatment of arthritic inflammation at different stages.
