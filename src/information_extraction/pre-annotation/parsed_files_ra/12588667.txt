As the T-cell population in the synovial tissue (ST) in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) is dominated by T helper (Th) 1 cells, this study was designed to examine 
whether there is a preferential migration of polarized T cells to ST, and to 
identify the chemokines responsible for the migration. This was done by 
developing 10 T-cell clones specific for an arbitrary antigen (mouse 
immunoglobulin G (IgG)) from the peripheral blood (PB) of a healthy donor 
sensitized to mouse IgG. The Th polarizations of the clones were determined by 
measuring secreted interferon-gamma and interleukin-4, following anti-CD3 
stimulation. Migration to pools of RA ST cell-derived supernatants was analysed. 
Expression of the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, 
CCR8, CXCR3 and CXCR4 were analysed by flow cytometry. Th1 clones showed 
significantly higher migration to RA ST cell-derived supernatant compared with 
Th2 clones. Blocking of either of the chemokines, CCL5 or CCL2, strongly 
inhibited migration of the Th1 cells between 56 and 77%, while blocking of 
CXCL12 inhibited migration between 44 and 61%. Blocking of CXCL10 had only a 
minor inhibitory effect. Our results demonstrate a selective migration of Th1 
cells to RA ST supernatant and that blocking either CCL5, CCL2 or CXCL12 
significantly inhibits T-cell migration. This indicates that CCL5, CCL2 and 
CXCL12 play significant roles in attracting Th1 cells towards the RA ST, and may 
prove potent targets for obstructing T-cell migration to the synovium.
