Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology though 
both genetic and environmental factors have been suggested to be involved in its 
pathogenesis. While infections and other environmental factors (e.g. smoking) 
have been studied extensively and show some association, a direct link between 
all the factors has been difficult to prove. With the recent advances in 
technology, it has become possible to sequence the commensals that are residing 
in our gut. The gut microbiome may provide the missing link to this puzzle and 
help solve the mystery of many leaky gut syndromes. The gut commensals are 
involved in maintaining host immune homeostasis and function suggesting that 
they might be critical in altering the immune system, which leads to autoimmune 
diseases like RA. Mouse models support the role of the gut microbiota in 
predisposition to RA. If that is true, the power of gut-derived commensal can be 
harnessed to our benefit by generating a biomarker profile along with genetic 
factors to define individuals at risk and by altering the gut microbial 
composition using various means.
