In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), xianfanghuomingyin (XFHM) is used to 
treat autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we studied 
the mechanisms underlying its treatment effects, especially its 
anti-inflammatory effects in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. We 
found that cartilage destruction and pannus formation were alleviated by 
treatment with XFHM. The abnormal differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells was 
downregulated significantly by XFHM, and Th2 and Treg cells were upregulated. 
Moreover, the expression levels of specific cytokines and transcription factors 
related to Th1 cells (interferon γ [IFNγ], T-bet) and Th17 cells (interleukin- 
[IL-] 17) and the nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan 
receptor-gamma (RORγ) were downregulated. Serum IL-4 and GATA-3, which 
contribute to Th2 cells differentiation, increased significantly after XFHM 
administration. These results indicate that XFHM can restore the balance of T 
lymphocytes and reestablish the immunological tolerance to inhibit 
autoinflammatory disorder of RA. Taken together, XFHM can be used as a 
complementary or alternative traditional medicine to treat RA.
