Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that display 
canonical domain structure with highly conserved DNA-binding and ligand-binding 
domains. The identification of the endogenous ligands for several receptors 
remains elusive or is controversial, and thus these receptors are classified as 
orphans. One such orphan receptor is the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan 
receptor γ (RORγ). An isoform of RORγ, RORγt, has been shown to be essential for 
the expression of Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and the differentiation of Th17 cells. 
Th17 cells have been implicated in the pathology of several autoimmune diseases, 
including multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genetic 
ablation of RORγ alone or in combination with RORα in mice led to impaired Th17 
differentiation and protected the mice from development of experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Here we describe 
SR2211, a selective RORγ modulator that potently inhibits production of IL-17 in 
cells.
