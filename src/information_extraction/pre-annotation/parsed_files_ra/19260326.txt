OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect on the extract of total flavonoids of 
Chrysanthemum indicum (TFC) on adjuvant arthritis synovial cells.
METHOD: SD rats were divided randomly into six groups including normal, model, 
TFC (84, 168, 336 mg x kg(-1)) and control drug Tripterygium glycosides (30 mg x 
kg(-1)) groups. Adjuvant arthritis rat model was induced by a single intradermal 
injection of 0.1 mL of the complete Freund's adjuvant into the right hind feet 
pads of the SD rats. The proliferation of synoviocyte was measured by MT; The 
apoptosis rates of synovial cells were evaluated using TUNEL and FCM analysis.
RESULT: TFC resulted in a dose-dependent way in inhibiting the proliferation of 
synovial and inducing the apoptosis of synovium and synoviocytes in vivo.
CONCLUSION: TFC can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in synovial 
cells, and exert therapeutical effect on rheumatoid arthritis.
