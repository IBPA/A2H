Cytokines that bind to and signal through the gp130 co-receptor subunit include 
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 
cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and ciliary neutrophic factor (CNTF). Apart from 
contributing to inflammation, gp130 signalling cytokines also function in the 
maintenance of bone homeostasis. Expression of each of these cytokines and their 
ligand-specific receptors is observed in bone and joint cells, and bone-active 
hormones and inflammatory cytokines regulate their expression. gp130 signalling 
cytokines have been shown to regulate the differentiation and activity of 
osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes. Furthermore, cytokine and receptor 
specific gene-knockout mouse models have identified distinct roles for each of 
these cytokines in regulating bone resorption, bone formation and bone growth. 
This review will discuss the current models of paracrine and endocrine actions 
of gp130-signalling cytokines in bone remodelling and growth, as well as their 
impact in pathologic bone remodelling evident in periodontal disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, spondylarthropathies and osteoarthritis.
