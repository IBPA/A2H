OBJECTIVE: To observe the antiarthritic effects and the possible mechanism of 
total saponins of Psammruosilene tunicoids (TSPT) against rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
METHOD: After establishing AA rat model, the TSPT'S antiarthritic effects and 
mechanism against RA were studied through observing the changes of ankle 
swelling, arthritis index and levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after medication.
RESULT: TSPT could effectively inhibits articular swelling, decrease arthritis 
index and regulate down the content of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in the 
inflammatory tissue soak of AA rats.
CONCLUSION: TSPT has good antiarthritic effects and the possible mechanism may 
be related to its down-regulation of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha.
