Semecarpus anacardium (SA) Linn. (family Anacardiaceae), is a plant well-known 
for its medicinal value in Ayurveda. The nut extracts of this plant have been 
traditionally used as antihelminthic, anti-fungal, anti-carcinogenic and in the 
treatment of nervous debilities and arthritis. In this study we have evaluated 
crude ethanolic extract of SA nuts for its anti-inflammatory activities in vitro 
using peripheral blood and synovial fluid mononuclear cells of healthy 
individuals and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. SA extract inhibited the 
spontaneous and LPS induced production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and 
IL-12p40 but had no effect on TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, both at protein and 
mRNA level. The crude extract also suppressed LPS induced nuclear translocation 
of transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1; the inhibition of NF-kappaB was 
through the inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. The extract also 
suppressed LPS activated nitric oxide production in mouse macrophage cell line, 
RAW 264.7. Our results for the first time show that SA extract can inhibit 
proinflammatory cytokine production and demonstrate its mechanism of action.
