Auranofin (AF), an orally administered, gold-based, anti-arthritic agent, has 
emerged as a clinically useful therapeutic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis. In the present study, we examined the effects of AF on major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted antigen presentation in dendritic 
cells (DCs), which are the most important accessory cells for the induction of T 
cell responses. A mouse dendritic cell line, DC2.4 cells, and DCs that were 
generated from mouse bone marrow cells by culturing with granulocyte 
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 were each 
pretreated with AF for 2 hr, and then incubated with ovalbumin (OVA). After the 
2-hr incubation, the DCs were fixed, and the amounts of OVA peptide-H-2Kb 
complexes were assessed using OVa-specific CD8+ T cells. AF inhibited MHC class 
I-restricted presentation of exogenous OVA. This inhibitory activity of AF 
appeared to be due not only to the inhibition of the phagocytic activity of DCs, 
but also to the suppression of MHC molecule expression on DCs. AF also inhibited 
MHC class II-restricted presentation of exogenous OVA. These results show that 
AF exerts immunosuppressive activity at least in part by inhibiting 
MHC-restricted antigen presentation in professional antigen-presenting cells.
