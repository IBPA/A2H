OBJECTIVE: The function of mast cells (MCs) in autoimmune disorders has been a 
subject of controversy recently. MC-deficient Kit(W/W-v) mice were found to be 
resistant to K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis, whereas Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice and a 
genetic model of MC deficiency independent of the Kit mutation were found to be 
fully susceptible. This debate might lead to the assumption that MCs are 
dispensable in autoimmunity in general. Thus, the purpose of this study was to 
examine the relevance of MCs to arthritis using a genetic model of inducible MC 
deficiency without compromised Kit signaling.
METHODS: We compared MC functions in K/BxN serum-induced arthritis and in 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a mouse model of inducible MC deficiency by 
analyzing joint inflammation, parameters of cartilage degradation and bone 
erosion, and the autoreactive adaptive immune response.
RESULTS: We observed a redundant role of MCs in K/BxN serum-induced arthritis, 
where joint inflammation is triggered by cartilage-bound immune complexes 
independently of T cells. In contrast, we found MCs to be critically relevant in 
CIA, which is provoked by two arms of autoimmune attack: autoreactive antibodies 
and effector T cells. In addition to diminished joint inflammation in the 
absence of MCs, we found a dramatic loss of T cell expansion upon immunization, 
accompanied by reduced T cell cytokine responses.
CONCLUSION: In this analysis of an arthritis model in which the cellular arm of 
adaptive immunity was not bypassed, we identified MCs as important promoters of 
T cell-conditioned autoimmune disorders and, consequently, as potential 
therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis.
