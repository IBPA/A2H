Rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are useful tools to study the 
pathogenic process of RA. Among the most widely used models of RA are the 
streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis model and the collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). Both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are involved in these rodent 
models. While no models perfectly duplicate the condition of human RA, they are 
easily reproducible, well defined and have proven useful for development of new 
therapies for arthritis, as exemplified by cytokine blockade therapies. Besides 
SCW and CIA models, there are numerous others including transgenic models such 
as K/BxN, induced models such as adjuvant-induced and pristane models, and 
spontaneous models in certain mouse strains, that have been used to help 
understand some of the underlying mechanisms. This review provides an update and 
analysis of RA models in mice and rats. The array of models has provided 
rheumatologists and immunologists a means to understand the multifactorial 
disease in humans, to identify new drug targets, and to test new therapies.
