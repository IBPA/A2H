As an emerging research direction, nanomedicine has been increasingly utilized 
to treat inflammatory diseases. In this head-to-head comparison study, four 
established nanomedicine formulations of dexamethasone, including liposomes 
(L-Dex), core-cross-linked micelles (M-Dex), slow releasing polymeric prodrugs 
(P-Dex-slow), and fast releasing polymeric prodrugs (P-Dex-fast), were evaluated 
in an adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model with an equivalent dose treatment 
design. It was found that after a single i.v. injection, the formulations with 
the slower drug release kinetics (i.e., M-Dex and P-Dex-slow) maintained longer 
duration of therapeutic activity than those with relatively faster drug release 
kinetics, resulting in better joint protection. This finding will be 
instructional in the future development and optimization of nanomedicines for 
the clinical management of rheumatoid arthritis. The outcome of this study also 
illustrates the value of such head-to-head comparison studies in translational 
nanomedicine research.
