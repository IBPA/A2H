AIF has been formulated using three herbs known to have anti-inflammatory and 
anti-osteolytic effects. In this study, the potential therapeutic effects of AIF 
for rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in vitro and in vivo. The effects of AIF 
on the inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-1, iNO), cartilage protection (MMP-13), and 
selective killing of activated T cells were examined, in vitro. In addition, the 
therapeutic effect of AIF was evaluated using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
mouse model. DBA/1 mice were immunized with type II collagen. Following booster 
immunization, mice were treated with the oral administration of 276 mg/kg/d AIF 
once a day for 18 days, then, the severity of CIA was evaluated by macroscopic 
scoring and histopathological assessment. AIF significantly inhibited the 
production of TNF-alpha, IL-1, iNO, and MMP-13 in a dose dependent manner in 
vitro. Also, AIF killed activated T cells selectively, conserving na√Øve T cells. 
The oral administration of AIF in CIA mice suppressed the progression of CIA 
significantly and decreased synovial hyperplasia, cartilage destruction, and 
bone erosion. AIF showed potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and 
substantial protective effect for the progression of CIA in vivo. These results 
suggest that AIF contains effective compound(s) which may modify the progression 
of rheumatoid arthritis.
