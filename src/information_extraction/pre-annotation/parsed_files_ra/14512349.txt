MOTIVATION: DNA microarray technology and the completion of human and mouse 
genome sequencing programs are now offering new avenues for the investigation of 
complex genetic diseases. In particular, this makes possible the study of the 
spatial distribution of disease-related genes within the genome. We report on 
the first systematic search for clustering of genes associated with a polygenic 
autoimmune disease.
RESULTS: Using a set of cDNA microarray chip experiments in two mouse models of 
rheumatoid arthritis, we have identified approximately 200 genes based on their 
expression in inflamed joints and mapped them into the genome. We compute the 
spatial autocorrelation function of the selected genes and find that they tend 
to cluster over scales of a few megabase pairs. We then identify significant 
gene clusters using a friends-of-friends algorithm. This approach should aid in 
discovering functionally related gene clusters in the mammalian genome.
