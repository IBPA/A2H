Activation Induced Cell Death of T helper cells is central to maintaining immune 
homeostasis and a perturbation often manifests in aberrant T helper cells that 
is associated with immunopathologies. Significant presence of T cells positive 
for IL-17A (Th17) and dual positive for IFN-Î³/IL-17A (Th1/Th17) in both effector 
(CD45RA+RO+) and memory (CD45RA-RO+) compartments with differential FasL protein 
in RA peripheral blood suggested their differential TCR AICD sensitivity. 
Lowered active caspase-3 in Th17 and Th1/Th17 over Th1 cells confirmed their 
capability to resist AICD and pointed to early upstream events. Differential 
MAPK activities, FasL protein and downstream caspase-3 activities in murine Th1 
and Th17 cells established distinct TCR mediated signaling pathways and 
suggested low Erk and p38 activity as pivotal for AICD sensitivity. We 
extrapolated our mouse and human data and report that Fas-FasL is the preferred 
death pathway for both Th1 and Th17 and that inherently low Erk2 activity 
protected Th17 cells from TCR AICD. The presence of significantly higher numbers 
of aberrant T helper cells in RA also suggest an inflammatory cytokine milieu 
and AICD insensitive T cell link to sustained inflammation. Re sensitization to 
apoptosis by targeting MAPK activity especially Erk2 in RA might be of 
therapeutic value.
