The dendritic cell immunoreceptor (official gene symbol Clec4a2, called Dcir 
here) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed mainly in dendritic cells (DCs) that 
has a carbohydrate recognition domain in its extracellular portion and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, which transduces negative 
signals into cells, in its cytoplasmic portion. We found high Dcir expression in 
the joints of two mouse rheumatoid arthritis models. Because the structural 
characteristics of Dcir suggest that it may have an immune regulatory role, and 
because autoimmune-related genes are mapped to the DCIR locus in humans, we 
generated Dcir-/- mice to learn more about the pathological roles of this 
molecule. We found that aged Dcir-/- mice spontaneously develop sialadenitis and 
enthesitis associated with elevated serum autoantibodies. Dcir-/- mice showed a 
markedly exacerbated response to collagen-induced arthritis. The DC population 
was expanded excessively in aged and type II collagen-immunized Dcir-/- mice. 
Upon treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Dcir-/- 
mouse-derived bone marrow cells (BMCs) differentiated into DCs more efficiently 
than did wild-type BMCs, owing to enhanced signal transducer and activator of 
transcription-5 phosphorylation. These observations indicate that Dcir is a 
negative regulator of DC expansion and has a crucial role in maintaining the 
homeostasis of the immune system.
