OBJECTIVE: To identify epigenetic factors that are implicated in the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to explore the therapeutic 
potential of the targeted inhibition of these factors.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays were used to investigate the 
expression profile of genes that encode key epigenetic regulator enzymes. 
Mononuclear cells from RA patients and mice were monitored for gene expression 
changes, in association with arthritis development in murine models of RA. 
Selected genes were further characterized by quantitative reverse 
transcription-PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometry methods. The targeted 
inhibition of the up-regulated enzymes was studied in arthritic mice.
RESULTS: A set of genes with arthritis-specific expression was identified by the 
PCR arrays. Aurora kinases A and B, both of which were highly expressed in 
arthritic mice and treatment-naive RA patients, were selected for detailed 
analysis. Elevated aurora kinase expression was accompanied by increased 
phosphorylation of histone H3, which promotes proliferation of T lymphocytes. 
Treatment with VX-680, a pan-aurora kinase inhibitor, promoted B cell apoptosis, 
provided significant protection against disease onset, and attenuated 
inflammatory reactions in arthritic mice.
CONCLUSION: Arthritis development is accompanied by changes in expression of a 
number of epigenome-modifying enzymes. Drug-induced down-regulation of the 
aurora kinases, among other targets, seems to be sufficient to treat 
experimental arthritis. Development of new therapeutics that target aurora 
kinases can potentially improve RA management.
