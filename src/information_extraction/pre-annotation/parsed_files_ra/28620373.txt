Autoantibodies are frequently observed in healthy individuals. In a minority of 
these individuals, they lead to manifestation of autoimmune diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis or Graves' disease. Overall, more than 2.5% of the 
population is affected by autoantibody-driven autoimmune disease. Pathways 
leading to autoantibody-induced pathology greatly differ among different 
diseases, and autoantibodies directed against the same antigen, depending on the 
targeted epitope, can have diverse effects. To foster knowledge in 
autoantibody-induced pathology and to encourage development of urgently needed 
novel therapeutic strategies, we here categorized autoantibodies according to 
their effects. According to our algorithm, autoantibodies can be classified into 
the following categories: (1) mimic receptor stimulation, (2) blocking of neural 
transmission, (3) induction of altered signaling, triggering uncontrolled (4) 
microthrombosis, (5) cell lysis, (6) neutrophil activation, and (7) induction of 
inflammation. These mechanisms in relation to disease, as well as principles of 
autoantibody generation and detection, are reviewed herein.
