OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic regulation of rheumatoid factor (RF) in a 
rat model of rheumatoid arthritis, in order to gain understanding of the 
enigmatic role of RF in the disease.
METHODS: IgM-RF and IgG-RF, as well as total levels of immunoglobulins of 
different subclasses, were measured in sera from rats with pristane-induced 
arthritis (PIA). The major gene regions were identified by linkage analysis of 
genetically segregating crosses.
RESULTS: The production of RF was found to correlate with development of 
arthritis and to be higher in females than in males. Surprisingly, the 
relatively arthritis-resistant E3 strain had higher levels of RF than the 
arthritis-susceptible DA strain. In an (E3 x DA)F(2) cohort a major locus 
controlling the levels of IgM-RF in serum was identified on chromosome 11 (Rf1) 
and another on chromosome 16 (Rf3), and these were not related to arthritis 
susceptibility. However, the Rf2 locus on chromosome 4 controlled IgG-RF levels, 
IgG2a levels, and chronic arthritis in males (Pia5). Some previously defined 
arthritis loci (Pia4, Pia6, Pia7, and Pia8) were found to also control 
immunoglobulin levels in serum.
CONCLUSION: RFs are produced in the rat PIA model and correlate with development 
of arthritis. Gene regions controlling RF and serum immunoglobulin levels were 
identified, of which some cosegregated with arthritis. This suggests a new focus 
of study to elucidate the role of RF in the pathogenesis of arthritis.
