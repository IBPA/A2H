To investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of matrine, a component derived from 
Sophora flavescens in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a rat model of RA 
was established. Compared to control rats, matrine significantly mitigated 
inflammation and severity of RA (paw volume and articular index (AI) score). 
Using either mice splenic T cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin or rat splenic T 
cells, the levels of Th1 and Th2 responses were determined by flow cytometry, 
quantitative RT-PCR, and ELISA. Furthermore, the levels of NF-κBp65 (RelA), 
IκBα, and phosphor-IκBα in T cells were determined by Western blot. Our study 
found that matrine modulated the imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses in 
rats with RA by reducing the levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β), but 
increasing Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-10) through attenuating the NF-κB signaling 
in T cells, suggesting matrine as a promising drug for intervention of RA.
