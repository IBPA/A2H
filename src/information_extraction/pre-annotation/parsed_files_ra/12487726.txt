1. We investigated the hepatobiliary transport of doxorubicin in the isolated 
perfused liver prepared from the adjuvant arthritis rat, an animal model for 
rheumatoid arthritis, to examine the hepatic P-glycoprotein activity in the 
adjuvant arthritis rat. 2. Liver was isolated from the normal and the adjuvant 
arthritis rat and perfused for 60 min with recirculating buffer and the 
perfusate and bile samples were collected at timed interval. 3. The elimination 
of doxorubicin in the adjuvant arthritis rat tended to be reduced, but it was 
not significantly different from the normal rat. Biliary clearance (CL(bile)) in 
the normal rat was 1.93 +/- 0.48 ml min(-1), whereas, CL(bile) in the adjuvant 
arthritis rat was significantly decreased to 0.40 +/- 0.13 ml min(-1). 4. 
CL(bile) was markedly decreased to about 0.15 ml min(-1) in the presence of 100 
microM verapamil in both types of rat. Methotrexate treatment had no effect on 
CL(bile) in both the normal and adjuvant arthritis rat (2.18 +/- 0.22 and 0.47 
+/- 0.22 ml min(-1), respectively). 5. The results suggest that the hepatic 
P-glycoprotein activity was markedly decreased in the adjuvant arthritis rat and 
the effect of methotrexate on the hepatic P-glycoprotein activity did not 
corresponded to its anti-inflammatory effect.
