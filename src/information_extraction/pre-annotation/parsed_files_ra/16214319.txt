Animal models are instrumental in understanding the etiology and pathogenetic 
mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis. Several new mouse models have either been 
produced, including transgenics, gene-knockouts, and gene knock-ins, or 
established as a spontaneous disease due to natural gene mutations. These models 
are suitable for addressing the roles of T cells, autoantibodies, cytokines and 
innate immunity in the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. In 
particular, they now provide insights into how systemic alterations of the 
immune system result in a local development of chronic arthritis that leads to 
joint destruction.
