Neurotropin((R)), a non-protein extract from the inflamed skin of rabbits 
inoculated with vaccinia virus, has been clinically used as an analgesic drug 
for treatment of chronic pain. In this study, we investigated the analgesic 
mechanisms of Neurotropin in the adjuvant-induced arthritic rat, a chronic pain 
model with inflammation. Neurotropin caused dose-dependent inhibition of 
hyperalgesia in the adjuvant-induced arthritic rat after single intravenous (10 
- 100 NU/kg) and oral (30 - 200 NU/kg) administration. The analgesic effect of 
Neurotropin (intravenous 100 NU/kg and oral 200 NU/kg) was significantly 
inhibited by intrathecal injections of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist 
yohimbine (30 nmol/animal) and the selective 5-HT(3) serotonin receptor 
antagonist MDL72222 (30 nmol/animal), and slightly inhibited by the 
non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist methysergide (100 nmol/animal). The 
results suggest that the analgesic action of Neurotropin is at least in part due 
to the enhancement of noradrenergic and serotonergic descending pain inhibitory 
pathways. Neurotropin may be useful for the clinical management of chronic pain 
diseases such as a rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
