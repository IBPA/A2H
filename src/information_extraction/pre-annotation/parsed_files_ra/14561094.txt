Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, 
remain major health problems worldwide. We previously demonstrated that 
adenosine kinase inhibitors (AKIs) exhibit antiinflammatory effects by 
inhibiting TNF-alpha production, neutrophil accumulation, and edema formation. 
Although adenosine receptor agonists produce similar effects, AKIs showed the 
antiinflammatory activity without the cardiovascular side effects that prevented 
the development of adenosine receptor specific agonists. However, previously 
described potent AKIs, such as 5-iodotubercidin, are nucleosides which have the 
potential to undergo in vivo 5'-O-phosphorylation and therefore produce 
cytotoxicity. In an effort to eliminate toxicities produced by phosphorylated 
nucleosides, l-lyxofuranosyl analogues of tubercidin were tested as potential 
AKIs since the opposite stereochemical orientation of the CH(2)OH was expected 
to eliminate intracellular phosphorylation. Described herein are the discovery 
of a new series of AKIs based on alpha-l-lyxofuranosyl nucleosides, their SAR, 
as well as the antiinflammatory activity of the lead compound GP790 (IC(50) = 
0.47 nM, 47% inhibition of paw swelling at 10 mg/kg in rat carrageenan paw edema 
model). In addition, a study showing that in the skin lesion model the 
antiinflammatory activity is reversed by an A2 selective adenosine receptor 
antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargyl xanthine [correction of propylxanthine] 
(DMPX) is also described.
