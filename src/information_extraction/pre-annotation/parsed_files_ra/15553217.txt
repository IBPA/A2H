PURPOSE: To study the accumulation of macromolecules into the arthritic joints 
and the possible applications of such phenomenon.
METHODS: The accumulation of plasma albumin in the joints of adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AIA) rat model was first visualized with Evans blue injection. A 
N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer contrast agent was then 
synthesized and injected into the AIA rats to allow qualitative examination of 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the injected macromolecule with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). Vital organs and the diseased joints were isolated and 
examined histologically to correlate with the MRI findings.
RESULTS: Deep blue color developed around the arthritic joints of the AIA rat a 
few hours after the injection of Evans blue. MR imaging of the AIA rats injected 
with polymer contrast agent demonstrated a gradual but very strong accumulation 
of the injected polymer in the arthritic joints, which lasted for 1-2 days. 
Observed differences in the concentration of the injected polymer in the joints 
correlated with disease severity as assessed histologically.
CONCLUSIONS: Profound arthrotropism of macromolecules in the AIA rat model was 
demonstrated with various imaging tools. These observations should help in the 
conceptual and practical design of novel macromolecular delivery systems for the 
imaging and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
