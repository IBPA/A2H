Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, targets JAK1, JAK3, and to a lesser extent JAK2 and TYK2. JAK1/3 
inhibition impairs gamma common chain cytokine receptor signaling, important in 
lymphocyte development, homeostasis and function. Adult and juvenile cynomolgus 
monkey and rat studies were conducted and the impact of tofacitinib on immune 
parameters (lymphoid tissues and lymphocyte subsets) and function (T-dependent 
antibody response (TDAR), mitogen-induced T cell proliferation) assessed. 
Tofacitinib administration decreased circulating T cells and NK cells in 
juvenile and adult animals of both species. B cell decreases were observed only 
in rats. These changes and decreased lymphoid tissue cellularity are consistent 
with the expected pharmacology of tofacitinib. No differences were observed 
between juvenile and adult animals, either in terms of doses at which effects 
were observed or differential effects on immune endpoints. Lymphomas were 
observed in three adult monkeys. Tofacitinib impaired the primary TDAR in 
juvenile monkeys, although a recall response was generated. Complete or partial 
reversal of the effects on the immune system was observed.
