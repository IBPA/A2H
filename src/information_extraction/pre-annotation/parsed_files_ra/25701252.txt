SAR studies focused on improving the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the 
previously reported potent and selective Btk inhibitor CGI-1746 (1) resulted in 
the clinical candidate GDC-0834 (2), which retained the potency and selectivity 
of CGI-1746, but with much improved PK in preclinical animal models. Structure 
based design efforts drove this work as modifications to 1 were investigated at 
both the solvent exposed region as well as 'H3 binding pocket'. However, in 
vitro metabolic evaluation of 2 revealed a non CYP-mediated metabolic process 
that was more prevalent in human than preclinical species (mouse, rat, dog, 
cyno), leading to a high-level of uncertainly in predicting human 
pharmacokinetics. Due to its promising potency, selectivity, and preclinical 
efficacy, a single dose IND was filed and 2 was taken in to a single dose phase 
I trial in healthy volunteers to quickly evaluate the human pharmacokinetics. In 
human, 2 was found to be highly labile at the exo-cyclic amide bond that links 
the tetrahydrobenzothiophene moiety to the central aniline ring, resulting in 
insufficient parent drug exposure. This information informed the back-up program 
and discovery of improved inhibitors.
