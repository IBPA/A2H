Antibodies against citrullinated proteins are specific and predictive markers 
for rheumatoid arthritis although the pathologic relevance of these antibodies 
remains unclear. To investigate the significance of these autoantibodies, 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice was used to establish an animal model 
of antibody reactivity to citrullinated proteins. DBA/1J mice were immunized 
with bovine type II collagen (CII) at days 0 and 21, and serum was collected 
every 7 days for analysis. Antibodies against both CII and cyclic citrullinated 
peptide, one such citrullinated antigen, appeared early after immunization, 
before joint swelling was observed. Further, these antibodies demonstrated 
specific binding to citrullinated filaggrin in rat esophagus by indirect 
immunofluorescence and citrullinated fibrinogen by Western blot. To evaluate the 
role of immune responses to citrullinated proteins in CIA, mice were tolerized 
with a citrulline-containing peptide, followed by antigen challenge with CII. 
Tolerized mice demonstrated significantly reduced disease severity and incidence 
compared with controls. We also identified novel murine monoclonal antibodies 
specific to citrullinated fibrinogen that enhanced arthritis when coadministered 
with a submaximal dose of anti-CII antibodies and bound targets within the 
inflamed synovium of mice with CIA. These results demonstrate that antibodies 
against citrullinated proteins are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune arthritis.
