Cancer Osaka thyroid (COT) kinase is an important regulator of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in macrophages. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of COT should be a 
valid approach to therapeutically intervene in the pathogenesis of 
macrophage-driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. We report 
the discovery and chemical optimization of a novel series of COT kinase 
inhibitors, with unprecedented nanomolar potency for the inhibition of TNFÎ±. 
Pharmacological profiling in vivo revealed a high metabolism of these compounds 
in rats which was demonstrated to be predominantly attributed to aldehyde 
oxidase. Due to the very low activity of hepatic AO in the dog, the selected 
candidate 32 displayed significant blood exposure in dogs which resulted in a 
clear prevention of inflammation-driven lameness. Taken together, the described 
compounds both potently and selectively inhibit COT kinase in primary human 
cells and ameliorate inflammatory pathologies in vivo, supporting the notion 
that COT is an appropriate therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
