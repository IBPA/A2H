Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with a worldwide 
distribution and considerable mortality and morbidity. Although the pathogenesis 
of this disease remains elusive, over-reactive dendritic cells (DCs) play a 
critical role in the disease development. It has been shown that human alpha-1 
antitrypsin (hAAT) has protective effects in type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid 
arthritis mouse models. In the present study, we tested the effect of AAT on DC 
differentiation and functions, as well as its protective effect in a lupus-prone 
mouse model. We showed that hAAT treatment significantly inhibited LPS (TLR4 
agonist) and CpG (TLR9 agonist) -induced bone-marrow (BM)-derived conventional 
and plasmacytoid DC (cDC and pDC) activation and reduced the production of 
inflammatory cytokines including IFN-I, TNF-α and IL-1β. In MRL/lpr mice, hAAT 
treatment significantly reduced BM-derived DC differentiation, serum 
autoantibody levels, and importantly attenuated renal pathology. Our results for 
the first time demonstrate that hAAT inhibits DC activation and function, and it 
also attenuates autoimmunity and renal damage in the MRL/lpr lupus model. These 
results imply that hAAT has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of SLE in 
humans.
