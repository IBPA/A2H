Angiogenesis is observed in many diseases, such as tumor progression, diabetes 
and rheumatoid arthritis; it is a process that involves proliferation, 
migration, differentiation and tube formation of endothelial cells. Vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in angiogenesis by 
induction of these endothelial functions. Thus, inhibition of these critical 
angiogenic steps is a practical therapeutic strategy for those diseases. NP-184 
is a substituted benzimidazole analogue which exhibits a potent anti-thrombotic 
activity. In this report, NP-184 inhibited the viability of human umbilical 
vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a concentration-dependent manner, and 
caused cell apoptosis as examined by cell-cycle analysis and Annexin V staining 
with flow cytometry. NP-184 also concentration-dependently inhibited the HUVEC 
migration, tube formation on Matrigel, and rat aortic ring sprouting stimulated 
by VEGF. Regarding the intracellular signal transduction, NP-184 
concentration-dependently interfered with the activation of AKT, ERK and the 
nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. In vivo study showed that NP-184 
dose-dependently reduced angiogenesis in Matrigel plug assay. These results 
indicate that NP-184 is a potential candidate for developing the treatment of 
angiogenesis related-diseases.
