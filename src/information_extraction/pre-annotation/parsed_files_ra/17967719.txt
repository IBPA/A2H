The purpose of this review is to summarize the role that murine models of 
arthritis are playing in the understanding of human rheumatoid arthritis and how 
leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is emerging as an important target in this field. Both 
the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and the K/BxN serum transfer 
arthritis model have contributed to outline the potential mechanisms involved in 
inflammatory arthritis. Indeed, the CIA model has contributed to the development 
of effective anti-TNFalpha and anti-IL-1beta based treatments for RA that are 
currently in the clinic. Many recent studies in mouse models have suggested a 
critical role for LTB(4) and its receptors in the development of inflammatory 
arthritis. Inhibitors of LTB(4) biosynthesis as well as LTB(4) receptors are 
protective in mouse models of RA and mice deficient in the LTB(4) biosynthetic 
enzymes or LTB(4) receptors are resistant to disease development suggesting 
several promising targets for RA in this pathway.
