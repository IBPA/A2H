The complexity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis makes combined blockade 
of multiple targets an attractive therapeutic strategy. The combination therapy 
with anti-TNF plus anti-T-cell has been mostly reported to provide greater 
efficacy than anti-TNF alone. TNFR (p75)-Fc fusion protein, which has been 
proven effective in clinics, is chosen as the TNF antagonist in this study. 
CTLA4-FasL fusion molecule, which has been well characterized in our previous 
studies for its suppressive effect in rat arthritis model, is chosen as the 
T-cell antagonist. In this study, furin cleavage site and 2A self-processing 
sequence were introduced to link upstream TNFR-Fc and downstream CTLA4-FasL and 
mediate separate coexpression of the two fusion proteins in a single recombinant 
adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector. Using this expression system, we generated 
two fusion proteins with same size as their individual counterparts in vitro and 
in vivo, and the proteins desirably retained their parent biological activities. 
In vivo results demonstrated that furin-2A technology is able to regulate 
separate coexpression of these proteins under arthritic inflammatory conditions. 
This study describes a single rAAV vector for production of two antiarthritic 
molecules antagonizing both TNF and T cells, which may serve as an attractive 
expression system for RA gene therapy.
