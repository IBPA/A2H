Hybrid liposomes (HLs) can be prepared by simply sonicating a mixture of 
vesicular and micellar molecules in buffer solutions. This study aims to 
demonstrate inhibitory effects of HLs on the growth of fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes along with apoptosis and therapeutic effects of HLs in a mouse 
model with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). HLs composed of 95 mol% 
L-Î±-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 5 mol% polyoxyethylene(23)dodecyl 
ether (C12(EO)23) were prepared by the sonication method. The inhibitory effects 
of HLs on the growth of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes-RA (HFLS-RA) cells in 
vitro and their inhibitory mechanism were examined. High inhibitory effects of 
HLs on the growth of HFLS-RA cells were observed. The induction of apoptosis by 
HLs was revealed on the basis of flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, 
therapeutic effects of HLs in the mouse model with RA were examined in vivo. Our 
results demonstrate that HLs showed inhibitory effects on the growth of HFLS-RA 
cells in vitro along with apoptosis and therapeutic effects in mouse models of 
RA in vivo.
