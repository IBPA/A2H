Description of the molecular phenotypes of pathobiological processes in vivo is 
a pressing need in genomic biology. We have implemented a high-throughput 
real-time PCR strategy to establish quantitative expression profiles of a 
customized set of target genes. It enables rapid, reproducible data acquisition 
from limited quantities of RNA, permitting serial sampling of mouse blood during 
disease progression. We developed an easy to use statistical algorithm--Global 
Pattern Recognition--to readily identify genes whose expression has changed 
significantly from healthy baseline profiles. This approach provides unique 
molecular signatures for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
graft versus host disease, and can also be applied to defining the molecular 
phenotype of a variety of other normal and pathological processes.
