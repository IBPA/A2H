Recent advances in immunotherapeutics have not yet changed the routine 
management of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. There is an opportunity to repurpose 
therapeutics used to treat other diseases to treat type 1 diabetes, especially 
when there is evidence for overlapping mechanisms. Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 
inhibitors are in development or clinical use for indications including 
rheumatoid arthritis. There is good evidence for activation of the JAK1/JAK2 and 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 pathway in human type 
1 diabetes and in mouse models, especially in β-cells. We tested the hypothesis 
that using these drugs to block the JAK-STAT pathway would prevent autoimmune 
diabetes. The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 blocked the effect of cytokines on 
mouse and human β-cells by inhibiting MHC class I upregulation. This prevented 
the direct interaction between CD8+ T cells and β-cells, and reduced immune cell 
infiltration into islets. NOD mice treated with AZD1480 were protected from 
autoimmune diabetes, and diabetes was reversed in newly diagnosed NOD mice. This 
provides mechanistic groundwork for repurposing clinically approved JAK1/JAK2 
inhibitors for type 1 diabetes.
