BACKGROUND: The role of endogenous glucocorticoids (GC) in the initiation and 
maintenance of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unclear. We demonstrated 
previously that disruption of GC signalling in osteoblasts results in a profound 
attenuation of K/BxN serum-induced arthritis, a mouse model of RA. To determine 
whether or not the modulation of the inflammatory response by osteoblasts 
involves T cells, we studied the effects of disrupted osteoblastic GC-signalling 
in the T cell-dependent model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA).
METHODS: Acute arthritis was induced in pre-immunised 11-week-old male 
11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 transgenic (tg) mice and their wild-type 
(WT) littermates by intra-articular injection of methylated bovine serum 
albumine (mBSA) into one knee joint. Knee diameter was measured every 1-2 days 
until euthanasia on day 14 post injection. In a separate experiment, arthritis 
was maintained for 28 days by weekly reinjections of mBSA. Tissues were analysed 
by histology, histomorphometry and microfocal-computed tomography. Serum 
cytokines levels were determined by multiplex suspension array.
RESULTS: In both short and long term experiments, arthritis developed in tg and 
WT mice with no significant difference between both groups. Histological indices 
of inflammation, cartilage damage and bone erosion were similar in tg and WT 
mice. Bone volume and turnover at the contralateral tibia and systemic cytokine 
levels were not different.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute murine AIA is not affected by a disruption in osteoblastic GC 
signalling. These data indicate that osteoblasts do not modulate the T 
cell-mediated inflammatory response via a GC-dependent pathway.
