Interference with the effects of neuropeptides may be of potential therapeutic 
value for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two neuropeptides that can 
be discussed in this context are bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (BN/GRP) and 
substance P (SP). In order to obtain new information on the possible importance 
of these two peptides, the patterns of immunohistochemical expression of BN/GRP 
and SP and their related receptors in the mouse knee joint from healthy and 
arthritic mice were examined. Positive staining for GRP receptor and the SP 
preferred receptor (the neurokinin-1 receptor [NK-1 R]) was observed in 
articular chondrocytes. On the whole, there was a decrease in immunoreactions 
for both the GRP- and the NK-1 receptors in the articular chondrocytes in joints 
exhibiting severe arthritis. Staining for BN/GRP and GRP receptor was seen in 
the inflammatory infiltrates of the arthritic joints. New evidence for the 
occurrence of marked effects of BN/GRP concerning both the articular 
chondrocytes and the inflammatory process is obtained in this study. With these 
findings and previous observations of neuropeptide expression patterns and 
functions we discuss the possibility that interventions with the effects of 
BN/GRP, SP, and other neuropeptides might be worthwhile in RA.
