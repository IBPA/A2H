Sialylated forms of the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G, produced by the human 
alpha2-6 sialyltransferase ST6Gal-I, were identified as potent anti-inflammatory 
mediators in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis and are potentially the 
active components in intravenous IgG anti-inflammatory therapies. The activities 
and specificities of hST6Gal-I are, however, poorly characterized. Here MS and 
NMR methodology demonstrates glycan modification occurs in a branch-specific 
manner with the alpha1-3Man branch of the complex, biantennary Fc glycan 
preferentially sialylated. Interestingly, this substrate preference is preserved 
when using a released glycan, suggesting that the apparent occlusion of glycan 
termini in Fc crystal structures does not dominate specificity.
