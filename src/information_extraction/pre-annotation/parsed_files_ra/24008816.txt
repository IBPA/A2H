OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the anti-inflammatory activity 
of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), alone and in combination with eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA), in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis, collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: The CIA was induced in DBA/1OlaHsd mice by the injection of bovine type 
II collagen in Freunds's complete adjuvant on days 0 and 21. Mice were fed 
modified diets containing DHA and/or EPA for 4 weeks prior to the initial 
collagen injection until study termination at day 45. The severity of CIA was 
assessed by measuring erythema, edema and mobility of the digits on the fore and 
hind paws, as well as histology. The level of serum anti-collagen antibodies was 
determined by ELISA. The ex vivo effects of DHA and/or EPA on splenocyte 
proliferation and cytokine production were evaluated by BrdU method and ELISA.
RESULTS: Prophylactic treatment with DHA, and not DHA/EPA, significantly reduced 
arthritis severity and joint damage. Treatment with DHA also decreased 
anti-collagen (CII) antibodies in vivo, downregulated interleukin-1β, 
interferonγ and upregulated protective interleukin-10 ex vivo.
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with DHA was efficacious in a mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis and may be a useful intervention strategy against 
inflammatory arthritis.
