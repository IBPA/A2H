Rituximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody, which binds to the CD20 
antigen on B lymphocytes and causes depletion of CD20+ cells. Rituximab is 
currently registered for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Rituximab also demonstrated 
efficacy in a number of other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus 
erythematosus. Data available from over published 200 cases may indicate that 
50-75% of patients with lupus achieve at least partial remission after rituximab 
therapy. This effect was not confirmed in a randomized, double-blind phase 
II/III clinical trial. However methodological inaccuracies which might have led 
to incorrect conclusions in this trial were pointed out. Further studies are 
needed to evaluate efficacy of rituximab in different clinical and immunological 
subtypes of systemic lupus erythematosus.
