Human-SCID grafting is a commonly used technique for the long-term investigation 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) explants. To establish a chimeric immunological 
system in NOD/SCID mice, RA patient-derived pannus tissue from the synovial 
membrane, articular cartilage, and bone can be transplanted subcutaneously. The 
same patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cell chimerism can be 
successfully achieved by intraperitoneal engraftment. This xenograft model is 
able to be used for initial screening of human target-specified biologics.
