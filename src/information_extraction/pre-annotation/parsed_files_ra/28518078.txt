This paper describes a non-invasive method for imaging matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMP)-activity by an activatable fluorescent probe, via in vivo fluorescence 
optical imaging (OI), in two different mouse models of inflammation: a 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a contact hypersensitivity reaction (CHR) model. 
Light with a wavelength in the near infrared (NIR) window (650 - 950 nm) allows 
a deeper tissue penetration and minimal signal absorption compared to 
wavelengths below 650 nm. The major advantages using fluorescence OI is that it 
is cheap, fast and easy to implement in different animal models. Activatable 
fluorescent probes are optically silent in their inactivated states, but become 
highly fluorescent when activated by a protease. Activated MMPs lead to tissue 
destruction and play an important role for disease progression in delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reactions (DTHRs) such as RA and CHR. Furthermore, MMPs are the 
key proteases for cartilage and bone degradation and are induced by macrophages, 
fibroblasts and chondrocytes in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we 
use a probe that is activated by the key MMPs like MMP-2, -3, -9 and -13 and 
describe an imaging protocol for near infrared fluorescence OI of MMP activity 
in RA and control mice 6 days after disease induction as well as in mice with 
acute (1x challenge) and chronic (5x challenge) CHR on the right ear compared to 
healthy ears.
