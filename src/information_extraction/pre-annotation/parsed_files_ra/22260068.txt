IL-17 Receptor D (IL-17 RD) is a cytokine receptor that mediates IL-17 signaling 
and plays an important role in responding to the invasion of extracellular 
pathogens and many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. In this study we report the generation of a mouse monoclonal antibody 
against human IL-17 RD. The recombinant human IL-17RD extracellular domain 
(hIL-17RD-ECD) was produced in the baculovirus expression system and purified 
from culture medium of sf9 insect cells. The purified protein was used as a 
T-dependent antigen to immune Balb/C mice. B cells from the spleen of immunized 
mice were fused with murine cell SP2/0. Hybridoma cell lines were screened for 
the production of the monoclonal antibody against hIL-17-RD-ECD using ELISA. A 
hybridoma cell line 1F8 was found to have a high production of the antibody, 
which was further confirmed for the specificity by both western blot and ELISA 
analyses. The monoclonal antibody obtained from hybridoma 1F8 was characterized 
to be IgG1+Kappa subclass. This study provided a base for the further 
therapeutic application of the antibody on the autoimmune disease including 
rheumatoid arthritis.
