In vivo mouse models of inflammatory arthritis are extensively used to 
investigate pathogenic mechanisms governing inflammation-driven joint damage. 
Two commonly utilized models include collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and 
methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). These 
offer unique advantages for modeling different aspects of human disease. CIA 
involves breach of immunological tolerance resulting in systemic 
autoantibody-driven arthritis, while AIA results in local resolving inflammatory 
flares and articular T cell-mediated damage. Despite limitations that apply to 
all animal models of human disease, CIA and AIA have been instrumental in 
identifying pathogenic mediators, immune cell subsets and stromal cell responses 
that determine disease onset, progression, and severity. Moreover, these models 
have enabled investigation of disease phases not easily studied in patients and 
have served as testing beds for novel biological therapies, including cytokine 
blockers and small molecule inhibitors of intracellular signaling that have 
revolutionized rheumatoid arthritis treatment.
