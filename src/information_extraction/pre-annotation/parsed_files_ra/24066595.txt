OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of pulchinenoside (PULC) in modulating SFRP2 
expression in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
model rats.
METHOD: The effect of PULC in treating RA rats was evaluated by rat arthritis 
score and paw swelling score. The inhibitory effect of PULC on FLS proliferation 
was detected by MTT reagent. The effects of PULC gavage treatment in modulating 
gene expression of FLS SFRP2, critical gene beta-catenin of Wnt pathway and 
downstream effector genes C-myc of of Wnt pathway were detected by RT-PCR and 
Western blotting.
RESULT: PULC had a significant effect in treating RA rats and that SFRP2 
expression was down-regulated in FLS. After PULC gavage treatment, FLS SFRP2 
expression was obviously up-regulated, whereas beta-catenin and C-myc gene 
expressions were significantly down-regulated.
CONCLUSION: PULC can inhibit abnormal proliferation of synovial membrane by 
modulating Wnt pathway of RA rats.
