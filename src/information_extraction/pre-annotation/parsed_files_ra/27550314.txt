BACKGROUND: Excessive osteoclast activity is a major cause of metabolic bone 
disorders, such as osteopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Thus, 
discovery of agents targeting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption is 
important for development of novel treatments for bone diseases. It has been 
demonstrated that ethanolic extract of schizonepeta tenuifolia (EEST) has potent 
anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the beneficial effects 
of EEST on bone metabolism have not been studied. Therefore, we intend to 
investigate the effects of EEST on osteoclast differentiation.
METHODS: We examined the effects and mechanisms of action of the EEST on 
osteoclastogenesis in vitro in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) stimulated with 
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and in vivo using a 
mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone destruction.
RESULTS: We found that EEST inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and IkB at early 
stages of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, EEST negatively 
controlled the transcription and translation levels of nuclear factor of 
activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and the translation level of c-Fos at the final 
stage of osteoclast differentiation. Reflecting these effects, EEST blocked both 
filamentous actin (F-actin) ring formation and bone resorbing activity of mature 
osteoclasts in vitro. The inhibitory effects of EEST on osteoclast formation and 
activity were observed in an LPS-mediated bone erosion mouse model using 
micro-CT and histological analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: EEST is a potential agent that is able to treat osteoclast-related 
bone diseases, such as osteoporosis.
