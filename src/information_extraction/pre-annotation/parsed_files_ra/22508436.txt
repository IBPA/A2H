OBJECTIVE: The goal of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment is to achieve 
clinical remission in order to limit structural damage and physical disability. 
To this end, recent emphasis has been placed on aggressive treatment early in 
the course of disease with drugs such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) 
agents. As T cells are also thought to play an important role in the initiation 
of RA, we hypothesized that targeting both TNF and T cells would result in 
better outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of combined 
therapy with anti-CD3 and anti-TNF in experimental RA.
METHODS: Two anti-mouse antibodies were developed as surrogate reagents for 
anti-TNF and anti-CD3 therapies. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in 
DBA/1 mice, and antibodies were injected intraperitoneally, either alone on in 
combination, at predetermined subtherapeutic doses. The frequency and number of 
pathogenic and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets in the draining lymph nodes were 
determined in order to investigate the mechanisms of action.
RESULTS: Strikingly, the combination of the two antibodies demonstrated a potent 
synergy in established CIA, with long-term inhibition of disease progression and 
protection from joint destruction. The results did not demonstrate any 
enhancement of CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, but a profound depletion of 
pathogenic T cells from the draining lymph nodes was associated with reduced 
numbers of T cells in the joints.
CONCLUSION: A short course of combination therapy with anti-CD3 and anti-TNF 
efficiently depletes pathogenic T cells from the draining lymph nodes, reducing 
the numbers of T cells in the joints and affording long-lasting inhibition of 
established CIA.
