BACKGROUND: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has shown a promising effect in 
ameliorating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this 
investigation was to compare the early and late anti-inflammatory effects of 
LLLT and betamethasone in RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this animal experimental study, after inducing a model 
of RA in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of 37 Wistar rats using adjuvant 
injection, they were randomly distributed into three experimental groups of 12 
animals each: (1) LLLT group; (2) steroid group which received a single dose of 
betamethasone systemically; and (3) positive control group, which did not 
receive any treatment. One rat served as the negative control. Half of the 
animals in all the experimental groups were sacrificed on the 21(st) day after 
RA induction (early phase), and the other half were sacrificed 2 weeks later 
(late phase). Then, the severity of TMJ inflammation was assessed histologically 
in each group on a semi-quantitative scale. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney 
tests were used to compare differences (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: The LLLT and steroid groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower 
inflammation mean scores in both early (5.66 [±1.86] and 1.66 [±1.21], 
respectively) and late phases of evaluation (1.16 [±1.47] and 6.50 [±1.04], 
respectively) compared to positive control group in early and late stages of 
assessment (11.66 [±3.50] and 8.66 [±1.36], respectively). However, the best 
results (P < 0.005) were achieved in early phase of the steroid group as well as 
late phase of the LLLT group.
CONCLUSION: Within limitations of this study, it may be concluded that LLLT 
method has a long-term promising effect on reducing inflammation severity of TMJ 
similar to betamethasone in earlier stages.
