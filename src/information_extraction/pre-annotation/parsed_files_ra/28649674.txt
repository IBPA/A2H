Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by synovial joint inflammation and by 
development of pathogenic humoral and cellular autoimmunity to citrullinated 
proteins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a source of citrullinated 
autoantigens and activate RA synovial fibroblasts (FLS), cells crucial in joint 
damage. We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NETs promote 
proinflammatory phenotypes in FLS, and whether these interactions generate 
pathogenic anti-citrulline adaptive immune responses. NETs containing 
citrullinated peptides are internalized by FLS through a RAGE-TLR9 pathway 
promoting FLS inflammatory phenotype and their upregulation of MHC class II. 
Once internalized, arthritogenic NET-peptides are loaded into FLS MHC class II 
and presented to Ag-specific T cells. HLADRB1*0401 transgenic mice immunized 
with mouse FLS loaded with NETs develop antibodies specific to citrullinated 
forms of relevant RA autoantigens implicated in RA pathogenesis as well as 
cartilage damage. These results implicate FLS as mediators in RA pathogenesis, 
through the internalization and presentation of NET citrullinated peptides to 
the adaptive immune system leading to pathogenic autoimmunity and cartilage 
damage.
