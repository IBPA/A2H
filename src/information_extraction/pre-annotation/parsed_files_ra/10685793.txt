OBJECTIVE: To determine if the procatabolic activity of inflammatory synovial 
fluids (SF) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) could be attenuated by 
the cytokine antagonists murine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) binding protein 
(mLBP) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).
METHODS: Pig articular cartilage explants were cultured in the presence of 
either 20% v/v rheumatoid (RA) or osteoarthritic (OA) SF and varying 
concentrations of either mLBP and/or IL-1ra. The catabolic activity of the SF 
and the relative effects of mLBP and/or IL-1ra were assessed by determining the 
percentage release of sulfated glycosaminoglycans from cartilage explants. LIF 
concentrations were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: RA SF but not OA SF stimulated release of proteoglycans from pig 
cartilage explants in vitro (47.3 +/- 2.2% vs 24.6 +/- 2.0%; p < 0.0001). Murine 
LBP at 100 ng/ml and recombinant human (rh) IL-1ra at 5000 ng/ml produced a dose 
dependent inhibition of this proteoglycan release (p < 0.0067 and p < 0.0111, 
respectively). The RA SF stimulated proteoglycan release was attenuated by mLBP 
and rhIL-1ra independently. No additive effect of this attenuation was observed 
when maximal inhibitory doses were used in combination. The decrease in 
proteoglycan release produced by mLBP correlated significantly with LIF 
concentrations in RA SF.
CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with the concept that IL-1 stimulates 
cartilage proteoglycan resorption in RA. They also support the hypothesis that 
LIF, too, contributes to cartilage proteoglycan resorption in RA. The residual 
stimulation not accounted for by IL-1 or LIF suggests other cytokines may 
contribute. The role of LIF and related or unrelated cytokines may need to be 
taken into account to optimize chondroprotection in RA and other rheumatic 
diseases.
