Macrophages phagocytose cells that die during programmed cell death and the 
nuclei that are expelled from erythroid precursor cells during erythropoiesis; 
subsequently, the ingested DNA is degraded in their lysosomes. A defect in this 
lysosomal DNA degradation activates the macrophages to produce cytokines such as 
IFNbeta and TNFalpha in a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent manner. IFNbeta 
thus produced in the mouse fetus induces the apoptosis of erythroid and lymphoid 
precursor cells, and kills the embryos. On the other hand, when the capacity for 
lysosomal DNA degradation is knocked out after birth, TNFalpha production 
increases in adulthood, causing chronic polyarthritis that resembles human 
rheumatoid arthritis. Here, I summarize recent findings on inflammatory diseases 
induced by such defects in DNA degradation.
