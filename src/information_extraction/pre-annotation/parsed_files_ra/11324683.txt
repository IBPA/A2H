MHC class II alleles have been linked to several human autoimmune diseases such 
as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Although the mechanisms by which expression of certain MHC class II molecules 
predispose an individual to a particular autoimmune disease are not known, it is 
clear that increased susceptibility is associated with the polymorphic regions 
unique to these predisposing HLA alleles. These polymorphic differences may 
influence susceptibility by selecting potential autoreactive T cells during 
thymic education. Alternatively, nonsusceptible alleles may either delete or 
fail to select these potential autoimmune T cells, thus reducing the possibility 
of developing disease. In the periphery, the unique specificity of the HLA 
molecule derived from a susceptible allele may then recognize and present an 
autoantigenic peptide or foreign peptide that may cross-react with an 
autoantigen, activating these autoreactive T cells and leading to disease. To 
dissect these possibilities and to determine the exact role of particular HLA-DR 
or DQ molecules in disease susceptibility, we have generated several lines of 
HLA-DR and DQ transgenic mice. In this review, we present data summarizing the 
functions of these HLA class II molecules using well-established mouse models 
for autoimmune diseases.
