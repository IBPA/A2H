Synovial cells in the rheumatoid synovium show abnormal proliferation, leading 
to joint destruction. Rheumatoid synovial cells express functional Fas antigen 
and are susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis. We have proposed the induction of 
apoptosis by Fas/Fas ligand system of proliferative rheumatoid synovium as a 
novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have recently reported that 
Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) plays a key role in Fas-mediated 
apoptosis of synovial cells in patients with RA. In this study, we determined 
whether FADD gene transfer could induce apoptosis of RA synoviocytes in vitro 
and in vivo. Transfection of FADD gene by adenoviral vector into cultured RA 
synoviocytes induced up-regulation of FADD expression and apoptosis. In 
addition, local injection of FADD adenovirus (Ad-FADD) eliminated synoviocytes 
in vivo by induction of apoptosis of proliferating human rheumatoid synovium 
engrafted in severe combined immunodeficiency mouse, which is the most suitable 
animal model of RA for the evaluation of treatment strategy in vivo. In 
addition, Ad-FADD-induced apoptosis was limited to cells of the synovium tissue 
and did not affect chondrocytes. Our results strongly suggest that FADD gene 
transfer can induce apoptosis of RA synoviocytes both in vitro and in vivo, 
suggesting that FADD gene transfer might be effective in the treatment of RA.
