OBJECTIVE: Surfactant Proteins (SPs) are well known from lung and form, along 
with phospholipids, a surface-active-layer at the liquid-air-interface of the 
alveolar lining. They play a major protective role by lowering surface tension, 
activating innate and adaptive immune defense at the lung mucosal interface, 
especially during infection. We analyzed the regulation of SPs in human and 
mouse articular chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and synovial fluid under healthy and 
inflammatory conditions, as well as in tissues of patients suffering from 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blotting were 
performed in cell cultures and tissue samples to determine localization, 
regulation, and concentration of SPs.
RESULTS: All four SPs, were expressed by healthy human and mouse articular 
chondrocytes and synoviocytes and were also present in synovial fluid. Treatment 
with inflammatory mediators like IL-1β and TNF-α led to short-term upregulation 
of individual SPs in vitro. In tissues from patients with osteoarthritis and 
rheumatoid arthritis, protein levels of all four SPs increased significantly 
compared to the controls used.
CONCLUSION: These results show the distribution and amount of SPs in tissues of 
articular joints. They are produced by chondrocytes and synoviocytes and occur 
in measurable amounts in synovial fluid. All four SPs seem to be differently 
regulated under pathologic conditions. Their physiological functions in lowering 
surface tension and immune defense need further elucidation and make them 
potential candidates for therapeutic intervention.
