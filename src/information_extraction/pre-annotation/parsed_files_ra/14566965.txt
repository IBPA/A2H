Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibits matrix synthesis by chondrocytes 
in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis; however, the underlying signaling 
pathways are poorly characterized. This study investigated the 
TNFalpha-activated pathways regulating expression of two key components of the 
cartilage matrix-link protein and type II collagen. In rat articular 
chondrocytes, TNFalpha decreased link protein and type II collagen mRNA to 
undetectable levels within 48 h. Levels of link protein mRNA recovered more 
readily than type II collagen mRNA following removal of the cytokine. 
TNFalpha-mediated reduction in mRNA of both matrix molecules occurred at the 
level of transcription and, for link protein, mRNA stability. Turnover of type 
II collagen and link protein mRNA was dependent on new protein synthesis. In 
both prechondrocytes and articular chondrocytes, TNFalpha induced 
concentration-dependent activation of MEK1/2 and NF-kappaB, but not p38 or JNK. 
Sustained activation of NF-kappaB was observed for up to 72 h following 
continuous or transient exposure to TNFalpha. Using pharmacological and 
molecular approaches, the MEK1/2 and NF-kappaB pathways were found to mediate 
inhibition of type II collagen and link protein gene expression by TNFalpha. 
Both prechondrocytes and articular chondrocytes are targets of TNFalpha. This 
study identifies pathways through which TNFalpha perturbs the synthesis and 
organization of articular cartilage matrix during inflammation.
