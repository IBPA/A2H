Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic autoimmune-disease with 
complex and unclear etiology. Hypotonicity of synovial fluid is a typical 
characteristic of RA, which may play pivotal roles in RA pathogenesis. In this 
work, we studied the responses of RA synovial fibroblasts to hypotonic stress 
in vitro and further explored the underlying mechanisms. Data showed that 
hyposmotic solutions significantly triggered increases in cytosolic calcium 
concentration ([Ca2+]c) of synoviocytes. Subsequently, it caused rapid release 
of ATP, as well as remarkable production of intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Meanwhile, hypotonic stimulus promoted the proliferation of 
synovial fibroblasts. These effects were almost abolished by calcium-free buffer 
and significantly inhibited by gadolinium (III) chloride (a mechanosensitive 
Ca2+ channel blocker) and ruthenium red (a transient receptor potential 
vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) blocker). 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, a specific agonist 
of TRPV4, also mimicked hypotonic shock-induced responses shown above. In 
contrast, voltage-gated channel inhibitors verapamil and nifedipine had little 
influences on these responses. Furthermore, RT-PCR and western blotting 
evidently detected TRPV4 expression at mRNA and protein level in isolated 
synoviocytes. Taken together, our results indicated that hypotonic stimulus 
resulted in ATP release, ROS production, and cell proliferation depending on 
Ca2+ entry through activation of TRPV4 channel in synoviocytes.
