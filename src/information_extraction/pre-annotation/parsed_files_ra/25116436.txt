The antimalarial drug artemisinin and its derivatives exhibit potent 
immunosuppressive activity in several autoimmune disease models, however the 
mechanisms are not well-understood. This study was designed to investigate the 
therapeutic effects and the underlying mechanisms of the artemisinin analog 
artesunate using the K/BxN mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. The well-studied 
disease mechanisms of K/BxN model allowed us to pinpoint the effect of 
artesunate on disease. Artesunate treatment prevented arthritis development in 
young K/BxN mice by inhibiting germinal center (GC) formation and production of 
autoantibodies. In adult K/BxN mice with established arthritis, artesunate 
diminished GC B cells in a few days. However, artesunate did not affect the 
follicular helper T cells (Tfh). In contrast to the spontaneous K/BxN model, 
artesunate treatment exerted minor influence on K/BxN serum transfer induced 
arthritis suggesting that artesunate has minimal effect on inflammatory 
responses downstream of antibody production. Finally, we showed that artesunate 
preferentially inhibits proliferating GC B cells. These results identify GC B 
cells as a target of artesunate and provide a new rationale for using 
artemisinin analogues to treat autoimmune diseases mediated by autoantibodies.
