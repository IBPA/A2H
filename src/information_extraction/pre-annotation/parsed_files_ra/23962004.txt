Current data support a role for gut colonization in maintaining balanced mucosal 
and systemic immune responses and have suggested aberrant innate immune 
recognition of enteric bacteria as an initiator of the adaptive immune damage 
associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
colitis). In fact, data from human studies and experimental mouse models have 
implicated transformation of the gut microbiota from a beneficial symbiotic 
state to one of imbalance or "dysbiosis" in the pathogenesis of several 
autoinflammatory diseases, including allergic skin and respiratory disorders, 
rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and colorectal cancer. The host has 
evolved to co-exist and maintain a mutualistic relationship with the commensal 
microbes of the gut, and it is the function of the host innate immune system to 
initiate and maintain this homeostasis, while retaining the ability to respond 
appropriately to pathogenic organisms. In this review, we discuss the molecular 
and cellular interactions of the mucosal immune system that decide this delicate 
balance of mutualism. Furthermore, we will highlight the role of dendritic cells 
in preserving this precarious balance and how gene products of commensal 
microbes may play an integral role in re-establishing this balance once it has 
gone awry.
