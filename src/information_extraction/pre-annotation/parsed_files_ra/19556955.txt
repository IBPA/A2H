Animal-assisted therapy is a familiar method of treatment in the rehabilitation 
of many illnesses and conditions, but is still not applied sufficiently in our 
milieu. This paper gives an overview of the available literature and some of the 
research which demonstrates that the interaction between the patient, animal and 
therapist provides a context which improves communication, elevates 
self-confidence, reduces the symptoms of diseases, and improves the quality of 
life. The dog, cat, horse, birds and toy animals are most often used in therapy. 
Short-term contacts with animals are used, as well as long term keeping of 
animals, which are looked after by patients following a particular methodology. 
The therapy is used in the treatment of psychiatric patients afflicted with 
depression, schizophrenia, phobias and addiction problems. Loneliness is easier 
to endure in the company of animals. It is also applied in cardiovascular 
diseases, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, child cerebral paralysis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, AIDS, and other diseases. Research shows a more rapid reduction of 
symptoms of many diseases when animals are included in the therapeutic process.
