In humans, large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (LGLL) is a low-grade, indolent 
lymphoproliferative disorder of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) associated with 
autoimmune disorders; including rheumatoid arthritis and single or multiple 
cytopenias; particularly neutropenia. Therapy largely centres around 
immunosuppression which aims to resolve the immune-mediated secondary pathology, 
often without eradicating the neoplastic clone. The most effective agents appear 
to be cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and methotrexate. This case report 
describes the presentation, diagnostics, therapeutic approach and outcome of a 6 
year-old Golden Retriever presenting with severe neutropenia. Chlorambucil, 
prednisolone and cyclosporine failed to improve the neutropenia but subsequent 
cyclophosphamide resulted in a sustained albeit temporary improvement in 
neutrophil count and the ability to withdraw prophylactic antibacterials. This 
case closely mirrors the diagnostics and therapeutic response in human LGLL.
