Recent work has supported a key role for spinal cytokines and glial activation 
in the development and maintenance of persistent neuropathic pain after 
peripheral nerve injury. This study was undertaken to determine whether the 
active metabolite of leflunomide (A77 1726), an anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive agent, could attenuate persistent mechanical allodynia in a 
rodent L5 spinal nerve transection model. A77 1726 was administered daily 
intraperitoneally (0.01 to 10 mg/kg) beginning 1 day before nerve transection. 
In a separate experiment, A77 1726 was administered daily intrathecally (0.001 
to 10 microg in 40 microL) beginning 1 hour before nerve transection. Both 
systemic and centrally administered A77 1726 significantly reduced mechanical 
allodynia across the time course of the study (P < .05). A77 1726 attenuated 
glial activation on day 10 after transection at doses that reduced mechanical 
sensitivity. In addition, central A77 1726 administration decreased spinal 
expression of major histocompatibility complex class II. Spinal interleukin-6 
levels were unaffected by A77 1726 treatment. This study provides further 
evidence implicating a contribution of spinal glial activation in the 
development and maintenance of persistent neuropathic pain. Furthermore, this 
study reports that systemic and central administration of the active metabolite 
of leflunomide, an immunosuppressive agent used for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, produces an antiallodynic action in a rodent mononeuropathy model.
