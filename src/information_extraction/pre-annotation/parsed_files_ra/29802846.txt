Parasitic worms are receiving much attention as a potential new therapeutic 
approach to treating autoimmune and allergic conditions but concerns remain 
regarding their safety. As an alternative strategy, we have focused on the use 
of defined parasitic worm products and recently taken this one step further by 
designing drug-like small molecule analogues of one such product, ES-62, which 
is anti-inflammatory by virtue of covalently attached phosphorylcholine 
moieties. Previously, we have shown that ES-62 mimics are efficacious in 
protecting against disease in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic 
lupus erythematosus and skin and lung allergy. Given the potential role of 
chronic inflammation in fibrosis, in the present study we have focused our 
attention on lung fibrosis, a debilitating condition for which there is no cure 
and which in spite of treatment slowly gets worse over time. Two mouse models of 
fibrosis - bleomycin-induced and LPS-induced - in which roles for inflammation 
have been implicated were adopted. Four ES-62 analogues were tested - 11a and 
12b, previously shown to be active in mouse models of allergic and autoimmune 
disease and 16b and AIK-29/62 both of which are structurally related to 11a. All 
four compounds were found to significantly reduce disease development in both 
fibrosis models, as shown by histopathological analysis of lung tissue, 
indicating their potential as treatments for this condition.
