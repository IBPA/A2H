The clinical applications of etanercept (Enbrel), an emerging therapeutic 
protein for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are limited by its instability and low 
bioavailability. In this study, a long-term and efficient therapeutic 
nanocomplex formulation for RA treatment was developed in the form of a 
temperature-modulated noncovalent interaction controllable (TMN) complex based 
on a temperature-sensitive amphiphilic polyelectrolyte (succinylated 
pullulan-g-oligo(L-lactide); SPL). The TMN complexes were prepared by simply 
mixing the negatively charged SPL copolymer and the positively charged 
etanercept via electrostatic interaction at 4 °C below the polymer's clouding 
temperature (CT), and the resulting complex demonstrated significantly improved 
salt and serum stability with increased hydrophobic interactions at temperatures 
(physiological condition, 37.5 °C) above the CT. An in vitro study of the 
bioactivity of etanercept indicated that the TMN complex improves the long-term 
stability of etanercept in an aqueous environment because of the exposure of the 
functional active site and the molecular chaperone-like effect of the 
hydrophobic copolymer. This formulation possessed prolonged in vivo 
pharmacokinetic parameters. In a collagen-induced arthritis RA rat model, we 
verified the outstanding therapeutic effect of the TMN complexes. These results 
imply that this approach would be widely applied to protein and peptide delivery 
systems.
