A series of furano[3,2-d]pyrimidine Syk inhibitors were synthesized and 
optimized for their enzyme potency and selectivity versus other kinases. In 
addition, ADME properties were assessed and compounds were prepared with 
optimized profiles for in vivo experiments. Compound 23 was identified as having 
acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrated efficacy in a rat 
collagen induced arthritis model.
