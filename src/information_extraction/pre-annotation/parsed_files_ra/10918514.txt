The preclinical safety assessment of biopharmaceuticals necessitates that 
studies be conducted in species in which the products are pharmacologically 
active. Monoclonal antibodies are a promising class of biopharmaceuticals for 
many disease indications; however, by design, these agents tend to have limited 
species cross-reactivity and tend to only be active in primates. Keliximab is a 
human-cynomolgus monkey chimeric (Primatized) monoclonal antibody with 
specificity for human and chimpanzee CD4. In order to conduct a comprehensive 
preclinical safety assessment of this antibody to support chronic treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis in patients, a human CD4 transgenic mouse was used for 
chronic and reproductive toxicity studies and for genotoxic studies. In 
addition, immunotoxicity studies were conducted in these mice with Candida 
albicans, Pneumocystis carinii and B16 melanoma cells to assess the effects of 
keliximab on host resistance to infection and immunosurveillance to neoplasia. 
The results of these studies found keliximab to be well tolerated with the only 
effects observed being related to its pharmacologic activity on CD4+ T 
lymphocytes. The use of transgenic mice expressing human proteins provides a 
useful alternative to studies in chimpanzees with biopharmaceutical agents 
having limited species cross-reactivity.
