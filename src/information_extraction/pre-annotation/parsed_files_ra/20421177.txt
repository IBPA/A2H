We investigated the effects and mechanisms by which FTY720 (FTY) inhibits 
arthritis development in the SKG mouse rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model. FTY 
(1mg/kg/day) administration suppressed the progression of laminarin-induced 
arthritis in SKG mice. FTY treatment decreased IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression in 
synovial fibroblast cells and the number of inflammatory cells overall. Bone 
destruction was also suppressed by treatment with FTY. The numbers of CD4(+) and 
CD8(+) T cells were significantly increased in the thymus and decreased in the 
spleen in FTY-treated SKG mice. FTY enhanced IL-4 production by CD4(+) T cells 
stimulated by allogeneic spleen cells and inhibited prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) 
production by a TNF-alpha-stimulated synovial fibroblast cell line. These 
results indicate that FTY can inhibit arthritis in SKG mice via sequestration of 
autoimmune CD4(+) T cells in the thymus, enhancement of Th2 immune responses, 
and inhibition of PGE(2) production by synovial cells.
