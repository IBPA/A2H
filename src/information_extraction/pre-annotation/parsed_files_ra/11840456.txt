OBJECTIVE: Reactive oxygen species are thought to play a role in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in humans. We postulated that antioxidant treatment could have a 
beneficial effect in this disease. We therefore investigated the effects of 
vitamin E in the transgenic KRN/NOD mouse model of RA.
METHODS: Mice were treated by gavage with oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). 
Clinical, histologic, and biochemical parameters were assessed for 6 weeks.
RESULTS: Vitamin E treatment did not modify the clinical features of the disease 
(date of onset or disease intensity, as measured by the articular index), but it 
did prevent joint destruction, as measured by qualitative and semiquantitative 
analyses. Redox status did not differ between treated and control mice. White 
blood cell chemiluminescence was higher in transgenic KRN/NOD mice than in 
controls, but vitamin E treatment attenuated this difference. Vitamin E 
treatment of the transgenic animals led to a significant decrease in the levels 
of interleukin-(IL-1beta) but not tumor necrosis factor alpha.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin E seems to uncouple joint inflammation and joint destruction 
in this model of RA, with a beneficial effect on joint destruction. Since many 
investigations are currently in progress to evaluate the benefit of 
interventions targeted toward anti-IL-1beta, our findings suggest opportunities 
of therapeutic interest in human RA.
