Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is etiologically associated with a variety of diseases 
including lymphoproliferative diseases, lymphomas, carcinomas, and autoimmune 
diseases. Humans are the only natural host of EBV and limited species of 
new-world monkeys can be infected with the virus in experimental conditions. 
Small animal models of EBV infection, required for evaluation of novel therapies 
and vaccines for EBV-associated diseases, have not been available. Recently the 
development of severely immunodeficient mouse strains enabled production of 
humanized mice in which human immune system components are reconstituted and 
express their normal functions. Humanized mice can serve as infection models for 
human-specific viruses such as EBV that target cells of the immune system. This 
review summarizes recent studies by the author's group addressing reproduction 
of EBV infection and pathogenesis in humanized mice.
