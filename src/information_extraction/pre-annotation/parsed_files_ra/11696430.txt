There is considerable evidence that osteoclasts are involved in the pathogenesis 
of focal bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis. Tumor necrosis factor-related 
activation-induced cytokine, also known as receptor activator of nuclear 
factor-kappaB ligand (TRANCE/RANKL) is an essential factor for osteoclast 
differentiation. In addition to its role in osteoclast differentiation and 
activation, TRANCE/RANKL also functions to augment T-cell dendritic cell 
cooperative interactions. To further evaluate the role of osteoclasts in focal 
bone erosion in arthritis, we generated inflammatory arthritis in the 
TRANCE/RANKL knockout mouse using a serum transfer model that bypasses the 
requirement for T-cell activation. These animals exhibit an osteopetrotic 
phenotype characterized by the absence of osteoclasts. Inflammation, measured by 
clinical signs of arthritis and histopathological scoring, was comparable in 
wild-type and TRANCE/RANKL knockout mice. Microcomputed tomography and 
histopathological analysis demonstrated that the degree of bone erosion in 
TRANCE/RANKL knockout mice was dramatically reduced compared to that seen in 
control littermate mice. In contrast, cartilage erosion was present in both 
control littermate and TRANCE/RANKL knockout mice. These results confirm the 
central role of osteoclasts in the pathogenesis of bone erosion in arthritis and 
demonstrate distinct mechanisms of cartilage destruction and bone erosion in 
this animal model of arthritis.
