Macrophages are very important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The increase in the number of sublining macrophages in the synovium is an early 
hallmark of active rheumatic disease, and high numbers of macrophages are a 
prominent feature of inflammatory lesions. The degree of synovial macrophage 
infiltration correlates with the degree of joint erosion, and depletion of these 
macrophages from inflamed tissue has a profound therapeutic benefit. Research 
has now uncovered an unexpectedly high level of heterogeneity in macrophage 
origin and function, and has emphasized the role of environmental factors in 
their functional specialization. Although the heterogeneous populations of 
macrophages in RA have not been fully characterized, preliminary results in 
mouse models of arthritis have contributed to our understanding of the phenotype 
and ontogeny of synovial macrophages, and to deciphering the properties of 
monocyte-derived infiltrating and tissue-resident macrophages. Elucidating the 
molecular mechanisms that drive polarization of macrophages towards 
proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes could lead to identification of 
signalling pathways that inform future therapeutic strategies.
