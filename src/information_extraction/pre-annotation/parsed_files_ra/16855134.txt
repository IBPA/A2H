The release of endogenous glucocorticoids is critical in regulating the severity 
of disease activity in patients with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Blocking cortisol production results in a flare-up in disease 
activity in RA patients, and surgical removal of the adrenals in patients with 
Cushing's disease has been reported to exacerbate autoimmune disease. In 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA; a rat model of RA), there is an activation of 
the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis associated with the development of 
inflammation. In addition, there are profound changes in peptides within the 
paraventricular nucleus, which are responsible for regulating the HPA axis. 
These changes have profound implications on the ability of AA rats to respond to 
acute stress. Understanding the regulation of the HPA axis in health and disease 
holds out the promise of targeted therapy to alleviate inflammatory conditions. 
This article will consider the impact of stress on an individual and his or her 
susceptibility to inflammation. We wish to question the idea that stress is "all 
bad." As we shall see, exposure to a single acute stressor can alter the 
phenotype of the rat to change it from being susceptible to resistant in 
autoimmune disease models. This alteration in susceptibility takes days to 
manifest itself, but can last for weeks, suggesting beneficial effects of 
exposure to an acute stressor.
