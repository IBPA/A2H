The citrus flavonoid hesperidin has been reported to possess a wide range of 
pharmacological properties. We have investigated the preventive and therapeutic 
effects of hesperidin on the development of adjuvant arthritis (AA), a rat model 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Freund's complete adjuvant was used to induce AA 
in rats. Secondary paw swelling, polyarthritis index and histopathological 
assessment of ankle joints were used to evaluate the effects of hesperidin on AA 
rats. Concanavalin-A-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin (IL)-2 
production by splenocytes were measured using the MTT assay. Levels of IL-1, 
IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secreted by peritoneal macrophages 
(PM) were measured by RIA. Intragastric administration of hesperidin 
significantly attenuated secondary paw swelling and reduced the polyarthritis 
index of AA rats in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, hesperidin clearly 
ameliorated the pathological changes in AA rats. Hesperidin also restored the 
suppression of T-lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production, and downregulated 
production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by PM in AA rats. Our results suggest 
that hesperidin improves AA by downregulating the function of over-active 
macrophages and by up-regulating the activities of dysfunctional T lymphocytes. 
Hesperidin may therefore have therapeutic value for the clinical treatment of 
RA. Further research is required to clarify the detailed mechanisms of the 
protective effects of hesperidin on AA.
