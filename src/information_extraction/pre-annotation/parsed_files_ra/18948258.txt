In the K/BxN mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, autoantibodies specific for 
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) can transfer joint-specific inflammation to 
most strains of normal mice. Binding of GPI and autoantibody to the joint 
surface is a prerequisite for joint-specific inflammation. However, how GPI 
localizes to the joint remains unclear. We show that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 
are the high affinity (83 nm) joint receptors for GPI. The binding affinity and 
structural differences between mouse paw/ankle GAGs and elbows/knee GAGs 
correlated with the distal to proximal disease severity in these joints. We 
found that cartilage surface GPI binding was greatly reduced by either 
chondroitinase ABC or beta-glucuronidase treatment. We also identified several 
inhibitors that inhibit both GPI/GAG interaction and GPI enzymatic activities, 
which suggests that the GPI GAG-binding domain overlaps with the active site of 
GPI enzyme. Our studies raise the possibility that GAGs are the receptors for 
other autoantigens involved in joint-specific inflammatory responses.
