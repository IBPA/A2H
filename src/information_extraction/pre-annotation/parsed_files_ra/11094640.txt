A lipid-rich extract, prepared by supercritical fluid (CO2) extraction of 
freeze-dried stabilized NZ green-lipped mussel powder (Lyprinol) has shown 
significant anti-inflammatory (AI) activity when given to animals and humans. 
When treated p.o. with Lyprinol, Wistar and Dark Agouti rats developed neither 
adjuvant-induced polyarthritis or collagen(II)-induced auto-allergic arthritis. 
This was achieved with doses < NSAIDs, and 200 times < of other seed or fish 
oils. Lyprinol subfractions inhibited LTB4 biosynthesis by PMN in vitro, and 
PGE2 production by activated macrophages. Much of this AI activity was 
associated with omega-3 PUFAs and natural antioxidants [e.g. carotenoids]. In 
contrast to NSAIDs, Lyprinol is non-gastro toxic in disease-stressed rats at 300 
mg/kg p.o., and does not affect platelet aggregation [human, rat]. Clinical 
studies, either controlled or randomized, have demonstrated very significant AI 
activity in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
asthma, and other inflammatory conditions. Lyprinol is a reproducible, stable 
source of bioactive lipids with much greater potency than plant/marine oils 
currently used as nutritional supplements to ameliorate signs of inflammation.
