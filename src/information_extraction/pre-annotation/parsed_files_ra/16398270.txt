Rat adjuvant arthritis (AA), a model of chronic inflammation and an experimental 
model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been used to evaluate the possible 
anti-inflammatory action of seventeen N,O-acil-threo-DL-phenylserines 1-17. For 
this purpose experiments on 200 male Wistar rats were performed. The obtained 
results showed that oral administration of all compounds, except 15, inhibited 
the development of AA as compared with the control group. Although the level of 
arthritic suppression of some preparations was equivalent to aspirin or exceeded 
it (compounds 2-4, 6, 10, 13), only the preparation 10 in a dose of 100 mg/kg 
significantly change the paw swelling (P < 0.02) which decreased by 27.9-31.7% 
at the end of experiment. Pronounced inhibition (P < 0.05-0.01) of joint 
swelling and the indices of pathological process activity were revealed in 
earlier stages of AA under the treatment with compounds such as 6 and 11. The 
antiinflammatory effect of some compounds (9, 11, 13) was observed in the middle 
of the experiment, although only compound 9 showed significant suppression by 
35.9-37.9% at this stage (P < 0.01-0.001) which also markedly decreased ESR (P < 
0.05). The latter index was significantly reduced by the action of preparations 
2-4, 6-8. Most of the compounds investigated improved blood indices and 
prevented the development of polyarthritis.
