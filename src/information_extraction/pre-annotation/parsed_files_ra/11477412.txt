In K/BxN T cell receptor-transgenic mice, spontaneous inflammatory arthritis 
exhibiting many of the features of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is initiated 
by T cells, but is almost entirely sustained by antibodies to the self-antigen 
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). The relevance of these observations to 
human disease has been questioned. Here we show that 64% of humans with RA, but 
not controls, had increased concentrations of anti-GPI immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 
serum and synovial fluid. In addition, the concentrations of soluble GPI in the 
sera and synovial fluids of RA patients were also elevated, which led to immune 
complex formation. Using phage-display methods, we cloned a panel of specific 
high-affinity human monoclonal anti-GPI IgGs from a patient with RA. These 
antibodies were highly somatically mutated, which was indicative of an 
affinity-matured response that was antigen driven. Immunohistochemistry of RA 
synovium showed high concentrations of GPI on the surface of the synovial lining 
and on the endothelial cell surface of arterioles; this indicated a mechanism by 
which antibodies to GPI may precipitate joint disease. The results indicate that 
the immunological events that lead to the development of autoimmune disease in 
the K/BxN mouse model may also occur in human RA. This data may be used to 
develop new strategies for therapeutic intervention.
