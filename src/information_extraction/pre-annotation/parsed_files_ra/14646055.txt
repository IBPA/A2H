A new therapeutic system called the "total joint regeneration system" is 
proposed as a treatment for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We have 
developed devices which allow the regeneration of damaged cartilage under 
noninvasive mechanical stimulation. This paper introduces the basic concepts of 
total joint regeneration and reports the results of the first animal experiment 
using an internal-fixator device using rabbits and a dog.
