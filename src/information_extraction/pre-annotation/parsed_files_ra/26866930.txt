Altered vascular reactivity due to endothelial dysfunction, consequent to 
vascular damage, is observed in rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated the effect 
of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) on vasculature changes in arthritis induced by 
complete Freund's adjuvant in male Wistar rats. Arthritis decreased soluble 
receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) whereas elevated aortic 
RAGE expression, increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), systolic blood pressure and the contractility induced by phenylephrine 
and KCl. Moreover, arthritis decreased the relaxing effect of acetylcholine. 
Neither arthritis nor Ang-(1-7) altered sodium nitroprusside relaxation. 
Ang-(1-7) reversed the effect of arthritis on TNF-α, sRAGE and RAGE expression 
without any effect on the IL-1β. Ang-(1-7) decreased phenylephrine and KCl 
contractility, especially in the endothelial-denuded aorta, whereas increased 
acetylcholine relaxation in the endothelial-intact aorta. Ang-(1-7) could find 
its place in the treatment protocol of arthritis and vascular diseases.
