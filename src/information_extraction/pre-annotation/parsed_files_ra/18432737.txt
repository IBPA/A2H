Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an experimental autoimmune disease that can 
be elicited in susceptible strains of rodents (rat and mouse) and nonhuman 
primates by immunization with type II collagen (CII), the major constituent 
protein of articular cartilage. Because of the important similarities between 
CIA and rheumatoid arthritis, this experimental model of autoimmune arthritis 
has been the subject of extensive investigation in several laboratories. 
Protocols for CIA are described in this unit for both the mouse model and the 
rat model. In addition, protocols are included for the purification of CII from 
bovine articular joints and chicken sternums, for the purification of collagen 
a1(II) chains, and for the purification of fragments of these chains following 
cyanogen bromide (CNBr) digestion. The preparation of CII is a time-consuming 
procedure but is usually required because of the scarcity and expense of 
commercial sources of purified native CII. In addition, support protocols are 
provided for assessing the severity of inflammation following CIA and for 
measuring B and T cell responses to CII.
