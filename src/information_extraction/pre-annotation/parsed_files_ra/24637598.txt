A key role for segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) has recently been 
demonstrated in several mouse models of autoimmune diseases, including 
autoimmune arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism governing the 
activation of systemic autoreactive T cell responses by such commensals in the 
gut, however, remained elusive. In this addendum, we discuss recent results 
addressing the local regulation of autoreactive T cell sensitivity by these 
unique bacteria. We found that the presence of SFB in the gut microbiota was 
sufficient to promote a local inflammatory microenvironment altering the T 
cell-intrinsic desensitization process normally occurring in response to chronic 
self-antigen stimulation. In the absence of this key tolerance checkpoint, 
sustained chronic T cell proliferation, IFNÎ³ production, and B cell activation 
eventually led to the development of enhanced pathologies in a Th1-driven T 
cell-transfer model of autoimmune arthritis.
