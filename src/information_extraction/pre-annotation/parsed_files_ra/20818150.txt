Th17 cells, though having been discovered just few years ago, is believed as the 
pathogenic T cells in many autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory 
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Biologics targeting IL-17 have 
already been on clinical trial, and the results were recently reported. Although 
the importance of Th17 cells in animal models of arthritis is unquestionable, it 
is not recognized that there are only limited data on the role of Th17 cells and 
related cytokines in human arthritic diseases. In addition, the characteristics 
of human Th17 cells have not been fully defined, and there seem to be 
substantial differences between human and mouse Th17 cells. In this review, I 
will introduce and discuss about updated findings on human Th17 cells and its 
relation with human arthritic diseases.
