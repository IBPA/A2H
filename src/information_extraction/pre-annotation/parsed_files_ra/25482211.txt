Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting in joint 
inflammation, pain, and eventual bone loss. Bone loss and remodeling caused by 
symmetric polyarthritis, the hallmark of RA, is readily detectable by bone 
mineral density (BMD) measurement using micro-CT. Abnormalities in these 
measurements over time reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the bone. To 
evaluate the efficacy of anti-rheumatic agents in animal models of arthritis, we 
developed a high throughput knee and ankle joint imaging assay to measure BMD as 
a translational biomarker. A bone sample holder was custom designed for micro-CT 
scanning, which significantly increased assay throughput. Batch processing 
3-dimensional image reconstruction, followed by automated image cropping, 
significantly reduced image processing time. In addition, we developed a novel, 
automated image analysis method to measure BMD and bone volume of knee and ankle 
joints. These improvements significantly increased the throughput of ex vivo 
bone sample analysis, reducing data turnaround from 5 days to 24 hours for a 
study with 200 rat hind limbs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that BMD, as 
quantified by micro-CT, is a robust efficacy biomarker with a high degree of 
sensitivity. Our innovative approach toward evaluation of BMD using optimized 
image acquisition and novel image processing techniques in preclinical models of 
RA enables high throughput assessment of anti-rheumatic agents offering a 
powerful tool for drug discovery.
