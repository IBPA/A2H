Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by erosive inflammation of the joints, new 
bone proliferation, and ankylosis, leading to severely reduced locomotion and 
intense chronic pain. In a model of this disease, adjuvant-induced polyarthritis 
in the rat, neurons involved in pain transmission and control undergo plastic 
changes, especially at the spinal level. These changes affect notably neurons 
that contain opioids, such as enkephalins deriving from preproenkephalin A (PA) 
precursor protein. Using recombinant herpes simplex virus containing rat PA 
cDNA, we enhanced enkephalin synthesis in sensory neurons of polyarthritic rats. 
This treatment markedly improved locomotion and reduced hyperalgesia. 
Furthermore, the progression of bone destruction slowed down, which is the most 
difficult target to reach in the treatment of patients suffering from arthritis. 
These data demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of enkephalin overproduction in 
a model of systemic inflammatory and painful chronic disorder.
