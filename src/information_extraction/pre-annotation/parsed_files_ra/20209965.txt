OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of action on compatible using of total 
alkaloids of Radix Aconiti Praeparata and total glycosides or polysaccharides of 
Radix Paeoniae Alba therapy on rheumatoid arthritis in rats.
METHOD: The rat models of rheumatoid arthritis of cold and dampness syndrome 
were treated with total alkaloids of Radix Aconiti Praeparata and total 
glycosides or polysaccharides of Radix Paeoniae Alba. Observed the contents of 
hypothalamic L-ENK, hypothalamic-END, plasmatic SP, serumal IgG, serumal cell 
factors (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-2, IL-10) by radioimmunity method and 
ultrastructural change of synovial cell in electron microscope.
RESULT: Total alkaloids of Radix Aconiti Praeparata and total glycosides or 
polysaccharides of Radix Paeoniae Alba could relieve arthrocele and arthralgia 
and elevate the contents of L-ENK, beta-END, IL-2 and degrade the contents of 
SP, IgG, IL-1beta, IL-6 and inhibit abnormal secretion accentuation of synovial 
cell like fiber.
CONCLUSION: Total alkaloids of Radix Aconiti Praeparata and total glycosides or 
polysaccharides of Radix Paeoniae Alba could be used to treat rheumatoid 
arthritis of cold and dampness syndrome. The mechanism of action might be that 
the contents of center endogenous opioid peptides had increased, the synthesis 
and release of SP had been inhibited, the disturbance of serumal cell factor had 
been adjusted, and the synthesis and secretion of serum immune globulin and 
abnormal secretion accentuation of synovial cell had been inhibited.
