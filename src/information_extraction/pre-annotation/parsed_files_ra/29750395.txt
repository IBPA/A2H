OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that ADAMTS-12 is a susceptibility gene for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development, and its level is significantly increased 
in RA patients. In addition, ADAMTS-12 is reported to be required for 
inflammation in otherwise healthy subjects. This study was undertaken to 
determine the role of ADAMTS-12 and the underlying mechanisms in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established in 
ADAMTS-12-deficient mice and their control littermates to determine the role of 
ADAMTS-12 in vivo. Micro-computed tomography scanning was used to demonstrate 
the destruction of the ankle joint; histologic analysis illustrated synovitis, 
pannus formation, and bone and cartilage destruction; enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay was performed to measure serum levels of inflammatory 
cytokines; and protein-protein interaction assays were performed to detect the 
interactions of ADAMTS-12 and its various deletion mutants with connective 
tissue growth factor (CTGF).
RESULTS: Deficiency of ADAMTS-12 led to accelerated inflammatory arthritis in 
the CIA mouse model. Loss of ADAMTS-12 caused enhanced osteoclastogenesis. In 
vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that ADAMTS-12 
bound and processed CTGF, a previously unrecognized substrate of ADAMTS-12. In 
addition, deletion of ADAMTS-12 enhanced, while overexpression of ADMATS-12 
reduced, CTGF-mediated inflammation. Furthermore, ADAMTS-12 regulation of 
inflammation was largely lost in CTGF-deficient macrophages. Importantly, 
blocking of CTGF attenuated elevated inflammatory arthritis seen in the 
ADAMTS-12-deficient CIA mouse model.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that ADAMTS-12 is a critical regulator 
of inflammatory arthritis and that this is mediated, at least in part, through 
control of CTGF turnover.
