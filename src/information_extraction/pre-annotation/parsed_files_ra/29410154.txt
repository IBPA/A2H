ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pterocephalus hookeri (C.B. Clarke) HÃ¶eck, one 
of the most popular Tibetan herbs, has been widely applied in Tibetan medicine 
prescriptions. Chemical investigations have led to the isolation of many 
bis-iridoids. However, the pharmacological activities of bis-iridoid 
constituents of this plant have never been reported before.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and analgesic 
activities of afraction of bis-iridoid constituents of P. hookeri (BCPH) in 
order to provide experimental evidence for its traditional use, such as for 
cold, flu, and rheumatoid arthritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analgesic effects of BCPH were investigated using the 
hot-plate test and acetic acid-induced writhing test. The anti-inflammatory 
activities were observed using the following models: carrageenin-induced edema 
of the hind paw of rats and xylene-induced ear edema in mice. The effects of 
dexamethasone administration were also studied.
RESULTS: BCPH significantly increased the hot-platepain threshold and reduced 
acetic acid-induced writhing response in mice. Moreover, BCPH remarkably 
inhibited xylene-induced ear edema and reduced the carrageenin-induced rat paw 
edema perimeter.
CONCLUSION: The results reveal that BCPH has central, peripheral analgesic 
activities as well as anti-inflammatory effects, supporting the traditional 
application of this herb in treating various diseases associated with 
inflammation and pain.
