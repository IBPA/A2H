Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that produces 
synovial proliferation and joint erosions. The pathologic lesions of RA are 
driven through the production of inflammatory mediators in the synovium 
mediated, in part, by the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We have identified a 
non-steroidal estrogen receptor ligand, WAY-169916, that selectively inhibits 
NF-kappaB transcriptional activity but is devoid of conventional estrogenic 
activity. The activity of WAY-169916 was monitored in two models of arthritis, 
the HLA-B27 transgenic rat and the Lewis rat adjuvant-induced model, after daily 
oral administration. In both models, a near complete reversal in hindpaw scores 
was observed as well as marked improvements in the histological scores. In the 
Lewis rat adjuvant model, WAY-169916 markedly suppresses the adjuvant induction 
of three serum acute phase proteins: haptoglobin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein 
(alpha1-AGP), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Gene expression experiments also 
demonstrate a global suppression of adjuvant-induced gene expression in the 
spleen, liver, and popliteal lymph nodes. Finally, WAY-169916 was effective in 
suppressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated inflammatory gene expression in 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes isolated from patients with RA. Together, these 
data suggest the utility of WAY-169916, and other compounds in its class, in 
treating RA through global suppression of inflammation via selective blockade of 
NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.
