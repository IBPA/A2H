CD23(+)CD21(high)CD1d(high) B cells in inflamed nodes (Bin cells) accumulate in 
the lymph nodes (LNs) draining inflamed joints of the TNF-α-transgenic mouse 
model of rheumatoid arthritis and are primarily involved in the significant 
histological and functional LN alterations that accompany disease exacerbation 
in this strain. In this study, we investigate the origin and function of Bin 
cells. We show that adoptively transferred GFP(+) sorted mature follicular B 
(FoB) cells home preferentially to inflamed LNs of TNF-α-transgenic mice where 
they rapidly differentiate into Bin cells, with a close correlation with the 
endogenous Bin fraction. Bin cells are also induced in wild-type LNs after 
immunization with T-dependent Ags and display a germinal center phenotype at 
higher rates compared with FoB cells. Furthermore, we show that Bin cells can 
capture and process Ag-immune complexes in a CD21-dependent manner more 
efficiently than can FoB cells, and they express greater levels of MHC class II 
and costimulatory Ags CD80 and CD86. We propose that Bin cells are a previously 
unrecognized inflammation-induced B cell population with increased Ag capture 
and activation potential, which may facilitate normal immune responses but may 
contribute to autoimmunity when chronic inflammation causes their accumulation 
and persistence in affected LNs.
