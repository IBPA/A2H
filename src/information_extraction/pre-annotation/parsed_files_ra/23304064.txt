Inflammation is a complex biological response of tissues to harmful stimuli such 
as pathogens, cell damage, or irritants. Inflammation is considered to be a 
major cause of most chronic diseases, especially in more than 100 types of 
inflammatory diseases which include Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
asthma, atherosclerosis, Crohn's disease, colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and 
Parkinson's disease. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on 
inflammatory diseases. TBK1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase which regulates 
antiviral defense, host-virus interaction, and immunity. It is ubiquitously 
expressed in mouse stomach, colon, thymus, and liver. Interestingly, high levels 
of active TBK1 have also been found to be associated with inflammatory diseases, 
indicating that TBK1 is closely related to inflammatory responses. Even though 
relatively few studies have addressed the functional roles of TBK1 relating to 
inflammation, this paper discusses some recent findings that support the 
critical role of TBK1 in inflammatory diseases and underlie the necessity of 
trials to develop useful remedies or therapeutics that target TBK1 for the 
treatment of inflammatory diseases.
