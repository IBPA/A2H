The growth and metastasis of human solid tumors and the development of 
conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory 
psoriasis, and others are regulated by the balance between angiogenic 
stimulators and inhibitors released in the angiogenic-pathological 
microenvironment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic 
factor, is a potent endothelial-specific mitogen that activates endothelial 
cells in pathological angiogenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that caffeic acid 
phenethyl ester (CAPE) inhibits tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. However, 
the precise molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of CAPE on 
VEGF-mediated angiogenesis remains unknown. Here, we show that CAPE suppressed 
VEGF-induced proliferation, tube formation, migration, the formation of actin 
stress fibers and loss of VE-cadherin at cell-cell contacts in endothelial 
cells, indicating the inhibition of VEGF-mediated VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and 
its downstream signal activation in vitro. CAPE blocked VEGF-stimulated 
neovascularization in the Matrigel plugs assay, and reduced vascular 
permeability in mouse skin capillaries in vivo. CAPE inhibited the growth and 
neovascularization of primary tumor cells in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice inoculated 
with Lewis lung carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and melanoma cells. These results 
suggest that CAPE negatively modulates VEGF-induced angiogenesis by suppressing 
VEGFR-2 activation, and might be a therapeutic avenue for anti-angiogenesis.
