Very recently, the circadian rhythm was proved to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of arthritis. The role of melatonin in the development and progress 
of rheumatoid arthritis has been implicated for decades. This study was aimed to 
investigate the effect of melatonin on the expression of circadian clock genes 
in mouse anti-type II collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice were 
divided into 3 groups: control, CIA, and CIA + melatonin treatment (MLT). Both 
mRNA and protein levels of circadian clock gene Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) were 
markedly decreased in CIA + MEL group compared with those in control and CIA 
groups. MLT increased paw thickness. Histologic and X-ray assessment also 
revealed increased infiltration of inflammatory cells, synovial hyperplasia, and 
the destruction of articular cartilage and bone by MLT. The concentrations of 
anti-type II collagen antibody in CIA + MEL group mice were significantly higher 
than those in control and CIA groups (P < 0.05). Serum concentrations of TNF-α 
(P < 0.005) and IL-6 (P < 0.05) in CIA + MLT group were also increased. Taken 
together, these results implicate that clock gene Cry1 may be involved in the 
aggravation of MLT-mediated arthritis in mice anti-type II collagen 
antibody-induced arthritis.
