OBJECTIVE: To characterise the effects of rituximab on synovial tissue of 
patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Arthroscopic biopsy of knee joint synovium was performed on 6 patients 
with seropositive RA prior to commencing rituximab. Four patients underwent 
repeat biopsy eight weeks following completion of their rituximab infusion 
schedule. Cryostat sections of synovium were prepared and stained with mouse 
monoclonal specific antibodies including CD20, plasma cell antibody and CD68.
RESULTS: Eight weeks after treatment mean DAS28 fell from 6.6+/-0.43 to 
4.7+/-0.49 (p=0.068). Mean CRP fell from 86.7+/-27 mg/L to 20.5+/-7 mg/L 
(p<0.05). Subsynovial CD20+ B cells were demonstrated in all six patients at 
baseline. B cells were completely depleted in two patients at follow-up biopsy. 
Complete depletion was associated with excellent clinical response. No change in 
subsynovial B cells was seen in one patient. One patient's follow-up arthroscopy 
yielded inadequate tissue. A reduction was also seen in subsynovial plasma cells 
and CD68+ cells after treatment.
CONCLUSION: B cells were present in synovial tissue of all patients with 
refractory RA. Complete depletion of B cells was associated with an excellent 
clinical response. These preliminary results suggest that early depletion of 
synovial B cells precedes a decrease in local inflammation leading to clinical 
improvement.
