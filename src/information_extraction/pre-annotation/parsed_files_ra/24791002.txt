B cell activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine of tumor necrosis factor family 
mainly produced by monocytes and dendritic cells. BAFF can regulate the 
proliferation, differentiation, and survival of B lymphocytes by binding with 
BAFF-R on B cell membrane. Accumulating evidences showed that BAFF played 
crucial roles and was overexpressed in various autoimmune diseases such as 
systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This suggests 
that BAFF may be a therapeutic target for these diseases. In the present study, 
we developed a BAFF therapeutic vaccine by coupling a T helper cell epitope 
AKFVAAWTLKAA (PADRE) to the N terminus of BAFF extracellular domains 
(PADRE-BAFF) and expressed this fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The purified 
vaccine can induce high titer of neutralizing BAFF antibodies and ameliorate the 
syndrome of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced rheumatoid arthritis in 
rats. Our data indicated that the BAFF autovaccine may be a useful candidate for 
the treatment of some autoimmune diseases associated with high level of BAFF.
