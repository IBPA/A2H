Sinomenine is one of the alkaloids extracted from Chinese medical plant, 
Sinomenium acutum Rehder et Wilson. Sinomenine has been used for Rheumatoid 
arthritis as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulative drugs. We have so far 
been investigated the cardiovascular pharmacological actions of sinomenine. 
Sinomenine dilated NE (5 μM)-, KCl (60 mM)- and PDB (300 nM)-induced 
vasoconstrictions. The pretreatment with nicardipine (0.1 μM), staurosporine (30 
nM), L-NMMA (100 μM), indomethacin (10 μM) or propranolol significantly 
attenuated the sinomenine-induced vasorelaxation. Therefore, these results 
indicate that sinomenine causes the vasorelaxation by the involvement with the 
inhibitions of Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) and PK-C, β-adrenoceptor stimulation, and 
the activation of NO and PGI(2) syntheses in endothelium. On the other hand, in 
the ventricular cardiomyocytes of guinea pig, sinomenine inhibits I(Ca) and 
simultaneously decreases the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(K)), resulting in 
the prolongation of action potential duration. Sinomenine also suppresses the 
dysrhysmias induced by triggered activities under the Ca(2+) overload condition. 
Therefore, sinomenine may be expected as one of effective therapeutic drugs for 
heart failure and dysrhythmias, and may maintain the cardiovascular functions 
due to modulation of cardiac ionic channels and blood vessels.
