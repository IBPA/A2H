Inhibitory effects of HL-n composed of 95 mol% L-Î±-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholin 
(DMPC) and 5 mol% polyoxyethylenedodecylether (C(12)(EO)(n), n = 21, 23, or 25) 
on the growth of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(HFLS-RA) in vitro were examined. Remarkably high inhibitory effects of HL-n on 
the growth of HFLS-RA cells were obtained. The induction of apoptosis by HL-n 
was revealed on the basis of TUNEL method. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects 
of HL-23 using mouse models of arthritis were investigated. Therapeutic effects 
without joint swelling were obtained in mouse models of RA treated with HL.
