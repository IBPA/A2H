Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the most toxic enzyme found in the azurophilic granules 
of neutrophils. MPO utilizes H2O2 to generate hypochlorous acid (HClO) and other 
reactive moieties, which kill pathogens during infections. In contrast, in the 
setting of sterile inflammation, MPO and MPO-derived oxidants are thought to be 
pathogenic, promoting inflammation and causing tissue damage. In contrast, 
evidence also exists that MPO can limit the extent of immune responses. Elevated 
MPO levels and activity are observed in a number of autoimmune diseases 
including in the central nervous system (CNS) of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the 
joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. A pathogenic role for MPO in 
driving autoimmune inflammation was demonstrated using mouse models. Mechanisms 
whereby MPO is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis include tuning of 
adaptive immune responses and/or the induction of vascular permeability.
