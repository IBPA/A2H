We investigated the presence and alteration of lymphatic vessels in joints of 
arthritic mice using a whole-slide imaging system. Joints and long bone sections 
were cut from paraffin blocks of two mouse models of arthritis: 
meniscal-ligamentous injury (MLI)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) and TNF transgene 
(TNF-Tg)-induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MLI-OA mice were fed a high fat diet 
to accelerate OA development. TNF-Tg mice were treated with lymphatic growth 
factor VEGF-C virus to stimulate lymphangiogenesis. Sections were double 
immunofluorescence stained with anti-podoplanin and alpha-smooth muscle actin 
antibodies. The area and number of lymphatic capillaries and mature lymphatic 
vessels were determined using a whole-slide imaging system and its associated 
software. Lymphatic vessels in joints were distributed in soft tissues mainly 
around the joint capsule, ligaments, fat pads and muscles. In long bones, 
enriched lymphatic vessels were present in the periosteal areas adjacent to the 
blood vessels. Occasionally, lymphatic vessels were observed in the cortical 
bone. Increased lymphatic capillaries, but decreased mature lymphatic vessels, 
were detected in both OA and RA joints. VEGF-C treatment increased lymphatic 
capillary and mature vessel formation in RA joints. Our findings suggest that 
the lymphatic system may play an important role in arthritis pathogenesis and 
treatment.
