BAFF is considered a therapeutic target because dysregulated production of BAFF 
can induce systemic lupus erythematosus-like phenotype in mice, and elevated 
levels of BAFF are associated with disease severity in systemic lupus 
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis patients. Fc fusion decoy receptors, 
BCMA-Fc and BAFF-R-Fc, are therapeutic candidates for blocking BAFF. While 
studying their interactions with BAFF, we found that BAFF-R-Fc is more effective 
than BCMA-Fc for blocking BAFF binding to its receptors. We also found that a 
trimeric BAFF can bind more than one BAFF-R-Fc but only one BCMA-Fc. Moreover, 
we show that, in contrast to monovalent BAFF-R-Fc, monovalent BCMA does not form 
stable complexes with BAFF. Differences in their interaction with BAFF predict 
BAFF-R-Fc would be a better inhibitor. Indeed, we show BAFF-R-Fc is 10-fold more 
efficacious than BCMA-Fc for blocking BAFF-induced B cell proliferation in vitro 
and for blocking BAFF-mediated survival of mouse splenic B lymphocytes in vivo.
