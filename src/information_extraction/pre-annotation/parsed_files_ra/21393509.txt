The growth factor progranulin (PGRN) has been implicated in embryonic 
development, tissue repair, tumorigenesis, and inflammation, but its receptors 
remain unidentified. We report that PGRN bound directly to tumor necrosis factor 
receptors (TNFRs) and disturbed the TNFα-TNFR interaction. PGRN-deficient mice 
were susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, and administration of PGRN 
reversed inflammatory arthritis. Atsttrin, an engineered protein composed of 
three PGRN fragments, exhibited selective TNFR binding. PGRN and Atsttrin 
prevented inflammation in multiple arthritis mouse models and inhibited 
TNFα-activated intracellular signaling. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
that PGRN is a ligand of TNFR, an antagonist of TNFα signaling, and plays a 
critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice. They also 
suggest new potential therapeutic interventions for various TNFα-mediated 
pathologies and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.
