Simiao Wan (SMW), an important multiherbal formula used in traditional Chinese 
medicine, is extensively used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 
knowledge of the bioactive components of SMW remains unclear. Thus, gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to analyze the chemical constituents of volatile 
and nonvolatile extracts of SMW, as well as its absorbed components in rat 
plasma after oral SMW administration. Identification of several compounds was 
enabled by comparison of retention times, MS spectra, and MS/MS spectral data 
with the standard substance and reference materials reported in the literature. 
In the volatile extracts, GC-MS identified 26 compounds in vitro, three of which 
observed in blood by GC-MS. In the nonvolatile extracts, LC-MS identified 49 
compounds in SMW; 18 compounds containing 7 prototype compounds, 5 metabolites, 
and 6 unknown compounds were absorbed by blood. The proposed GC-MS and LC-MS 
method was appropriate not only for the rapid screening and identification of 
multiple components of an SMW extract but also for screening its bioactive 
constituents in vivo. The proposed method could be a promising tool for the 
quality control of other Chinese herbal medicines.
