There has been much interest in strategies which modulate tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and/or function in rheumatoid arthritis. The 
elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic AMP in leukocytes by 
phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors is accompanied by significant inhibition of the 
production of TNF-alpha. Nevertheless, these drugs may enhance the hyperalgesia 
induced by a range of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-alpha. In the 
present study, we examined the effects of the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor 
rolipram on the local inflammatory infiltrate and hyperalgesia in a rat model of 
adjuvant-induced arthritis. Rolipram (3 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 
from day 10 to 14 after disease induction. Pretreatment with rolipram abrogated 
oedema formation and significantly inhibited hyperalgesia. Histopathological 
analysis revealed a marked inhibition of cellular influx as well as bone and 
cartilage destruction. Serum and local TNF-alpha levels were suppressed in 
treated animals whereas there were little changes in interleukin-1beta levels. 
Although cyclic AMP elevating agents may affect nociceptor threshold to increase 
the hyperalgesic responses acutely, they also possess significant 
anti-inflammatory activity, which may hinder local mediator release and/or 
action. The anti-inflammatory effects of rolipram predominate during this 
chronic arthritis model in the rat.
