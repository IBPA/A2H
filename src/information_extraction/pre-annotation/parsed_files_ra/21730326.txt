The antimalaria drug chloroquine has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent for 
treating systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. We report that 
chloroquine promoted the transrepression of proinflammatory cytokines by the 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model, 
chloroquine enhanced the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoid treatment. By 
inhibiting lysosome function, chloroquine synergistically activated 
glucocorticoid signaling. Lysosomal inhibition by either bafilomycin A1 (an 
inhibitor of the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase) or knockdown of 
transcription factor EB (TFEB, a master activator of lysosomal biogenesis) 
mimicked the effects of chloroquine. The abundance of the GR, as well as that of 
the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor, correlated with changes in 
lysosomal biogenesis. Thus, we showed that glucocorticoid signaling is regulated 
by lysosomes, which provides a mechanistic basis for treating inflammation and 
autoimmune diseases with a combination of glucocorticoids and lysosomal 
inhibitors.
