AIM: To observe the effects of sinomenine on the immune functions and apoptosis 
of murine lymphocyte as well as on human synovial fibroblast proliferation.
METHODS: Both in vivo and in vitro tests were adopted. The lymphocyte 
proliferation induced by mitogens was assayed by MTT method. Spleen T lymphocyte 
subtypes were tested with flow cytometry. Spleen lymphocyte apoptosis was 
analyzed by flow cytometry and DNA ladder methods. In vitro test was adopted to 
observe the effects of sinomenine on the proliferation of human fibroblast of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS: Sinomenine can inhibit the proliferation of mouse lymphocytes induced 
by ConA, LPS and anti-CD3 mAb but not PMA in vitro, and inhibit the 
proliferation induced by LPS and PMA in vivo. Sinomenine can reduce up-regulated 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio of T lymphocyte subtype in adjuvant arthritis rat. At the same 
concentration increased apoptosis ratio. As to human synovial fibroblast, 
sinomenine can significantly inhibit proliferation of human fibroblast.
CONCLUSION: Sinomenine can inhibit the immunological function and correct 
imbalance of CD4+/CD8+ ratio of T lymphocyte subtype. It can also increase 
apoptosis ratio of spleen lymphocyte. This may be the mechanism of its 
immunological inhibitory effect.
