The discovery and characterization of 7k (BMS-582949), a highly selective p38α 
MAP kinase inhibitor that is currently in phase II clinical trials for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is described. A key to the discovery was the 
rational substitution of N-cyclopropyl for N-methoxy in 1a, a previously 
reported clinical candidate p38α inhibitor. Unlike alkyl and other cycloalkyls, 
the sp(2) character of the cyclopropyl group can confer improved H-bonding 
characteristics to the directly substituted amide NH. Inhibitor 7k is slightly 
less active than 1a in the p38α enzymatic assay but displays a superior 
pharmacokinetic profile and, as such, was more effective in both the acute 
murine model of inflammation and pseudoestablished rat AA model. The binding 
mode of 7k with p38α was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
