Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and rat models of RA exhibit symmetrical mirror-image 
spread. Many studies have sought to understand the underlying mechanisms and 
have reported contralateral effects that are manifested in many different forms. 
It is now well accepted that neurogenic mechanisms contribute to the symmetrical 
spread of inflammation. However, very few investigators have directly assessed 
changes in contralateral nerve function and there is a paucity of data. In the 
present study our aim was to investigate whether there are changes, in 
particular in the nervous system but also in the vascular system contralateral 
to an inflamed rat knee joint, that might precede overt inflammation and 
symmetrical spread. Three to five days following Complete Freund's Adjuvant 
(CFA) injection we found spontaneous antidromic (away from the CNS) activity in 
the homologous sensory nerve contralateral to the inflamed joint. Antidromic 
activity of this nature is known to result in the peripheral release of 
pro-inflammatory and vasoactive neuropeptides. Importantly, this activity was 
modulated by systemic analgesic treatment. Furthermore, levels of Evans blue dye 
extravasation were significantly increased in the joint contralateral to 
inflammation, indicating altered vascular function. These data suggest that 
contralateral increases in sensory neural activity and vascular function may 
account for the symmetrical spread of RA, and that early analgesic treatment may 
prevent or delay the spread of this debilitating disease.
