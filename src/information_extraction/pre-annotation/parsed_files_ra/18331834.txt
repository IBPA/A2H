Synoviocyte hyperplasia is critical for rheumatoid arthritis, therefore, 
potentially an important target for therapeutics. It was found in this work that 
a TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, and acidic solution (pH 5.5) induced increases in 
cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production in synoviocytes isolated from a rat model of collagen-induced 
arthritis. The increases in both [Ca(2+)](c) and ROS production were completely 
abolished in calcium-free buffer or by a TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine. Further 
experiments revealed that capsaicin and pH 5.5 solution caused mitochondrial 
membrane depolarization and reduction in cell viability; such effects were 
inhibited by capsazepine, or the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium. 
Both capsaicin and pH 5.5 buffer induced apoptosis as shown by nuclear 
condensation and fragmentation. Furthermore, RT-PCR readily detected TRPV1 mRNA 
expression in the isolated synoviocytes. Taken together, these data indicated 
that TRPV1 activation triggered synoviocyte death by [Ca(2+)](c) elevation, ROS 
production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization.
