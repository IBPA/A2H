RATIONALE: High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a potent inflammatory mediator 
elevated in sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis, although its role in cystic 
fibrosis (CF) lung disease is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether HMGB1 contributes to CF lung inflammation, 
including neutrophil chemotaxis and lung matrix degradation.
METHODS: We used sputum and serum from subjects with CF and a Scnn1b-transgenic 
(Scnn1b-Tg) mouse model that overexpresses beta-epithelial Na(+) channel in 
airways and mimics the CF phenotype, including lung inflammation. Human 
secretions and murine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was assayed for HMGB1 
by Western blot and ELISA. Neutrophil chemotaxis was measured in vitro after 
incubation with human neutrophils. The collagen fragment proline-glycine-proline 
(PGP) was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: HMGB1 was detected in CF sputum at higher levels 
than secretions from normal individuals. Scnn1b-Tg mice had elevated levels of 
HMGB1 by Western blot and ELISA. We demonstrated that dose-dependent chemotaxis 
of human neutrophils stimulated by purified HMGB1 was partially dependent on CXC 
chemokine receptors and that this could be duplicated in CF sputum and BALF from 
Scnn1b-Tg mice. Neutralization by anti-HMGB1 antibody, in both the sputum and 
BALF-reduced chemotaxis, which suggested that HMGB1 contributed to the 
chemotactic properties of these samples. Intratracheal administration of 
purified HMGB1 induced neutrophil influx into the airways of mice and promoted 
the release of PGP. PGP was also elevated in Scnn1b-Tg mice and CF serum.
CONCLUSIONS: HMGB1 expression contributes to pulmonary inflammation and lung 
matrix degradation in CF airway disease and deserves further investigation as a 
biomarker and potential therapeutic target.
