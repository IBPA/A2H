The development of highly immunodeficient mouse strains has allowed the 
reconstitution of functional human immune system components in mice. 
New-generation humanized mice generated in this manner have been extensively 
used for modeling viral infections that are exclusively human tropic. 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected humanized mice reproduce cardinal features of 
EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and EBV-associated 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Erosive arthritis morphologically 
resembling rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has also been recapitulated in these mice. 
Low-dose EBV infection of humanized mice results in asymptomatic, persistent 
infection. Innate immune responses involving natural killer cells, EBV-specific 
adaptive T-cell responses restricted by human major histocompatibility and 
EBV-specific antibody responses are also elicited in humanized mice. 
EBV-associated T-/natural killer cell lymphoproliferative disease, by contrast, 
can be reproduced in a distinct mouse xenograft model. In this review, recent 
findings on the recapitulation of human EBV infection and pathogenesis in these 
mouse models, as well as their application to preclinical studies of 
experimental anti-EBV therapies, are described.
