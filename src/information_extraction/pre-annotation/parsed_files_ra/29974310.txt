Triptolide has been widely reported to exhibit potential therapeutic value in 
multiple inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and psoriasis. Although its safety and efficacy as an 
anti-inflammatory agent have been verified by many studies, the effect of 
triptolide on osteoarthritis (OA) was not clearly understood. In this study, we 
found that triptolide prevented OA development in a surgical destabilization of 
the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. In addition, triptolide inhibited both 
DMM-induced and LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the 
human monocytic cell line THP-1. Further mechanistic studies showed that the 
reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by triptolide was mediated by the 
upregulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family 
pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and downregulation of caspase-1. 
Finally, we identified that hsa-miR-20b, a microRNA targeting the NLRP3 gene, 
was downregulated by triptolide. This study provides a novel insight into the 
effect on triptolide in preventing OA pathogenesis.
