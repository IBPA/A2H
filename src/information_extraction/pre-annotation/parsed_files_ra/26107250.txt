Dendritic cells (DCs) play important roles in initiation of the pathogenic 
processes of autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) are generated from na√Øve DCs and induce T 
cell tolerance; thus, they represent a promising strategy for specific cellular 
therapy for autoimmune diseases. In this study, we generated green fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-labeled tolDCs and confirmed their phenotypes and biological 
functions. We found that tolDCs suppressed the memory lymphocyte response and 
exhibited strong tolerogenic potential; thus, these cells show promise for the 
treatment of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, a collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) mouse model was used to test the role of tolDCs in vivo. The results of a 
further mechanistic experiment revealed that tolDCs suppressed inflammatory 
arthritis at least partially by up-regulating regulatory T (Treg) cells. 
Collectively, our data suggest that tolDCs may be used as a promising 
alternative therapy for inflammatory arthritis.
