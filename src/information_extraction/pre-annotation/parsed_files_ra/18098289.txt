Pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) is expressed in central, 
sensory, autonomic, and enteric neurons. Although it classically acts as a 
neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, recent studies indicate that PACAP can also 
regulate immune function. To this effect, PACAP has been shown to reduce 
clinical symptoms and inflammation in mouse models of human immune-based 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's Disease, septic shock and 
multiple sclerosis. Despite these findings, the role of the endogenous peptide 
in regulating immune function is unknown. To determine if endogenous PACAP plays 
a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD-associated 
colorectal cancer in mice, PACAP-deficient (KO) mice were subjected to 3 cycles 
of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water over 2 months, an established 
mouse model for colitis. Compared to wild type (WT) controls, PACAP KO mice 
exhibited more severe clinical symptoms of colitis and had significantly higher 
colonic inflammation on pathological examination. Moreover, 60% of the PACAP KO 
mice developed colorectal tumors with an aggressive-appearing pathology. 
Consistent with published data, DSS-treated WT mice did not develop such tumors. 
The results demonstrate a new mouse model which rapidly develops 
inflammation-associated colorectal cancer in the absence of a carcinogen.
