The ST2L receptor for interleukin 33 (IL-33) mediates pulmonary inflammation and 
immune system-related disorders, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. At 
present, very little is known about the molecular regulation of ST2L expression. 
Here we found that FBXL19, an 'orphan' member of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box family of 
E3 ubiquitin ligases, selectively bound to ST2L to mediate its 
polyubiquitination and elimination in the proteasome. Degradation of ST2L 
involved phosphorylation of ST2L at Ser442 catalyzed by the kinase GSK3Î². 
Overexpression of FBXL19 abrogated the proapoptotic and inflammatory effects of 
IL-33 and lessened the severity of lung injury in mouse models of pneumonia. Our 
results suggest that modulation of the IL-33-ST2L axis by ubiquitin ligases 
might serve as a unique strategy for lessening pulmonary inflammation.
