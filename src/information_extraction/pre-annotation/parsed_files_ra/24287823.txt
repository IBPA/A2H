This study analyzes the effect of interleukin-15 (IL-15) on osteoclast formation 
using a coculture of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells (BMCs) stimulated 
with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which both have important role in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease (PD). BMCs isolate lacking T (BM(T-)) or 
NK (BM(NK-)) cells, BMCs with no cells removed (BM(T+NK+)), purified NK cells, 
and purified T cells were each cocultured with osteoblasts in the presence or 
absence of PGE2 and/or IL-15. The number of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts was 
decreased by IL-15 in a dose-dependent manner in BM(T+NK+), BM(T-). However, the 
reductions were improved in BM(NK-). The expression of caspase3 in osteoblasts 
cocultured with NK cells was increased in a dose-dependent manner by IL-15. 
IL-15 stimulates apoptosis of osteoblasts via activation of NK cells. Since 
osteoblasts have an important role in bone formation, IL-15 may be an 
inflammatory bone destructive factor in RA and PD.
