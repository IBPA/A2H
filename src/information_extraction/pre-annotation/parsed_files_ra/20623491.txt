BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that 
causes inflammation and destruction of the joints. In the collagen-induced 
arthritis mouse model of RA, we developed a nonviral gene therapy method 
designed to block in situ the main cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
METHODS: Electrotransfer was used to deliver a plasmid encoding extracellular 
domain of mouse soluble TNF-alpha receptor type I fused to the Fc fragment of 
mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 (pTNFR-Is) corresponding to a dimeric TNF-alpha 
soluble receptor fusion protein (mTNFR-Is/Ig).
RESULTS: Delivery of the plasmid into the knees at symptom onset improved the 
histological inflammation and destruction not only at the knees, but also at the 
ankles, indicating a local and a regional therapeutic effect. The plasmid was 
detected in synovial membrane and meniscus specimens from the injected joints. 
In the synovial membrane, 15 days post-injection, interleukin (IL)-17 and 
TNF-alpha mRNAs expression were increased, whereas IL-10 mRNA was unchanged. 
However, the empty plasmid exerted a pro-inflammatory effect 30 days 
post-injection.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that local nonviral gene therapy against 
TNF-alpha is effective, although further work is needed to decrease plasmid 
induced inflammation.
