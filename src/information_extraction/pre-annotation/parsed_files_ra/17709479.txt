TNF-alpha, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, is synthesized as a 
membrane-anchored precursor and proteolytically released from cells. Soluble TNF 
is the primary mediator of pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's 
disease, and endotoxin shock. The TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), a 
disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), has emerged as the best candidate 
TNF sheddase, but other proteinases can also release TNF. Because TACE-deficient 
mice die shortly after birth, we generated conditional TACE-deficient mice to 
address whether TACE is the relevant sheddase for TNF in adult mice. In this 
study, we report that TACE inactivation in myeloid cells or temporal 
inactivation at 6 wk offers strong protection from endotoxin shock lethality in 
mice by preventing increased TNF serum levels. These findings corroborate that 
TACE is the major endotoxin-stimulated TNF sheddase in mouse myeloid cells in 
vivo, thereby further validating TACE as a principal target for the treatment of 
TNF-dependent pathologies.
