Rheumatoid arthritis is a T lymphocyte-mediated disorder, but the precise nature 
of T cell involvement remains unclear. In the K/BxN mouse model of inflammatory 
arthritis, T cells initiate disease by providing help to B cells to produce 
arthritogenic autoantibodies. Here, we have characterized an additional, 
nonhumoral role for T cells in promoting autoantibody-induced arthritis. 
Autoreactive KRN T cells introduced either by direct transfer or bone marrow 
transplantation into B-cell-deficient hosts enhanced K/BxN serum-transferred 
arthritis, an effect that was dependent on expression of the cognate 
MHC-molecule/peptide complex. The T cell influence was dependent on interleukin 
(IL)-17; in contrast, standard serum-transferred arthritis, unenhanced by the 
addition of T cells, was unaffected by IL-17 neutralization. An IL-17-producing 
population of transferred KRN T cells was identified and found to be supported 
by the cotransfer of arthritogenic autoantibodies. IL-17-producing KRN T cells 
were enriched in inflamed joints of K/BxN mice, suggesting either selective 
recruitment or preferential differentiation. These results demonstrate the 
potential for autoreactive T cells to play two roles in the development of 
arthritis, both driving the production of pathogenic autoantibodies and 
bolstering the subsequent inflammatory cascade dependent on the innate immune 
system.
