The anti-inflammatory compound, alphitonin-4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), has 
previously been isolated in the leaves of Artokapus tonkinensis and synthesised 
from taxifolin. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of this 
compound on inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-10, in RAW264.7 macrophages and in an 
arthritis animal model. Compound 1 dose-dependently decreased the production of 
TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In 
contrast, the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased. In a collagen 
antibody-induced arthritis BALB/c mouse model, compound 1 at a dose of 125 and 
250 mg/kg body weight significantly decreased arthritis incidence in comparison 
with dexamethasone.
