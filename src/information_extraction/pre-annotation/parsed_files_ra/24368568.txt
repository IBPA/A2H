In the present study we provide evidence that solomonsterol A, a selective 
pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist isolated from the marine sponge Theonella 
swinhoei, exerts anti-inflammatory activity and attenuates systemic inflammation 
and immune dysfunction in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Solomonsterol A 
was effective in protecting against the development of arthritis induced by 
injecting transgenic mice harboring a humanized PXR, with anti-collagen 
antibodies (CAIA) with beneficial effects on joint histopathology and local 
inflammatory response reducing the expression of inflammatory markers (TNFα, 
IFNγ and IL-17 and chemokines MIP1α and RANTES) in draining lymph nodes. 
Solomonsterol A rescued mice from systemic inflammation were assessed by 
measuring arthritis score, CRP and cytokines in the blood. In summary, the 
present study provides a molecular basis for the regulation of systemic local 
and systemic immunity by PXR agonists.
