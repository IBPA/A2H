Two-way communication between the mammalian nervous and immune systems is 
increasingly recognized and appreciated. An intriguing example of such crosstalk 
comes from clinical observations dating from the 1930s: Patients who suffer a 
stroke and then develop rheumatoid arthritis atypically present with arthritis 
on only one side, the one not afflicted with paralysis. Here we successfully 
modeled hemiplegia-induced protection from arthritis using the K/BxN 
serum-transfer system, focused on the effector phase of inflammatory arthritis. 
Experiments entailing pharmacological inhibitors, genetically deficient mouse 
strains, and global transcriptome analyses failed to associate the protective 
effect with a single nerve quality (i.e., with the sympathetic, parasympathetic, 
or sensory nerves). Instead, there was clear evidence that denervation had a 
long-term effect on the limb microvasculature: The rapid and joint-localized 
vascular leak that typically accompanies and promotes serum-transferred 
arthritis was compromised in denervated limbs. This defect was reflected in the 
transcriptome of endothelial cells, the expression of several genes impacting 
vascular leakage or transendothelial cell transmigration being altered in 
denervated limbs. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated pathway to 
dissect and eventually target in inflammatory arthritis.
