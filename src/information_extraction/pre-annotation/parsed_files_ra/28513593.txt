Loss-of-function mutations in the tyrosine kinase JAK3 cause autosomal recessive 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Defects in this form of SCID are 
restricted to the immune system, which led to the development of 
immunosuppressive JAK inhibitors. We find that the B6.Cg-Nr1d1tm1Ven/LazJ mouse 
line purchased from Jackson Laboratories harbors a spontaneous mutation in Jak3, 
generating a SCID phenotype and an inability to generate antigen-independent 
professional cytokine-producing innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Mechanistically, 
Jak3 deficiency blocks ILC differentiation in the bone marrow at the ILC 
precursor and the pre-NK cell progenitor. We further demonstrate that the 
pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib and the specific JAK3 inhibitor PF-06651600 impair 
the ability of human intraepithelial ILC1 (iILC1) to produce IFN-Î³, without 
affecting ILC3 production of IL-22. Both inhibitors impaired the proliferation 
of iILC1 and ILC3 and differentiation of human ILC in vitro. Tofacitinib is 
currently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid 
arthritis. Both tofacitinib and PF-06651600 are currently in clinical trials for 
several other immune-mediated conditions. Our data suggest that therapeutic 
inhibition of JAK may also impact ILCs and, to some extent, underlie clinical 
efficacy.
