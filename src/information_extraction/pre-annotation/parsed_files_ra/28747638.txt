In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLS) is the cause of chronic inflammation in joints and of joint damage. 
Delivery of the pro-apoptotic gene PUMA to FLS via human adenovirus type 5 
(HAdV5) vectors has been tested as a therapeutic approach, but efficiency is 
hampered by low transduction, as FLS do not express HAdV5 receptors on the cell 
surface. Here we show that efficient transduction of PUMA in FLS can be achieved 
by conjugating HAdV5 to a baculovirus, which binds to the cell surface via the 
envelope glycoprotein Gp64. Intra-articular injection in an adjuvant-induced rat 
model of RA induces apoptosis of FLS, leading to significant decrease in joint 
inflammation, joint damage, and bone loss with improvement in joint function and 
mobility. Our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of PUMA gene therapy 
as a local treatment in various forms of arthritis in which abnormal FLS 
proliferation is implicated.Proliferation of synoviocytes contributes to joint 
damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Here the authors show that targeting of these 
cells by a vector, consisting of a baculovirus conjugated to an adenovirus 
carrying the pro-apoptotic gene PUMA, has therapeutic efficacy in a rat 
arthritis model.
