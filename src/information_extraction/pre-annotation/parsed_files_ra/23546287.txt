Osteoclasts are responsible for bone erosion in diseases as diverse as 
osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Antiseptic products have 
received recent attention as potential therapeutic and preventive drugs in human 
disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the 
antiseptic cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) on osteoclast formation using mouse 
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). CPC inhibited receptor activator of 
nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation in a 
dose-dependent manner without causing cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression of 
cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor (CTR), and Prdm1 in osteoclasts was reduced by 
CPC. In experiments to elucidate its mechanism of action, CPC was found to 
suppress RANKL-induced expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T 
cells (NFATc1), transcription factors that are essential for osteoclast 
differentiation. CPC also inhibited RANKL-induced activation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-κB and expression of cyclooxygenase 
(COX)-2. These results collectively suggest that CPC inhibits osteoclast 
differentiation by suppressing the activation of ERK and NF-κB and reducing the 
expression of COX-2, c-Fos, and NFATc1. CPC may therefore be a useful drug in 
the prevention of bone loss.
