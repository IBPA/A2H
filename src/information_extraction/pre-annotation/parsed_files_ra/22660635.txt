Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-17 (IL-17) promote inflammatory 
autoimmune diseases. Although several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to 
regulate autoimmune pathogenesis by affecting lymphocyte development and 
function, the role of miRNAs in resident cells present in inflammatory lesions 
remains unclear. Here we show that miR-23b is downregulated in inflammatory 
lesions of humans with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in the mouse 
models of lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. IL-17 downregulates 
miR-23b expression in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes, mouse primary kidney 
cells and astrocytes and is essential for the downregulation of miR-23b during 
autoimmune pathogenesis. In turn, miR-23b suppresses IL-17-, tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α)- or IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine 
expression by targeting TGF-β-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 
(TAB2), TAB3 and inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B kinase subunit α (IKK-α) and, 
consequently, represses autoimmune inflammation. Thus, IL-17 contributes to 
autoimmune pathogenesis by suppressing miR-23b expression in radio-resident 
cells and promoting proinflammatory cytokine expression.
