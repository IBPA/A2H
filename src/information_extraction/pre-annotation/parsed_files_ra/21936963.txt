Arthritis is a heterogeneous disease comprising a group of inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory conditions that can cause pain, stiffness and swelling in the 
joints. Mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been critical for 
identifying genetic and cellular mechanisms of RA and several new mouse models 
have been produced. Various methods have been applied to induce experimental 
models of arthritis in animals that would provide important insights into the 
etiopathogenetic mechanisms of human RA. Adipue and colleagues recently 
discovered that mice in their breeding colony spontaneously developed inflamed 
joints reminiscent of RA and may, therefore, have found a new model to examine 
pathogenic mechanisms and test new treatments for this human inflammatory 
disease.
