ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Genkwa flos (Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc.), a 
Chinese herbal medicine, has been traditionally used for over two thousand years 
in China for inflammation related symptoms, including joint pain. To evaluate 
the antioxidative effects of flavonoid aglycones (FA) isolated from Genkwa flos 
on adjuvant arthritis in rats and to identify the relationship between 
antioxidant potential and whole blood viscosity (WBV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: FA compounds were identified using LC-MS and the content 
was assayed by HPLC. Arthritis was induced by an intradermal injection of 
Freund×³s complete adjuvant in the footpad. The effects of FA on paw volumes, 
secondary arthritis scores, histopathology of joints, and body and organ weights 
were measured. The antioxidant effects of FA and WBV were determined.
RESULTS: LC-MS analysis showed that the FA contained four major compounds: 
luteolin, apigenin, hydroxygenkwanin and genkwanin. FA significantly decreased 
paw edema, arthritis scores, and weight loss. These observations were consistent 
with the reduction of oxidative stress and the improvement of the WBV.
CONCLUSION: FA significantly decreased arthritis in a rat model through 
antioxidant and hemorheological modulatory mechanisms. The Genkwa flos 
flavonoids may have clinical potential for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
