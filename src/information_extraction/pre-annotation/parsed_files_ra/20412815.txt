IL-33 plays an important role in inflammatory diseases including hypersensitive 
diseases like asthma, autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, 
cardiovascular diseases like heart failure and neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease. Here we reported the generation of an IL-33 transgenic 
mouse, in which mouse IL-33 full-length cDNA was controlled under the CMV 
promoter. The transgenic IL-33 was released as a cleaved form with molecular 
weight of 18kDa in pulmonary, nephritic, cardiac and pancreatic tissues in 
transgenic mice and the pI of 18kDa peptide was about pH 3-5 on the 2D PAGE 
which was similar with the activated peptide of IL-33. Histological analysis 
showed massive airway inflammation with infiltration of eosinophils around 
bronchi and small blood vessels, hyperplasia of goblet cells and accumulation of 
mucus-like material in pulmonary tissue of transgenic mice. An increase of IL-5, 
IL-8, IL-13 and IgE was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 
transgenic mice, which are inflammatory factors. These findings suggest 
transgenic IL-33 could be cleaved and secreted in an activated form and play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation.
