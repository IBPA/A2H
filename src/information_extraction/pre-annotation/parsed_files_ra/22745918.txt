Dermal drug delivery system that is required to localizes methotrexate (MTX) in 
the synovial joint is needed to treat inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The present investigation aims at exploring the potential of fatty acid vesicles 
for the topical delivery of methotrexate. Vesicles were prepared by film 
hydration method using oleic acid as a fatty acid principal component. Developed 
vesicles were characterized for size, size distribution, shape, in vitro 
release, pH dependent, and storage stability. Interaction between MTX and oleic 
acid was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The MTX amount 
permeated through rat skin was three- to fourfold higher using oleic acid 
compared to those from plain drug solution or carbopol gel. At the end of the 
skin permeation assay using ufasomes, up to 50% of the administered dose was 
found in the skin. These results suggest that methotrexate encapsulated in oleic 
acid vesicles may be of value for the topical administration of MTX in the 
treatment of psoriasis.
