No curative treatment is yet available for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), wherein 
chronic synovitis progresses to cartilage and bone destruction. Considering the 
recently recognized anti-inflammatory properties of Lycium barbarum 
polysaccharide (LBP; a derivative of the goji berry), we established the 
collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model to investigate the 
potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of LBP. The CIA-induced changes and 
LBP-related effects were assessed by micro-computed tomography measurement of 
bone volume/tissue volume and by ELISA and western blotting detection of 
inflammatory mediators and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The CIA mice showed 
substantial bone damage, bone loss, and increased concentrations of TNF-Î±, IL-6, 
IL-17, PGE2, MIP-1, anti-type II collagen IgG, MMP-1, and MMP-3. LBP treatments 
produced significant dose-dependent improvements in CIA-induced bone damage and 
bone loss, and significantly reduced CIA-stimulated expression of the 
inflammatory mediators and MMPs. Thus, LBP therapy can preserve bone integrity 
in CIA mice, possibly through down-regulation of inflammatory mediators.
