Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a Tec family kinase with a well-defined role 
in the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway. It has become an attractive kinase target 
for selective B cell inhibition and for the treatment of B cell related 
diseases. We report a series of compounds based on 
8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine that are potent reversible BTK inhibitors with 
excellent kinase selectivity. Selectivity is achieved through specific 
interactions of the ligand with the kinase hinge and driven by aminopyridine 
hydrogen bondings with Ser538 and Asp539, and by hydrophobic interaction of 
trifluoropyridine in the back pocket. These interactions are evident in the 
X-ray crystal structure of the lead compounds 1 and 3 in the complex with the 
BTK enzyme. Our lead compounds show desirable PK profiles and efficacy in the 
preclinical rat collagen induced arthritis model.
