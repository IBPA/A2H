Immune complexes from the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 
or artificial rheumatoid factors (RF)-like (antibody--antibody) immune 
complexes, induce a remarkably intense, sustained and selective immunoglobulin 
(Ig)G1 response under certain experimental conditions in mice. Because the IgG1 
antibody response is extraordinarily strong, the role of interleukin (IL)-4, 
important for IgG1 synthesis, was investigated. Both C57BL/6 and NZB 
IL-4-deficient mice produced IgG1--RF antibodies after injection with RF-like 
immune complexes, although the antibody levels were slightly delayed compared to 
wild type mice. This shows that IL-4 is not obligatory in RF-like immune complex 
induced IgG1--RF production. A discrepancy in the decline of serum IgG1--RF was 
noted between NZB and C57Bl/6 mice. Serum IgG1-RF declined 43 days postinjection 
(p.i.), in C57BL/6 mice whereas high serum levels of IgG1--RF were maintained 
more than 100 days in the NZB mice, indicating different regulatory mechanisms 
in these mice. To study if the affinity for mouse IgG increased with time in NZB 
mice and thus become more directed against self, the cross-reactivity of the 
IgG1--RF antibodies with IgG from other species was investigated early and late 
after injection. It was, however, found that the cross-reactivity with IgG of 
human, goat and rabbit origin did not change between the two time points.
