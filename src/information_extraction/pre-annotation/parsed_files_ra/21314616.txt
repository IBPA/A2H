Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a polyfunctional cytokine, one of the key 
mediators of inflammation and innate immunity. On the other hand, systemic or 
local TNF overexpression is typical of such pathological states as rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, septic shock, and multiple sclerosis. 
Neutralization of TNF activity has a marked curative effect for some diseases; 
therefore, the search for various TNF blockers is a promising field of protein 
engineering and biotechnology. According to the previously developed concept 
concerning the possibility of designing dominant-negative mutants, the following 
TNF variants have been studied: TNFY87H + A145R, TNFY87H + A96S + A145R, and 
TNFV91N + A145R. All of these form inactive TNF heterotrimers with the native 
protein. The ability of mutants to neutralize the effect of TNF was 
investigated. The addition of mutants to the native protein was shown to provide 
a concentration-dependent suppression of TNF cytotoxicity against the mouse 
fibroblast cell line L929. Thus, novel inhibitors of human TNF can be engineered 
on the basis of these muteins.
