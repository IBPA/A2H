The adeno-associated viruses (AAV) offer new perspectives for cytokine gene 
transfer in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because they are nonpathogenic and allow 
long-term transgene expression in vivo. Moreover, the use of a 
tetracycline-inducible promoter allows regulation of therapeutic gene 
expression. This study assessed the potential long-term gene regulation of a 
recombinant AAV vector expressing viral interleukin-10 (vIL-10) in human 
rheumatoid synovium and the therapeutic efficiency in a mouse model of RA. We 
constructed a recombinant AAV vector in which the transcription of vIL-10 cDNA 
is controlled by the TetON system. Transduction of human primary RA synovial 
cells with AAV-tetON-vIL10 conferred in vitro controlled vIL-10 expression. 
After intramuscular injection, both incidence and severity of collagen-induced 
arthritis were significantly reduced at macroscopic, radiological, and 
histological levels in the group of DBA1 mice treated with AAV-TetON-vIL10 
vector plus doxycycline after immunization and boosting compared to control 
groups. When coinjecting two separate AAV vectors, one encoding the inducible 
vIL-10 and the other the transcriptional activator, a 10 times excess of the 
transactivator vector dose allowed efficient control of vIL-10 secretion by 
doxycycline administration or withdrawal, over an 8-week period. Our results 
supported, for the first time, the utility of AAV-tetON-vIL10 as a therapeutic 
tool for gene therapy in RA.
