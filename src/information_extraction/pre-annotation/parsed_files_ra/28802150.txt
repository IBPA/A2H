Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are a key serological marker of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To investigate whether miR-let7a downregulated 
ACPA-induced macrophage activation and arthritis, miR-let7a levels were assessed 
in the synovial fluid from patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, 
expression of the pro-inflammatory genes HMGA2, PI3K, and IRF5 was examined in 
ACPA-induced macrophages and a collagen antibody-induced mouse model of 
arthritis. As expected, miR-let7a expression in synovial fluid macrophages was 
substantially lower in patients with RA than in those with OA. Moreover, ACPAs 
treatment (160IU/mL) suppressed miR-let7a expression in macrophages isolated 
from patients with RA. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-let7a directly 
targets HMGA2 to suppress ACPA-induced IRF5 expression through PI3K in 
macrophages. Further, miR-let7a expression was markedly decreased in swollen 
ankle tissue and splenocytes isolated from arthritic mice, whereas HMGA2, PI3K, 
and IRF5 expression positively correlated with disease severity. However, 
injection miR-let7a agomir was unable to mitigate the development of 
experimental arthritis in model mice. Collectively, these data demonstrated that 
miR-let7a directly targets HMGA2 to downregulate ACPAs-induced macrophage 
activation, and correlated with experimental RA severity.
