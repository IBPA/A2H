The effects of a new generation bisphosphonate, incadronate, in established 
adjuvant arthritis rats were evaluated according to the arthritis index, hind 
paw volume, and radiological and histopathological examinations. Incadronate 
suppressed the radiological and histopathological changes of hind paws, as well 
as the joint swelling in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the arthritis 
control rats showed drastic joint inflammation, marked destruction of bone and 
articular cartilage. The remains of articular cartilage lost Safranin O 
staining, and were attached with numerous TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. Some 
of resorption lacunas could be seen at the cartilage matrix nearby the 
TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. As regards the chondroprotective effects of 
bisphosphonates, we speculate that it is probably concerned with the inhibition 
of the chondroclasts. These data indicate that bisphosphonates may be a class of 
effective agent that can be considered for treatment of various arthritic 
conditions, including human rheumatoid arthritis.
