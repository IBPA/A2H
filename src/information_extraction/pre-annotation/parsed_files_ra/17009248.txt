OBJECTIVE: : Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by hyperplasia of the 
synovial lining, inflammation, and destruction of cartilage and bone. Since 
there are only a few detectable cells undergoing apoptosis in the joint, it is 
possible that a defect in apoptosis may contribute to synovial hyperplasia. This 
study sought to identify and characterize the direct role of apoptotic 
regulators in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: Using a serum transfer model, experimental arthritis was induced in 
mice lacking the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family genes Bak (Bak-/-), Bax (Bax-/-), or 
Bim (Bim-/-), as compared with wild-type (WT) control mice. Physical examination 
for edema of the ankles and histopathologic analysis of ankle sections were used 
to determine the severity of arthritis. The serum and ankles were examined for 
production of chemokines and cytokines using enzyme-linked immunosorbent or 
Luminex-based assays.
RESULTS: Bim-/- mice displayed increased severity and prolongation of arthritis. 
In contrast, Bak-/- and Bax-/- mice showed no difference in the severity of 
arthritis as compared with WT mice. In addition, Bim-/- mice had elevated levels 
of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, decreased joint and serum 
production of antiinflammatory cytokines, fewer TUNEL-positive cells, and 
reduced levels of active caspase 3 as compared with WT mice.
CONCLUSION: These studies are the first to demonstrate a role for the 
proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bim in the effector phase of RA. The findings 
indicate that Bim potentially functions to repress the effector phase of 
arthritis by regulating the milieu of the joint and serum, and by inducing 
apoptosis.
