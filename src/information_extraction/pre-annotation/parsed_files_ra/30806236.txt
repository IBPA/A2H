Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is an organosulfur compound derived mainly from garlic 
and genus Allium plants, which possess diverse biological properties. The aim of 
the present study was to evaluate the antiarthritic activity of DADS in rats 
with arthritis induced using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). DADS (20 mg/kg 
and 50 mg/kg) was administered and tested against CFA-induced arthritic rats by 
assessing various parameters: body weight, paw volume, arthritic score, organ 
indices (spleen and thymus), hematological and biochemical parameters, and 
proinflammatory cytokines. Histopathological analyses were also performed. The 
treatment of rats with DADS provoked significant reductions in paw volume, edema 
formation, arthritic score, and organ indices, together with significant 
improvement in body weight. DADS treatment also improved joint destruction and 
reduced inflammation, which was supported by histopathological studies. DADS 
significantly reduced the white blood cell count and improved red blood cell 
count in CFA-induced rats. The anti-arthritic activity in the CFA-induced rats 
was further confirmed by biochemical analysis. These findings suggest that DADS 
prevented cartilage destruction, improved health status, and reduced 
inflammation by decreasing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in 
arthritis-induced rats. Hence, DADS may be a potential therapeutic candidate for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
