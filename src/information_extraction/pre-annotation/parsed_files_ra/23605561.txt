Sinomenine (SIN) is the active principle of the Chinese medical plant Sinomenium 
acutum which is widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
China. Recently, several groups indicated that myeloid differentiation primary 
response protein 88 (MyD88) might be associated with disease progression of RA. 
Here, we observed the effect of SIN on MyD88 expression and showed its 
therapeutic role in RA. First, immunohistochemical staining in clinical 
specimens showed that MyD88 was mainly located in characteristic pathological 
structures of RA synovial tissues. Second, we found that MyD88 was overexpressed 
in the synovial tissues of the rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). 
Treatment with SIN markedly decreased the expression of MyD88 in AIA rats. 
Finally, we provided evidences that SIN suppressed inflammation response and 
inflammation-induced joint destructive progression and arthritis symptoms in AIA 
rats. Therefore, SIN is an effective therapeutic agent for RA. Targeting MyD88 
signaling may provide new methods for the treatment of RA.
