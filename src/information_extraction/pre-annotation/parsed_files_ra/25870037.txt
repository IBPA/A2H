Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid found in many vegetables and fruits. 
Epidemiologic studies have described that Kaempferol intake could reduce risk of 
cancer, especially lung, gastric, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Recent studies 
have shown that Kaempferol could also be beneficial to the body to defend 
against inflammation, and infection by bacteria and viruses; however, the 
molecular mechanism of its immunoregulatory function remains largely unknown. 
Through screening a small molecule library of traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), we identified that Kaempferol could enhance the suppressive function of 
regulatory T cells (Tregs). Kaempferol was found to increase FOXP3 expression 
level in Treg cells and prevent pathological symptoms of collagen-induced 
arthritis in a rat animal model. Kaempferol could also reduce PIM1-mediated 
FOXP3 phosphorylation at S422. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism that 
underlies the anti-inflammatory action of Kaempferol for the prevention and 
treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis.
