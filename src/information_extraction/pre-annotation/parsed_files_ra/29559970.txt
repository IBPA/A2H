M2 macrophage (Mφ) promotes pathologic angiogenesis through a release of 
pro-angiogenic mediators or the direct cell-cell interaction with endothelium in 
the micromilieu of several chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis and cancer, where interleukin (IL)-18 also contributes to excessive 
angiogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the mechanism by which M2 Mφs in the micromilieu 
containing IL-18 induce excessive angiogenesis in the in vitro experimental 
model using mouse Mφ-like cell line, RAW264.7 cells, and mouse endothelial cell 
line, b.End5 cells. We discovered that IL-18 acts synergistically with IL-10 to 
amplify the production of Mφ-derived mediators like osteopontin (OPN) and 
thrombin, yielding thrombin-cleaved form of OPN generation, which acts through 
integrins α4/α9, thereby augmenting M2 polarization of Mφ with characteristics 
of increasing surface CD163 expression in association with morphological 
alteration. Furthermore, the results of visualizing temporal behavior and 
morphological alteration of Mφs during angiogenesis demonstrated that M2-like 
Mφs induced excessive angiogenesis through the direct cell-cell interaction with 
endothelial cells, possibly mediated by CD163.
