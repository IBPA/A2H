Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) have been invoked in the pathogenesis of a variety of 
autoimmune diseases. The mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65) has been 
studied extensively as one of the antigenic triggers of autoimmunity in 
experimental models of, as well as patients with, rheumatoid arthritis. As Hsps 
are highly conserved and immunogenic, it is generally anticipated that self Hsps 
might serve as the endogenous targets of the immune response initiated by the 
homologous foreign Hsps. Contrary to this expectation, studies in the rat 
adjuvant arthritis (AA) model have revealed that priming of the self (rat) hsp65 
(Rhsp65)-directed T cells in the Lewis rat leads to protection against AA 
instead of disease induction or aggravation. The arthritis-protective attribute 
of the self hsp65 is also evident following spontaneous priming of the 
anti-Rhsp65 T cells during the natural course of AA. Furthermore, immunization 
of rats with human hsp60, or with Bhsp65 peptides that are crossreactive with 
the corresponding self hsp65 peptides, leads to protection against AA. 
Importantly, high levels of T cell reactivity against self hsp60 in patients 
with juvenile idiopathic arthritis positively correlate with a favorable outcome 
of the disease. Thus, immune response against self hsp65 in autoimmune arthritis 
is protective rather than being pathogenic.
