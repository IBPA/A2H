Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis are important in the elucidation of 
etiopathogenic mechanisms of the disease and for the development of promising 
new therapies. Species specificity of new biological compounds and their mode of 
action preclude safety and efficacy testing in rodent models of disease. 
Nonhuman primates (NHP) can fill this niche and provide the only relevant model. 
Over the last two decades models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were 
developed in the rhesus monkey and the common marmoset. However, NHP are 
higher-order animals and complex sentient beings. So especially in models where 
pain is an intricate part of the disease, analgesia needs to be addressed 
because of ethical considerations. In our model, a morphine-based pain relief 
was used that does not interfere with the normal development of disease allowing 
us to evaluate important mechanistic aspects of the arthritis.
