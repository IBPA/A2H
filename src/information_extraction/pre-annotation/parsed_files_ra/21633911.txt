Human six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate4 (STEAP4), an ortholog of 
mouse tumor necrosis factor-α-induced adipose-related protein (TIARP), plays a 
role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent arthritis models. However, its 
role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still obscure. This study explored such a 
role for STEAP4. The expressions of STEAP4, TNFα, and IL-6 were compared in 
synovia of RA and osteoarthritis patients. STEAP4 induction was examined in 
TNFα-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro. FLS (with/without 
TNFα stimulation) were also analyzed for IL-6 expression after STEAP4 knockdown, 
using siRNA or transfection with STEAP4-plasmid DNA. IL-8, cell proliferation, 
and apoptosis were also evaluated in STEAP4-overexpressing FLS. The expression 
of STEAP4 in joints correlated with TNFα expression, specifically in RA 
synovium. In the cultured FLS, STEAP4 protein expression was augmented by TNFα 
activation, and localized in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. STEAP4 
downregulation by siRNA enhanced the expression of IL-6 mRNA, while STEAP4 
overexpression suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 expression, inhibited cell 
proliferation, and induced apoptosis via caspase-3. The results indicated that 
human STEAP4 is regulated by TNFα in synovium, where it controls IL-6 secretion 
and proliferation of FLS, suggesting that STEAP4 might potentially suppress the 
pathogenesis of TNFα-induced arthritis such as RA.
