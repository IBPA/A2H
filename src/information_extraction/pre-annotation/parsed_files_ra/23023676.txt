The key role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells in tissue 
inflammation, autoimmunity and host defence led to the experimental targeting of 
these molecules in mouse models of diseases as well as in clinical settings. 
Moreover, the demonstration that IL-17 and T(H)17 cells contribute to local and 
systemic aspects of disease pathogenesis, as well as the finding that the 
IL-17-T(H)17 cell pathway is regulated by IL-23, prompted the identification of 
inhibitors. These inhibitors include biotechnology products that target IL-23 as 
well as the leading member of the IL-17 family, IL-17A, and one of its 
receptors, IL-17 receptor A. Several clinical trials of these inhibitors are 
underway, and positive results have been obtained in psoriasis, rheumatoid 
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This Review focuses on the current 
knowledge of the IL-17-T(H)17 cell pathway to better understand the positive as 
well as potential negative consequences of targeting them.
