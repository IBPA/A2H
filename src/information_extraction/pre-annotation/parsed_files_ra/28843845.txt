Bergenin is a unique C-glycoside natural product possessing anti-inflammatory 
and anti-arthritic activity. It is hydrophilic molecule and stable under acidic 
conditions however is unstable at neutral-basic pH conditions. The rate of 
degradation is directly proportional to the increase in pH which might be one of 
the reasons for its low oral bioavailability. Thus, herein our objective was to 
improve its stability using prodrug strategy. Various ester and ether prodrugs 
were synthesized and studied for lipophilicity, chemical stability and enzymatic 
hydrolysis in plasma/esterase. The stability of synthesized prodrugs was 
evaluated in buffers at different pH, in biorelevant media such as SGF, SIF, rat 
plasma and in esterase enzyme. All prodrugs displayed significantly improved 
lipophilicity compared with bergenin, which was in accordance with the criteria 
of drug-like compounds. Acetyl ester 4a2 appeared to be the most promising 
prodrug as it remained stable at gastric/intestinal pH and was completely 
transformed to the parent compound bergenin in plasma as desired for an ideal 
prodrug. The data presented herein, will help in designing stable prodrugs of 
unstable molecules with desired physicochemical properties in structurally 
similar chemotypes.
