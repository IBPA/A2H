Based on the hypothesis that the complex pathological and immunological 
manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the related diseases are under 
the control of multiple gene loci with allelic polymorphism, a recombinant 
congenic mouse strain was prepared between an MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) strain, 
which develops arthritis resembling RA, and a non-arthritic strain 
C3H/HeJ-lpr/lpr (C3H/lpr). In MRL/lpr x (MRL/lpr x C3H/lpr) F1 mice, the mice 
developing severe arthritis were selected based on joint swelling to further 
continue intercrosses, and then an McH-lpr/lpr-RA1 (McH/lpr-RA1) strain was 
established and its histopathological phenotypes of joints and autoimmune traits 
were analyzed. Arthritis in McH/lpr-RA1 mice developed at a higher incidence by 
20 weeks of age, compared with that in the MRL/lpr mice, who had severe 
synovitis (ankle, 60.3%; knee, 65.1%), and also fibrous and fibrocartilaginous 
lesions of articular ligamenta resembling enthesopathy (ankle, 79.4%; knee, 
38.1%), resulting in ankylosis. The lymphoproliferative disorder was less, and 
serum levels of IgG and IgG autoantibodies including anti-dsDNA and rheumatoid 
factor were lower than those of both MRL/lpr and C3H/lpr strains. McH/lpr-RA1 
mice may provide a new insight into the study of RA regarding the common genomic 
spectrum of seronegative RA and enthesopathy.
