Dioscoreae Rhizoma (MDR), the root of Dioscorea tokoro MAKINO, has been used for 
the treatment of arthritis, muscular pain and urinary diseases in oriental 
medicine. The present work evaluates a methanol extract of Dioscoreae Rhizoma 
(MDR). MDR did not show any cytotoxic effect on mouse lung fibroblast cells 
(mLFCs) or human fibroblast-like synovial cells (hFLSCs). However, it 
significantly reduced the proliferation of hFLSCs stimulated by 
interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). MDR 
significantly inhibited the production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta as well as 
down-regulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) in IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-stimulated hFLSCs. MDR also 
effectively reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these cells. 
Taken together, these findings provide evidence that MDR may be a candidate for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
