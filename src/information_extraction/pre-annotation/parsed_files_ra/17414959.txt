PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There have recently been fewer publications describing novel 
cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis. In the present review we focus on cytokines 
not previously implicated in contributing to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
RECENT FINDINGS: The detection of IL-17 and factors that drive the 
differentiation and expansion of ThIL-17 cells, particularly in mouse models, 
clearly place IL-17 as a potential therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis. 
The emergence of other novel cytokines, notably IL-20 and IL-22, is of interest, 
not least by displaying proinflammatory effects particularly on fibroblasts - in 
contrast to their family member IL-10, the most potent anti-inflammatory 
cytokine. IL-32 is also of interest, with proinflammatory effects both on 
myeloid and nonmyeloid cells.
SUMMARY: It is unclear whether the novel cytokines described in the present 
review will influence clinical practise. The involvement of IL-17 in murine 
arthritis may not translate as effectively to human arthritis - the ultimate 
test is a clinical trial in humans. The lack of efficacy of a recent 
anti-MCP-1/CCL-2 trial in rheumatoid arthritis highlights this dilemma. Finally, 
while technological advances including microarray analysis have broadened the 
scope for cytokine detection in rheumatoid arthritis, these methods have yet to 
translate to therapy in the clinic.
