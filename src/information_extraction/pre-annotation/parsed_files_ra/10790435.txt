Receptors for immunoglobulin (Ig)G (FcgammaRs) are important for the 
antibody-mediated effector functions of the immune system. FcgammaRI and 
FcgammaRIII trigger cell activation through a common gamma chain, whereas 
FcgammaRII acts as a negative regulator of antibody production and immune 
complex-triggered activation. Here we describe the in vivo consequences of 
FcgammaR deficiency in a mouse model of human rheumatoid arthritis. FcRgamma 
chain-deficient mice on arthritis-susceptible DBA/1 background were immunized 
with collagen for induction of collagen-induced arthritis. The DBA/1 mice 
lacking FcRgamma chain were protected from collagen-induced arthritis in 
contrast to wild-type mice, although both groups produced similar levels of IgG 
anticollagen antibodies. In comparison, DBA/1 mice lacking FcgammaRII developed 
an augmented IgG anticollagen response and arthritis. These observations suggest 
a crucial role of FcgammaRI and FcgammaRIII in triggering autoimmune arthritis.
