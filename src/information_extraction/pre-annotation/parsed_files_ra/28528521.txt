Systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) encompass a wide spectrum of clinical signs 
as a reflection of their complex physiopathology. A variety of mechanisms 
related with the innate immune system are in the origin of the loss of 
self-tolerance in these diseases, and for most of them, the myeloid leukocytes 
are key actors. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are 
first-line immune effectors located in the interface between innate and adaptive 
immunity. They are crucial in the organization of the local and systemic 
responses to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and determine the 
intensity, orientation, and duration of the local immune response through the 
expression of chemokines, costimulatory or protolerogenic factors. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge about the role of the main myeloid 
populations in the induction and maintenance of systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome 
(PAPS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS), based on the 
data from both mouse preclinical models and patients. According to these data, 
our challenge in the next few years is to better dissect the fine mechanisms 
underlying the pathological role of myeloid cells in these diseases in order to 
define specific cell subsets or proteins that can be potential targets for drug 
development.
