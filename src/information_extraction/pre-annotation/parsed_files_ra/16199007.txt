To analyze the anti-arthritic effects of QFGJS (a pharmaceutical preparation 
from herbs) on rheumatoid arthritis, adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) was 
established in male SD rats, and two administration protocols, i.e., oral 
treatment with different doses of QFGJS on the day of arthritis induction or on 
the day when visible clinical signs of arthritis occurred, were initiated and 
continued until day 30. Treatments with QFGJS using both administration 
protocols significantly suppressed the incidence and severity of arthritis in a 
dose-dependent manner, showing dramatic reduction of paw swelling and ESR 
throughout the disease progression of AIA. Radiological and histopathological 
examinations showed markedly decreased tissue and bone destruction of ankle 
joints in the QFGJS-treated rats. The serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and 
IL-6 were significantly decreased in the QFGJS-treated rats. QFGJS demonstrates 
pronounced anti-arthritic effects on AIA, indicating that this herbal 
preparation would be a potent candidate as a novel botanical drug for further 
investigation.
