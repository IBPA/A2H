OBJECTIVE: A pathogenic role for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)17 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been 
suggested. In previously published work, the therapeutic potentials of GM-CSF 
and IL17 blockade in arthritis have been described. In the present study, the 
simultaneous blockade of both pathways in a mouse model for chronic arthritis 
was investigated to identify whether this double blockade provides a superior 
therapeutic efficacy.
METHODS: A chronic relapsing arthritis was induced in C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) and 
C57Bl/6 genetically deficient for IL17 receptor (IL17R knockout (KO)) mice by 
intra-articular injection of Streptococcal cell wall (SCW) fragments into knees 
on days 0, 7, 14 and 21. Treatments (intraperitoneal) were given weekly starting 
on day 14. Animals were analysed for inflammation, joint damage and a range of 
inflammatory mediators.
RESULTS: Joint swelling and cartilage damage were significantly reduced in the 
IL17R KO mice and in WT mice receiving anti-GM-CSF neutralising mAb 22E9 
compared to isotype control antibodies. The therapeutic effect was significantly 
more pronounced in mice where IL17 and GM-CSF pathways were inhibited (eg, IL17R 
KO mice treated with 22E9 mAb). Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha blockade had 
essentially no effect.
CONCLUSION: Our data further support the therapeutic potentials of GM-CSF and 
IL17 blockade in a RA model that is no longer responsive to an established 
TNFalpha antagonist, moreover, our results suggest that concomitant inhibition 
of both pathways may provide the basis for a highly effective treatment of 
chronic RA in patients that are resistant to treatment by TNFalpha inhibitors.
