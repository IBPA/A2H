Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the joints 
that can lead to deformities and disability. The prolonged use of conventionally 
used drugs is associated with severe adverse reactions. Therefore, safer and 
less expensive therapeutic products are continually being sought. 
Huo-Luo-Xiao-Ling dan (HLXL), a traditional Chinese herbal mixture, and its 
modified versions possess anti-arthritic activity. In this paper, we examined 
the influence of modified HLXL on two of the key mediators of arthritic 
inflammation and tissue damage, namely, chemokines and matrix-metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model of RA. We treated 
arthritic Lewis rats with HLXL (2.3 g/kg) by daily gavage beginning at the onset 
of AA. The control rats received the vehicle. At the peak phase of AA, rats were 
sacrificed and their draining lymph node cells (LNC) and spleen adherent cells 
(SAC) were tested. The HLXL-treated rats showed a significant reduction in the 
levels of chemokines (RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and GRO/KC), MMPs (MMP 2 and 9), as 
well as cytokines (IL-6 and IL-17) that induce them, compared to the control 
vehicle-treated rats. Thus, HLXL controls arthritis in part by suppressing the 
mediators of immune pathology, and it might offer a promising 
alternative/adjunct treatment for RA.
