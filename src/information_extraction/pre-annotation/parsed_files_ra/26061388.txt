Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor C (RORc, RORγ, or NR1F3) is a 
nuclear receptor that plays a major role in the production of interleukin 
(IL)-17. Considerable efforts have been directed toward the discovery of 
selective RORc inverse agonists as potential treatments of inflammatory diseases 
such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Using the previously reported 
tertiary sulfonamide 1 as a starting point, we engineered structural 
modifications that significantly improved human and rat metabolic stabilities 
while maintaining a potent and highly selective RORc inverse agonist profile. 
The most advanced δ-sultam compound, GNE-3500 (27, 
1-{4-[3-fluoro-4-((3S,6R)-3-methyl-1,1-dioxo-6-phenyl-[1,2]thiazinan-2-ylmethyl)-phenyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-ethanone), 
possessed favorable RORc cellular potency with 75-fold selectivity for RORc over 
other ROR family members and >200-fold selectivity over 25 additional nuclear 
receptors in a cell assay panel. The favorable potency, selectivity, in vitro 
ADME properties, in vivo PK, and dose-dependent inhibition of IL-17 in a PK/PD 
model support the evaluation of 27 in preclinical studies.
