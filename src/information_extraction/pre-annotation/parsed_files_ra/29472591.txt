Periarticular bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered to be mainly 
related to synovial inflammation. However, strong bone loss has also described 
at the time of arthritis onset. Recently, a paradoxical exacerbation of joint 
damage was described when blocking sclerostin in various arthritis models. Thus, 
we aimed to determine kinetics of bone loss and its mechanisms in the adjuvant 
induced arthritis (AIA) rat model of RA. AIA was induced (n = 35) or not 
(n = 35) at day 0. In addition to well-known arthritis at day 12, we showed with 
3D-imaging and histomorphometry that bone microstructural alterations occurred 
early from day 8 post-induction, characterized by cortical porosity and 
trabecular bone loss. Active osteoclastic surfaces were increased from day 8 
with RANKL upregulation. More surprisingly SOST and DKK1 were overexpressed from 
day 6 and followed by a dramatic decrease in bone formation from day 8. At the 
time of arthritis onset, SOST and DKK1 returned to control values, but frizzled 
related protein 1 (SFRP1), proinflammatory cytokines, and MMPs started to 
increase. Bone alterations before arthritis onset reinforce the hypothesis of an 
early bone involvement in arthritis. Kinetics of osteocyte markers expression 
should be considered to refine Wnt inhibitor treatment strategies.
