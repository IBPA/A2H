Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of synovial joints 
that is associated with cartilage and bone destruction. Death Receptor 3 (DR3), 
a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member, has recently been 
associated with the pathogenesis of RA. We demonstrate that absence of DR3 
confers resistance to the development of adverse bone pathology in experimental 
antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). DR3(ko) mice exhibited a reduction in all 
histopathological hallmarks of AIA but, in particular, failed to develop 
subchondral bone erosions and were completely protected from this characteristic 
of AIA. In contrast, TNF-like protein 1A (TL1A), the ligand for DR3, exacerbated 
disease in a dose- and DR3-dependent fashion. Analysis of osteoclast number 
within AIA joint revealed a reduction in areas susceptible to bone erosion in 
DR3(ko) mice, whereas in vitro osteoclastogenesis assays showed that TL1A could 
directly promote osteoclastogenesis in mouse and man. Treatment with 
antagonistic anti-TL1A mAb protected animals in a systemic model of RA disease 
collagen-induced arthritis. We therefore conclude that the DR3-TL1A pathway 
regulates joint destruction in two murine models of arthritis and represents a 
potential novel target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory joint 
disease.
