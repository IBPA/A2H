Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive, highly debilitating disease where early 
diagnosis, enabling rapid clinical intervention, would provide obvious benefits 
to patients, healthcare systems, and society. Novel biomarkers that enable 
noninvasive early diagnosis of the onset and progression of the disease provide 
one route to achieving this goal. Here a metabolic profiling method has been 
applied to investigate disease development in the Tg197 arthritis mouse model. 
Hind limb extract profiling demonstrated clear differences in metabolic 
phenotypes between control (wild type) and Tg197 transgenic mice and highlighted 
raised concentrations of itaconic acid as a potential marker of the disease. 
These changes in itaconic acid concentrations were moderated or indeed reversed 
when the Tg197 mice were treated with the anti-hTNF biologic infliximab (10 
mg/kg twice weekly for 6 weeks). Further in vitro studies on synovial 
fibroblasts obtained from healthy wild-type, arthritic Tg197, and 
infliximab-treated Tg197 transgenic mice confirmed the association of itaconic 
acid with rheumatoid arthritis and disease-moderating drug effects. Preliminary 
indications of the potential value of itaconic acid as a translational biomarker 
were obtained when studies on K4IM human fibroblasts treated with hTNF showed an 
increase in the concentrations of this metabolite.
