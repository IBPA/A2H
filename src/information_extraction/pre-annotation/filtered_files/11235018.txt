OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: A newly synthesized inhibitor of pyrimidine de novo 
biosynthesis, KF20444 (6,7-dihydro-10-fluoro-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-5H-benzo [6,7] 
cyclohepta [1,2-b] quinoline-8-carboxylic acid), was evaluated as an inhibitor 
of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DHase) and tested in the rat 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats, 5 weeks-old, were used for 
evaluation of KF20444 in the CIA model. Arthritis was evaluated by arthritis 
score, serum anti-type II collagen antibody titer, body weight loss, 
radiographical and histological changes.
TREATMENT: KF20444 was orally administered 5 times per week (0.3, 1, 3 
mg/kg/day).
RESULTS: KF20444 inhibited rat liver dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in vitro with 
Ki = 8.5 +/- 3.2 nM, which was a comparable effect to that of brequinar sodium 
(Ki = 25.3 +/- 5.3 nM). The anti-proliferative effect of KF20444 was caused by 
cell cycle arrest at the S-phase. Treatment with 3 mg/kg/day of KF20444 
completely prevented the development of CIA based on reduction of the arthritis 
score. The 50% effective dose (ED50) of KF20444 on arthritis score was 0.64 
mg/kg. KF20444 ameliorated body weight loss associated with disease onset. The 
compound also inhibited the increase in serum anti-type II collagen antibody 
level, and reduced both pannus formation and bone erosion. Importantly, KF20444 
suppressed the development of arthritis, even when it was administered after 
booster immunization of collagen.
CONCLUSIONS: KF20444 is a novel immunosuppressant which inhibits DHO-DHase and 
its effects in CIA suggest that it could be useful in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
