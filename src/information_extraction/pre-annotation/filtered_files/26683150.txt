B-cell depletion therapy has beneficial effects in autoimmune diseases. This is 
only partly explained by an elimination of autoantibodies. How does B-cell 
depletion improve disease? Here, we review preclinical studies showing that B 
cells can propagate autoimmune disorders through cytokine production. We also 
highlight clinical observations indicating the relevance of these B-cell 
functions in human autoimmunity. Abnormalities in B-cell cytokine production 
have been observed in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory 
bowel disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In the first two diseases, 
B-cell depletion erases these abnormalities, and improves disease progression, 
suggesting a causative role for defective B-cell cytokine expression in disease 
pathogenesis. However, in the last two disorders, the pathogenic role of B cells 
and the effect of B-cell depletion on cytokine-producing B cells remain to be 
clarified. A better characterization of cytokine-expressing human B-cell 
subsets, and their modulation by B cell-targeted therapies might help 
understanding both the successes and failures of current B cell-targeted 
approaches. This may even lead to the development of novel strategies to deplete 
or amplify selectively pathogenic or protective subsets, respectively, which 
might be more effective than global depletion of the B-cell compartment.
