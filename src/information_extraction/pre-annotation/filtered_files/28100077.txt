The d-mannuronic acid (M2000) is a novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
that has immunosuppressive effects together with antioxidant property. M2000 has 
shown a notable efficacy in experimental models of multiple sclerosis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and nephrotic syndrome. In this work, the effect of M2000 
on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was performed by Morris water maze 
experiment, and the immunological assessments were carried out by Western blot, 
apoptosis (procaspase-3, Bax/Bcl2, P53), enzymatic (superoxide dismutase [SOD]), 
and nonenzymatic oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA]) tests. We found that 
pretreatment of AD in the rat model by M2000 had a potent efficacy on rat 
behavior and also it led to a significant inhibition of amyloid plaque 
production. Moreover, our data showed that M2000 can reduce the amount of 
Bax/Bcl2, P53, MDA, and SOD, as well as it normalized the level of procaspase-3. 
Our results suggest M2000 is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of 
AD.
