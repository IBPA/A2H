The p38alpha mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is a central signaling 
molecule in many proinflammatory pathways, regulating the cellular response to a 
multitude of external stimuli including heat, ultraviolet radiation, osmotic 
shock, and a variety of cytokines especially interleukin-1beta and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha. Thus, inhibitors of this enzyme are postulated to have 
significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn's disease, as well as other diseases where 
aberrant cytokine signaling is the driver of disease. In this communication, we 
describe a novel class of 7-alkyl-1,5-bis-aryl-pyrazolopyridinone-based p38alpha 
inhibitors. In particular, compound 3f is highly potent in the enzyme and 
cell-based assays, selective in an Ambit kinase screen, and efficacious (ED(50) 
< or = 0.01 mg/kg) in the rat collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model.
