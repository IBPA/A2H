OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT) inhibitor on macrophage inflammatory processes and in 
vivo in rat adjuvant arthritis.
METHODS: GARFT inhibitors, LY309886 (6S-2',5'-thienyl-5, 
10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid) and LY329201 
(R)-N-[[5-[2-(2-amino-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl]-2-thienyl]carbonyl]-L-glutamatic 
acid disodium salt, were investigated in vitro and ex vivo on primary murine 
peritoneal macrophages and in the RAW macrophage cell line for both purine 
depletion and inhibition of LPS induced monokine secretion. In vivo efficacy 
following GARFT inhibition was evaluated in modified rat adjuvant arthritis.
RESULTS: LY309886 inhibited purine biosynthesis in the RAW cell line with an 
EC50 of 90 nM, an effect readily reversible with exogenous hypoxanthine. 
LY309886 and LY329201 also inhibited LPS induced TNF alpha and MIP1 alpha in 
these cells and in primary macrophages. A similar effect could be demonstrated 
ex vivo with mice dosed for two days with 3 mg/kg of LY329201. LY329201 as well 
as methotrexate demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in both paw and spleen 
weight and improved joint histology following 2 weeks of dosing in a rat 
adjuvant arthritis study.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GARFT inhibitors should be tested in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by considering their mechanism of action, here 
successfully tested on activated macrophages.
