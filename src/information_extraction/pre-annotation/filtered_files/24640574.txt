The incidence and severity of rheumatoid arthritis decline during pregnancy. 
However, the role of hormones of pregnancy, including estrogens and relaxin, in 
attenuating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, including joint inflammation 
and bone destruction is unknown. In rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, a model for 
rheumatoid arthritis, relaxin in combination with estrogens, reduced joint 
inflammation and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory, tumor necrosis factor 
alpha. In addition, relaxin together with estrogens, altered systemic levels of 
bone remodeling markers receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B, its ligand 
and osteoprotegerin to improve bone health when compared with arthritic 
controls. In vitro studies using primary rat osteoblasts and an osteoblast cell 
line showed a similar bon-saving response to treatment with estrogens in 
combination with relaxin.
