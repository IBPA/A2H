OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) by promoting chronic inflammation and joint damage. NF-kappaB is a 
transcriptional activator of genes for these cytokines. It also plays an 
important role in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation which plays a key 
role in joint destruction in RA. Ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR) -gamma have recently been reported to inhibit the development of 
RA. In this study, we investigated the role of PPARalpha in RA.
METHODS: We analyzed the protein expression of PPAR-alpha and -gamma in 
rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts (RSF) from RA patients and analyzed the effects 
of ligands for PPAR-alpha and -gamma on cytokine production from RSF NF-kappaB 
activations in RSF and osteoclast differentiation from osteocalst progenitor in 
the peripheral blood. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of oral administration 
of PPAR-alpha and -gamma ligands on the development of adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AIA) in female Lewis rats.
RESULTS: We confirmed the expression of PPAR-alpha in RSF and also demonstrated 
that fenofibrate, a ligand for PPAR-alpha, inhibited cytokine production from 
RSF, NF- kappaB activation in RSF, and osteoclast differentiation from 
osteoclast progenitor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that fenofibrate 
inhibits the development of arthritis in a rat model of human RA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that fenofibrate suppresses the development 
of arthritis by inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling; therefore, this compound 
offers possible anti-rheumatic drug.
