The pineal neurohormone melatonin (MLT) has been widely shown to exert an 
immunostimulatory and antiapoptotic role, mainly by acting on Th cells and on T 
and B cell precursors, respectively. Thus, MLT might favor or promote autoimmune 
diseases by acting directly on immature and mature immunocompetent cells. In 
fact, preclinical and clinical evidence point to a disease-promoting role of MLT 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MLT, whose concentration is increased in serum 
from RA patients, may act systemically or locally in the inflamed joints. The 
circadian secretion of MLT with a peak level during the night hours might be 
strictly correlated with the peculiar daily rhythmicity of the RA symptoms. In 
rat studies employing Freund's complete mycobacterial adjuvant (FCA) as a model 
of rheumatoid arthritis, pinealectomized rats turned arthritic and exhibited a 
significantly less pronounced inflammatory response, which was restored to 
normal by a low MLT dose and was aggravated by a pharmacological MLT dose, that 
augmented the inflammatory and immune response. Continued investigation will 
refine our understanding of these observations, which will possibly translate 
into improved therapeutic approaches.
