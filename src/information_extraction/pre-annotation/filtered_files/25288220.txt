OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to explore the functional significance of the P2X7 
receptor in preclinical models of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Preclinical studies in vivo were performed using the rat streptococcal 
cell wall (SCW) arthritis model. Ex vivo cultures of lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)/benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (BzATP)-stimulated human monocytes 
were generated to test the activities of a novel, highly specific inhibitor of 
human P2X7, AZD9056, on interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 release.
RESULTS: P2X7 receptor expression was detected in inflamed synovial tissue after 
onset of SCW-induced arthritis in rats. Inhibition of P2X7 therein led to 
reduced articular inflammation and erosive progression. No effect was noted on 
acute-phase responses. Ex vivo, AZD9056 inhibited IL-1 and IL-18 release to 
BzATP in LPS-primed human monocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: P2X7 receptor inhibition could represent a novel approach to the 
treatment of inflammatory arthritis. However, confirmatory clinical studies are 
warranted to further explore this possibility.
