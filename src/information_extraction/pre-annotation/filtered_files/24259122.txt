Osteoclasts are responsible for bone and joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis, periodontitis, and osteoporosis. Animal tusk slice assays are 
standard for evaluating the effect of therapeutics on these cells. However, in 
addition to batch-to-batch variability inherent to animal tusks, their use is 
clearly not sustainable. Our objective was to develop and characterize a 
biomimetic calcium phosphate assay based on the use of phase pure hydroxyapatite 
coated as a thin film on the surface of culture plates, to facilitate the 
reproducible quantification of osteoclast resorptive activity. Osteoclasts were 
formed from RAW 264.7 mouse monocyte cell line using a pro-resorptive cytokine 
RANKL (50 ng/mL). No change in substrate appearance was noted after culture with 
media without cells, or undifferentiated monocytes. Only in the presence of 
osteoclasts localized areas of calcium phosphate dissolution were observed. The 
total area resorbed positively correlated with the osteoclast numbers (R(2) = 
0.99). The resorbed area was significantly increased by the addition of RANKL, 
and decreased after application of known inhibitors of osteoclast resorptive 
activity, calcitonin (10 μM), or alendronate (100 μM). Thus, calcium phosphate 
coated substrates allow reliable monitoring of osteoclast resorptive activity 
and offer an alternative to animal tusk slice assays.
