OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To demonstrate the effect of monoclonal antibodies to the 
adhesion-molecule PECAM-1 (CD31) and of prednisolone on leukocyte adhesion in 
rat adjuvant arthritis.
MATERIAL: Adjuvant arthritis was induced in male CD-rats (five groups of n = 6) 
18 days prior to measurements.
TREATMENT: Mouse-monoclonal antibody to rat CD-31 at 200 microg/kg or 
prednisolone at 24 mg/kg were administered i.v. 15 minutes prior to 
measurements.
METHODS: Venules within the intact rat-knee synovium were focused by confocal 
laser scanning microscopy. Numbers of rolling and adherent leukocytes were 
assessed in vivo.
RESULTS: Induction of arthritis significantly increased rolling and adherent 
leukocytes compared to healthy controls. Both monoclonal antibodies to PECAM-1 
and prednisolone significantly reduced adherent, but not rolling leukocytes in 
arthritic animals.
CONCLUSIONS: The method used is well suited for in vivo quantification of 
leukocyte adhesion under the influence of antiadhesive therapies. PECAM-1 might 
be an interesting target for novel therapies in rheumatoid arthritis.
