A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-disease progression (PK/PD/DIS) 
model was developed to characterize the effects of anakinra in collagen-induced 
arthritic (CIA) rats and explore the role of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in 
rheumatoid arthritis. The CIA rats received either vehicle, or anakinra at 100 
mg/kg for about 33 h, 100 mg/kg for about 188 h, or 10 mg/kg for about 188 h by 
subcutaneous infusion. Plasma concentrations of anakinra were assayed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Swelling of rat hind paws was measured. 
Population PK/PD/DIS parameters were computed for the various groups using 
non-linear mixed-effects modeling software (NONMEM® Version VI). The final model 
was assessed using visual predictive checks and nonparameter stratified 
bootstrapping. A two-compartment PK model with two sequential absorption 
processes and linear elimination was used to capture PK profiles of anakinra. A 
transduction-based feedback model incorporating logistic growth rate captured 
disease progression and indirect response model I captured drug effects. The PK 
and paw swelling versus time profiles in CIA rats were fitted well. Anakinra has 
modest effects (I ( max ) = 0.28) on paw edema in CIA rats. The profiles are 
well-described by our PK/PD/DIS model which provides a basis for future 
mechanism-based assessment of anakinra dynamics in rheumatoid arthritis.
