INTRODUCTION: Rituximab (RTX), a chimeric mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal 
antibody, is indicated for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and 
microscopic polyangiitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, but nowadays it is 
increasingly used for the treatment of many other immune-mediated disorders. 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in RTX-treated patients, eventually leading 
to fatal liver failure, has been reported more often among hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients (overt infection) than in HBsAg-negative, 
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) seropositive patients (resolved 
infection).
AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews the safety of RTX in patients with overt or 
resolved HBV infection, providing recommendations for its safe use in such 
patients.
EXPERT OPINION: Prior to starting RTX treatment, all patients should be screened 
for HBV infection. While HBsAg-positive active carriers should receive long-term 
antiviral treatment with entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir, inactive carriers are 
candidates for universal prophylaxis with lamivudine, or ETV or tenofovir in 
selected cases, to prevent hepatitis reactivation. Conversely, for 
HBsAg-negative anti-HBc positive carriers, that is, those with resolved HBV 
infection, universal prophylaxis with lamivudine is recommended for those with 
onco-hematological diseases, whereas watchful monitoring of HBsAg/HBV DNA levels 
is advisable for all the other indications.
