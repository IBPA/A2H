We have addressed the importance of B cell tolerance to collagen type II, a 
matrix protein, which is a target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its mouse 
models. We generated a germline-encoded anti-collagen type II (CII) IgH 
replacement anti-C1 B cell mouse strain (ACB) to investigate how B cell 
tolerance to CII, a matrix protein, is subverted and to further understand 
pathogenesis of RA. Phenotypic analysis revealed that CII-specific B cells were 
surprisingly neither deleted nor anergized. Instead, they were readily detected 
in all lymphoid organs. Spontaneously produced autoantibodies could bind 
directly to cartilage surface without detectable pathology. However, exaggerated 
arthritis was seen after injection of anti-CII Abs specific for other epitopes. 
In addition, Abs from CII-specific hybridomas generated from ACB mice induced 
arthritis. Interestingly, IgH/L chain sequence data in B cell hybridomas 
revealed a lack of somatic mutations in autoreactive B cells. The ACB model 
provides the first possibility, to our knowledge, to study B cell tolerance to a 
matrix protein, and the observations made in the study could not be predicted 
from previous models. B cell-reactive epitopes on CII are largely shared between 
human RA and rodent CII-induced arthritis; this study, therefore, has important 
implications for further understanding of pathological processes in autoimmune 
diseases like RA.
