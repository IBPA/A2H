EBV infection causes mononucleosis and is associated with specific subsets of B 
cell lymphomas. Immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients 
are particularly susceptible to EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease (LPD), 
which can be fatal. Leflunomide (a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis) and 
its active metabolite teriflunomide (used to treat multiple sclerosis) inhibit 
de novo pyrimidine synthesis by targeting the cellular dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase, thereby decreasing T cell proliferation. Leflunomide also 
inhibits the replication of cytomegalovirus and BK virus via both "on target" 
and "off target" mechanisms and is increasingly used to treat these viruses in 
organ transplant recipients. However, whether leflunomide/teriflunomide block 
EBV replication or inhibit EBV-mediated B cell transformation is currently 
unknown. We show that teriflunomide inhibits cellular proliferation, and 
promotes apoptosis, in EBV-transformed B cells in vitro at a clinically relevant 
dose. In addition, teriflunomide prevents the development of EBV-induced 
lymphomas in both a humanized mouse model and a xenograft model. Furthermore, 
teriflunomide inhibits lytic EBV infection in vitro both by preventing the 
initial steps of lytic viral reactivation, and by blocking lytic viral DNA 
replication. Leflunomide/teriflunomide might therefore be clinically useful for 
preventing EBV-induced LPD in patients who have high EBV loads yet require 
continued immunosuppression.
