This study was undertaken to produce the clinical merits of two natural 
antinociceptive anti-inflammatory triterpenoids which synthetic 
anti-inflammatory drugs do not have. The triterpenoid glycoside niga-ichigoside 
F1 (NIF1) and its aglycone 23-hydroxytormentic acid (23-HTA), which were 
isolated from the unripe fruits of Rubus coreanus (Rosaceae), reduced rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) factor and C-reactive protein (CRP) factor in Freund's complete 
adjuvant reagent-induced rats, suggesting that these two triterpenoids had an 
anti-rheumatic effect. It was also shown that treatment with NIF1 or 23-HTA 
reduced gastric lesion extent, acidity and total gastric acid output induced by 
EtOH plus sodium salicylate in a gastric secretion test. Moreover, 23-HTA had a 
greater effect than the glycoside, NIF1. To clarify the anti-gastropathic 
mechanism of these two compounds, their free radical scavenging activities in 
the gastric mucosa were examined in a rat EtOH-sodium salicylate-induced 
gastropathy model. The two compounds significantly increased superoxide 
dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, indicating that the healing 
effects of NIF1 and 23-HTA against gastropathy are associated with free radical 
scavenging enzyme activities. These results support the notion that the 
long-term administration of NIF1 or 23-HTA should overcome the adverse effects 
of synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs.
