The role of T cells in the mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model for 
rheumatoid arthritis is not clarified, and different results have been reported 
concerning the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells. To address this issue, we have 
investigated B10.Q mice deficient for CD4 or CD8. The mice lacking CD4 were 
found to be less susceptible to disease, but not completely resistant, whereas 
the CD8 deficiency had no significant impact on the disease. No difference in 
the development of late occurring relapses was noted. Interestingly, the 
CD4-deficient mice had a severely reduced response to the glycosylated form of 
the immunodominant type II collagen (CII) 256-270 peptide whereas the response 
to the non-glycosylated peptide was not significantly different. Furthermore, 
CD4-deficient mice had lower antibody responses to CII, explaining the lower 
disease susceptibility. In comparison with previously reported results, it is 
apparent that the lack of CD4 molecules has a different impact on CIA if present 
on different genetic backgrounds, findings that could possibly be related to the 
occurrence of different disease pathways of CIA in different mouse strains.
