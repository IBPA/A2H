Mesenchymal TNF signaling is etiopathogenic for inflammatory diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis (SpA). The role of Tnfr1 in arthritis 
has been documented; however, Tnfr2 functions are unknown. Here, we investigate 
the mesenchymal-specific role of Tnfr2 in the TnfΔARE mouse model of SpA in 
arthritis and heart valve stenosis comorbidity by cell-specific, 
Col6a1-cre-driven gene targeting. We find that TNF/Tnfr2 signaling in resident 
synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and valvular interstitial cells (VICs) is detrimental 
for both pathologies, pointing to common cellular mechanisms. In contrast, 
systemic Tnfr2 provides protective signaling, since its complete deletion leads 
to severe deterioration of both pathologies. SFs and VICs lacking Tnfr2 fail to 
acquire pathogenic activated phenotypes and display increased expression of 
antiinflammatory cytokines associated with decreased Akt signaling. Comparative 
RNA sequencing experiments showed that the majority of the deregulated pathways 
in TnfΔARE mesenchymal-origin SFs and VICs, including proliferation, 
inflammation, migration, and disease-specific genes, are regulated by Tnfr2; 
thus, in its absence, they are maintained in a quiescent nonpathogenic state. 
Our data indicate a pleiotropy of Tnfr2 functions, with mesenchymal Tnfr2 
driving cell activation and arthritis/valve stenosis pathogenesis only in the 
presence of systemic Tnfr2, whereas nonmesenchymal Tnfr2 overcomes this 
function, providing protective signals and, thus, containing both pathologies.
