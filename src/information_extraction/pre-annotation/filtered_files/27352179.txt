OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and significance of forkhead/winged 
helix (Foxp3) in rat synovial cells in collagen-induced arthritis rats after 
artesunate interventions.
METHODS: A male Wistar rat model of type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was 
established. The synovia was removed, and synovial cells were cultured for 5-7 
generations. The cells were divided into a normal control group, a CIA model 
group, artesunate groups at different concentrations (5, 10, and 20 ng/mL), and 
a hydroxychloroquine group. The expressions of the Foxp3 gene in the groups were 
detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their protein 
expressions were detected by western blotting.
RESULTS: In the drug intervention and CIA model groups, Foxp3 gene and protein 
expressions increased. The Foxp3 gene and protein expressions in the drug 
intervention groups were higher than those in the CIA model group, and 
fiber-like synovial cells numbers decreased. Foxp3 in the artesunate group was 
expressed at a greater level than the levels expressed in the control groups 
(P<0.05). Significantly increased of expression was observed in the 20 ng/mL 
artesunate group compared with the model group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Artesunate could increase the expression of Foxp3 in a 
dose-dependent manner, and thus reduce pannus formation and erosion of cartilage 
and bone to prevent lesions from rheumatoid arthritis.
