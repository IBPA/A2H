Because there is clinical evidence for an association between periodontal 
disease and rheumatoid arthritis, it is important to develop suitable 
experimental models to explore pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic 
opportunities. The K/BxN serum model of inflammatory arthritis was applied using 
distinct protocols, and modulation of joint disruption afforded by dexamethasone 
and calcitonin was established in comparison to the melanocortin (MC) receptor 
agonist DTrp(8)-γ-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH; DTrp). Wild-type and MC 
receptor type 3 (MC3)-null mice of different ages were also used. There was 
significant association between severity of joint disease, induced with distinct 
protocols and volumes of the arthritogenic K/BxN serum, and periodontal bone 
damage. Therapeutic treatment with 10 μg dexamethasone, 30 ng elcatonin, and 20 
μg DTrp per mouse revealed unique and distinctive pharmacological properties, 
with only DTrp protecting both joint and periodontal tissue. Further analyses in 
nonarthritic animals revealed higher susceptibility to periodontal bone loss in 
Mc3r(-/-) compared with wild-type mice, with significant exacerbation at 14 
weeks of age. These data reveal novel protective properties of endogenous MC3 on 
periodontal status in health and disease and indicate that MC3 activation could 
lead to the development of a new genus of anti-arthritic bone-sparing 
therapeutics.
