Myricetin, a common dietary flavonoid, is widely distributed in fruits and 
vegetables. It is known to be a food supplement contributing to human health 
because of its immune modulatory function, and its antioxidation, antitumor, and 
anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, myricetin was shown to 
directly inhibit cathepsin K activity, a highly potent collagenase, which is the 
predominant papain-like cysteine protease expressed in osteoclasts and synovial 
fibroblasts. It was shown that the IC50 of myricetin for the recombinant human 
cathepsin was 585.3 µmol/L. Also, myricetin proved to have positive effects in 
murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice suffering from CIA received a 
daily dose of myricetin (25 mg/kg, per os). During the study, the clinical 
severity of the CIA and the histopathology were evaluated. Biomarkers related to 
the histological evaluation of cartilage degradation, namely deoxypyridinoline, 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and C-terminal telopeptide degradation 
product of type I collagen (CTX-I), were analyzed. Myricetin treatment reduced 
the levels of biomarkers indicative of cartilage degradation (p < 0.05) and 
ameliorated the symptoms of CIA in mice at the clinical level (p < 0.01). As the 
inhibitory effect of myricetin on cathepsin K activity induced beneficial 
effects on CIA in mice, further investigation of therapeutic interventions with 
myricetin in other mammals or in human rheumatoid arthritis is recommended.
