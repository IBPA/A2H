This study sought to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Polyene 
Phosphatidylcholine (PPC), a clinical drug that is used to treat hepatopathy, on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and on bovine collagen 
II-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. In stimulated primary and Raw264.7 macrophages 
by LPS, PPC significantly down-regulated the relative expression of mRNA such as 
IL-6, TNF-α, TLR-2, TLR-4, MyD88, and NF-κB while up-regulated IL-10 and TGF-β 
expression. Moreover, the concentration of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β in the 
cultured supernatants showed the similar tendency with their mRNA alterations. 
In addition, PPC could significantly inhibit the LPS-induced expression of MyD88 
and NF-κB p65 in both mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that PPC 
could down-regulate the LPS-stimulated inflammation in macrophages through 
TLR-2/TLR-4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in vitro. Furthermore, to explore its effects in 
vivo, PPC was administrated to CIA rats. In comparison to CIA group, PPC-treated 
rats showed decreased arthritis score and osteopenia. Besides, PPC exhibited its 
ability to alleviate the degree of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell 
infiltration, and destruction of cartilage and bone, thus remarkably improving 
the condition of CIA rats. In short, this study demonstrated that PPC had the 
potential to be an anti-inflammatory drug to treat inflammatory disorders such 
as rheumatoid arthritis.
