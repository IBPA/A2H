Aberrant Class I PI3K signaling is a key factor contributing to many 
immunological disorders and cancers. We have identified 4-amino pyrrolotriazine 
as a novel chemotype that selectively inhibits PI3Kδ signaling despite not 
binding to the specificity pocket of PI3Kδ isoform. Structure activity 
relationship (SAR) led to the identification of compound 30 that demonstrated 
efficacy in mouse Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) and collagen induced arthritis 
(CIA) models.
