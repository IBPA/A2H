The ATP-gated P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R) is a promising therapeutic target in 
chronic inflammatory diseases with highly specific antagonists currently under 
clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-inflammatory actions of P2X(7)R 
antagonists are considered to result from inhibition of P2X(7)R-induced release 
of proinflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages. However, P2X(7)Rs are 
also expressed in resting macrophages, suggesting that P2X(7)R may also signal 
via cytokine-independent mechanisms involved in joint disease. In this study, we 
examined P2X(7)R function in resting human lung macrophages and mouse bone 
marrow-derived macrophages and found that ATP induced rapid release of the 
lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B, K, L, and S and that was independent 
of the presence of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-18. Cathepsins 
released into the medium were effective to degrade collagen extracellular 
matrix. ATP-induced cathepsin release was abolished by P2X(7)R antagonists, 
absent from P2X(7)R(-/-) mouse macrophages, and not associated with cell death. 
Our results suggest P2X(7)R activation may play a novel and direct role in 
tissue damage through release of cathepsins independently of its proinflammatory 
actions via IL-1 cytokines.
