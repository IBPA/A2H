Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are serologically and 
clinically distinctive, but at the local level, both diseases have many 
molecular pathways in common. In vivo molecular imaging can unravel the local 
pathologic processes involved in both diseases. In this study, we investigated 
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and cathepsin activity during cartilage 
destruction, in an RA and an OA mouse model, using biophotonic imaging of 
substrate-based probes. Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) or 
destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) were imaged using near-infrared 
fluorescent probes, activated by several cathepsins or MMPs. Fluorescence signal 
intensity was compared to synovial gene expression, histology, and cartilage 
staining of a neoepitope of aggrecan cleaved by MMPs with the amino acids DIPEN. 
Increased cathepsin and MMP activity was seen during CIA, whereas the DMM model 
only showed increased MMP activity. DIPEN expression was seen only during CIA. A 
possible explanation can be differences in gene expressions; MMP3 and -13, known 
to produce DIPEN neoepitopes, were upregulated in the CIA model, whereas MMP12, 
known to be involved in elastin degradation and chemokine inhibition, was 
upregulated in the DMM model. Thus, molecular imaging showed no cathepsin 
activity at the time of cartilage damage in the DMM model, whereas both 
cathepsins and MMPs are active in the CIA model during disease progression.
