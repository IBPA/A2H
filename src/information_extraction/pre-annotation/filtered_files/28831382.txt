Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted 
primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in 
patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male 
treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of 
fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4 days 
before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and 
evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently 
developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew 
gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5 days after 
admission. Later, C. canimorsus was identified from his culture samples using a 
species-specific polymerase chain reaction. C. canimorsus infections should be 
considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts 
following animal bites.
