The pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is ameliorated during pregnancy and 
deteriorated after delivery. Thus, female sex hormones could be involved in the 
pathogenesis of RA. However, the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the 
development and progression of RA have been unclear. In this study, we analyzed 
the effects of female hormones on the pathogenesis of RA by performing 
ovariectomy (OVX) and hormone implantation in the SKG mouse model of human RA. 
OVX mice showed severe arthritis and cartilage destruction with increased serum 
levels of TNF-α and IL-6, when compared with sham-operated mice. In contrast, 
estrogen-treated mice exhibited remarkable suppression of arthritis, with no 
bone erosion, little synovial hyperplasia and little infiltration of immune 
cells. Moreover, serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were decreased. In 
progesterone-treated mice, mild synovial hyperplasia and no immune cell 
infiltration were observed, with decreased serum levels of IL-6. These results 
suggest that female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, can play roles in the 
remission of RA.
