OBJECTIVE: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are 
widely used lipid-lowering agents. In addition to their well-known effect on 
cholesterol levels, statins have been reported to display antiinflammatory 
activities both in vitro and in vivo. In this context, in vivo prophylactic and 
therapeutic effects of simvastatin were recently demonstrated in mouse 
collagen-induced arthritis, a well-described experimental model for human 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to further investigate in 
vivo effects of 3 different statins, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and 
simvastatin, using the same experimental model.
METHODS: Different doses and routes of administration were used for the various 
statins in an attempt to elicit antiarthritic activity in preventive and 
curative treatment protocols.
RESULTS: Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin had no in vivo efficacy, as indicated by 
clinical, histologic (synovial hyperplasia, exudate, and cartilage damage), 
immunologic (anti-type II collagen IgG production), and biochemical 
(interleukin-6, serum amyloid A, and glucocorticoid production) parameters of 
inflammation and autoimmunity. The previously described beneficial effects of 
administration of intraperitoneal simvastatin were reproduced in our 
experiments, but could be accounted for by very severe side effects of the 
treatment, leading to increased glucocorticoid levels.
CONCLUSION: This work shows that different statins have no effect in a murine 
model of arthritis, an unexpected observation given the previously described 
therapeutic effect of statins in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. It is 
still unclear whether statins will have benefit in the treatment of RA.
