The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been implicated neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs) formation which could generate autoantigen. 
Neutrophil contributes to initiate and maintain the inflammatory process in the 
joint. In this study, we show that 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol 
(PLAG) decreases neutrophil migration by regulating the activity of STAT3, a 
regulator of IL-6 and MIP-2 expression. PLAG caused a decrease in IL-6 
production in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in rheumatoid 
arthritis-fibroblast-like synoviocytes via the regulation of STAT3 signaling 
without affecting NF-ÎºB signaling. In a mouse model of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA), arthritic symptoms were recapitulated, with increased IL-6 
level in the synovium, and PLAG treatment restored IL-6 to a level comparable to 
that achieved with commercial therapeutics (such as Remicade or methotrexate). 
Staining of joint tissue with neutrophil-specific antibody showed that PLAG 
significantly reduced the infiltration of neutrophils into the joint synovium of 
CIA mice. The inhibitory effect of PLAG on IL-6/STAT3 or MIP-2 signaling also 
reduced the migration of differentiated neutrophils in vitro. Therefore, PLAG 
inhibits the infiltration of destructive neutrophils into inflammatory sites, 
and can be utilized as a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of sustained 
inflammation and joint destruction.
