OBJECTIVES: Natural medicines derived from plants are drawing more and more 
interest in the prevention and treatment of diseases because of their unique 
characteristics, which include having fewer adverse effects and being more 
suitable for long-term use compared with synthesized chemicals. To explore the 
potentially health-promoting role of genistein, we used a rat model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) induced by a subplantar injection of collagen.
METHODS: In collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) rat model, their 
immunomodulatory activity on rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was 
evaluated. Lymphocyte transformation was evaluated by MTT immunoassay, secretion 
of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and expression of T-bet and GATA-3 by PCR.
RESULTS: The results showed that genistein modulated a Th1-predominant immune 
response because they significantly suppressed the secretion of IFN-gamma and 
augmented the IL-4 production, showed its immune modulation role of keeping the 
Th1/Th2 balance.
CONCLUSION: Accordingly, genistein could play a role in reducing RA-induced 
inflammation and affecting the immune system in powerful ways.
