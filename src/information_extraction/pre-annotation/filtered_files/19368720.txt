Interleukin-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that is critical for T/B-cell 
differentiation and maturation, immunoglobulin secretion, acute-phase protein 
production, and macrophage/monocyte functions. Extensive research into the 
biology of IL-6 has implicated IL-6 in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of 
RA. An anti-murine IL-6 mAb that neutralizes mouse IL-6 activities was tested in 
animal model of collagen-induced arthritis. Prophylactic treatment with 
anti-IL-6 mAb significantly reduced the incidence and severity of arthritis 
compared to control mAb treated mice. The mitogenic response of B and T cells 
isolated from the lymph nodes of anti-IL-6 treated mice was significantly 
reduced compared to cells isolated from control mAb treated mice. The overall 
histopathology score for paws from the anti-IL-6 treated mice was significantly 
reduced when compared to paws from mice treated with control mAb, including both 
inflammatory (synovitis and pannus) and erosive (erosions and architecture) 
parameters. Reduced loss of cartilage matrix components was also observed in the 
anti-IL-6 treated mice. Collectively, these data suggest that IL-6 plays a major 
role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, and thus support the 
potential benefit of anti-IL-6 mAb treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
