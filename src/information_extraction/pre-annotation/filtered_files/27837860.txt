We describe a method for the targeted analysis of bioactive arachidonic acid 
metabolites through cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway in knee 
joint, liver, kidney, spleen and heart using an ultra-fast liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass (UFLC-MS/MS) method. Method validation was 
investigated, including linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, 
extraction recovery and stability for the simultaneous analysis of 
prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), leukotrienes (LTs) and 
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). The method enables us to 
chromatographically separate branched-chain species from their straight-chain 
isomers as well as separate biologically important eicosanoids. The 
concentrations of the following major eicosanoids were significantly increased 
in rheumatoid arthritis model rats than in normal ones: 5-HETE, 8-HETE, 12-HETE, 
15-HETE, PGF2Î±, TXB2, 5-HpETE, LTE4, PGE2, PGD2, LTB4. Further multivariate data 
analysis (partial least square-discriminant analysis) showed COX products (PGs, 
TXs) were readily distributed towards liver and kidney, LOX products (LTs, 
HETEs) towards knee joint and spleen, and heart had no characteristic 
metabolites. The method described here offers a useful tool for the evaluation 
of complex regulatory eicosanoids responses in RA disease states and provides 
support for use of dual inhibitors of COX and LOX enzymes on RA treatment.
