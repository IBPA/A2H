Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) is the most studied animal model for rheumatoid 
arthritis and is associated with the MHC class II molecule Aq. T-cell 
recognition of a peptide from type II collagen, CII256-270, bound to Aq is a 
requirement for development of CIA. Lysine 264 is the major T-cell recognition 
site of CII256-270 and CIA is in particular associated with recognition of 
lysine 264 after posttranslational hydroxylation and subsequent attachment of a 
beta-D-galactopyranosyl moiety. In this paper we have studied the structural 
requirements of collagenous glycopeptides required for T-cell stimulation, as an 
extension of earlier studies of the recognition of the galactose moiety. 
Synthesis and evaluation of alanine substituted glycopeptides revealed that 
there are T-cells that only recognise the galactosylated hydroxylysine 264, and 
no other amino acid side chains in the peptide. Other T-cells also require 
glutamic acid 266 as a T-cell contact point. Introduction of a methylene ether 
isostere instead of the amide bond between residues 260 and 261 allowed weaker 
recognition by some, but not all, of the T-cells. Altogether, these results 
allowed us to propose a model for glycopeptide recognition by the T-cells, where 
recognition from one or the other side of the galactose moiety could explain the 
different binding patterns of the T-cells.
