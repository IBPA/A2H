BACKGROUND: JobelynÂ® (JB) is an African sorghum-based food supplement claimed to 
be efficacious for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although in vitro 
studies confirmed its anti-inflammatory property, no study had shown the effect 
of JB using in vivo animal models of inflammation. Thus, its effects on acute 
and chronic inflammation in rats were evaluated in this study. Its effect on rat 
red blood cell (RBC) lysis was also assessed.
METHODS: Acute inflammation was induced with intraplanter injection of 
carrageenan and increase in rat paw volume was measured using plethysmometer. 
The volume of fluid exudates, number of leukocytes, concentrations of 
malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) in the fluid were measured on day 5 
after induction of chronic inflammation with carrageenan in the granuloma air 
pouch model. RBC lysis induced by hypotonic medium as determined by release of 
hemoglobin was measured spectrophotometerically.
RESULTS: JB (50-200 mg/kg) given orally produced a significant inhibition of 
acute inflammation induced by carrageenan in rats. It reduced the volume and 
number of leukocytes in inflammatory fluid in the granuloma air pouch model of 
chronic inflammation. It further decreased the levels of MDA in the fluid 
suggesting antioxidant property. JB elevated the concentrations of GSH in 
inflammatory exudates indicating free radical scavenging activity. It also 
significantly inhibited RBC lysis caused by hypotonic medium, suggesting 
membrane-stabilizing property.
CONCLUSIONS: JB has in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, which may be related to 
its antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing properties, supporting its use for the 
treatment of arthritic disorder.
