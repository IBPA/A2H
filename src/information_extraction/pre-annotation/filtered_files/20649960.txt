INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease 
primarily involving the synovium. Evidence in recent years has suggested that 
the bone marrow (BM) may be involved, and may even be the initiating site of the 
disease. Abnormalities in haemopoietic stem cells' (HSC) survival, proliferation 
and aging have been described in patients affected by RA and ascribed to 
abnormal support by the BM microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and 
their progeny constitute important components of the BM niche. In this study we 
test the hypothesis that the onset of inflammatory arthritis is associated with 
altered self-renewal and differentiation of bone marrow MSC, which alters the 
composition of the BM microenvironment.
METHODS: We have used Balb/C Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist knock-out mice, 
which spontaneously develop RA-like disease in 100% of mice by 20 weeks of age 
to determine the number of mesenchymal progenitors and their differentiated 
progeny before, at the start and with progression of the disease.
RESULTS: We showed a decrease in the number of mesenchymal progenitors with 
adipogenic potential and decreased bone marrow adipogenesis before disease 
onset. This is associated with a decrease in osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, at 
the onset of disease a significant increase in all mesenchymal progenitors is 
observed together with a block in their differentiation to osteoblasts. This is 
associated with accelerated bone loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes occur in the BM niche with the establishment 
and progression of RA-like disease. Those changes may be responsible for aspects 
of the disease, including the advance of osteoporosis. An understanding of the 
molecular mechanisms leading to those changes may lead to new strategies for 
therapeutic intervention.
