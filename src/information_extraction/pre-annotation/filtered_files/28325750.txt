With the clinical success of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade in treating malignancies, 
there is tremendous interest in finding new ways to augment antitumor responses 
by targeting other inhibitory molecules. In this review, we describe one such 
molecule. B7-H4, a member of the B7 family of immunoregulatory proteins, 
inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production through ligation of an 
unknown receptor expressed by activated T cells. Notably, B7-H4 protein 
expression is observed in a high proportion of patients' tumors across a wide 
variety of malignancies. This high expression by tumors in combination with its 
low or absent protein expression in normal tissues makes B7-H4 an attractive 
immunotherapeutic target. Preclinical investigation into B7-H4-specific chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, antibody-mediated blockade of B7-H4, and 
anti-B7-H4 drug conjugates has shown antitumor efficacy in mouse models. The 
first clinical trials have been completed to assess the safety and efficacy of a 
B7-H4 fusion protein in ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis. Clin Cancer Res;
