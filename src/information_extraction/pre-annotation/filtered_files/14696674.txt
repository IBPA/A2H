Qing-Luo-Yin (QLY), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis, is a combination of the extracts of Sophora flavescens 
Ait., Phellodendron amurense Rupr., Sinomenium acutum Rehd. et Wils. and 
Dioscorea hypoglauca Palib. The suppressive effect of QLY on the development of 
angiogenesis was investigated in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). QLY (0.3 g/kg) was orally administered daily for 27 days. 
Neo-angiogenesis, pannus and cartilage damage, the expression of 
metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) and the level of the tissue 
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in the synovium were examined by 
histology, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemiscal assays, respectively. 
It was observed that the articular morphological alterations, the 
over-expression of MMP-3 mRNA and the reduced production of TIMP-1 in CIA rats 
were significantly ameliorated by QLY. QLY performed about as effectively as 
tripterygium glycosidorum tablets (0.1 g/kg) extracted from Tripterygium 
wilfordii Hook. f.. These results indicate that QLY exerts a suppressive effect 
on the angiogenesis of CIA rats, and suggest that the therapeutic effect of QLY 
could be due to restoring the balance of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in rheumatoid 
synovium.
