SCOPE: This study shows the effect of bovine milk derived extracellular vesicles 
(BMEVs) on spontaneous polyarthritis in IL-1Ra-deficient mice and 
collagen-induced arthritis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: BMEVs were isolated from semi-skimmed milk by 
ultracentrifugation and the particle size was around 100 nm by dynamic light 
scattering and electron microscopy. BMEVs expressed exosome marker CD63, 
immunoregulatory microRNA's (miR-30a, -223, -92a), and milk-specific beta-casein 
and beta-lactoglobulin mRNA. In vitro, PKH-67-labeled BMEVs were taken up by 
RAW264.7, splenocytes, and intestinal cells as determined by flow cytometry and 
confocal microscopy. IL-1Ra(-/-) mice received BMEVs by daily oral gavage 
starting at wk 5 till 15 after birth and collagen-induced arthritis mice via 
their drinking water starting 1 wk before immunization till day 40. 
Macroscopically, BMEV treatment delayed the onset of arthritis and histology 
showed diminished cartilage pathology and bone marrow inflammation in both 
models. BMEV treatment also reduced the serum levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 and their 
production by splenic cells. BMEV treatment diminished the anticollagen IgG2a 
levels, which was accompanied by reduced splenic Th1 (Tbet) and Th17 (RORÎ³T) 
mRNA.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report that oral delivery of BMEVs ameliorates 
experimental arthritis and this warrants further research to determine whether 
this beneficial effect can be seen in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
