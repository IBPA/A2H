A number of polymorphisms in immune-regulatory genes have been identified as 
risk factors for the development of autoimmune disease. PTPN22 (that encodes a 
tyrosine phosphatase) has been associated with the development of several 
autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus. PTPN22 regulates the activity and effector 
functions of multiple important immune cell types, including lymphocytes, 
granulocytes and myeloid cells. In this review, we describe the role of PTPN22 
in regulating T-cell activation and effector responses. We discuss progress in 
our understanding of the impact of PTPN22 in autoimmune disease in humans and 
mouse models, as well as recent evidence suggesting that genetic manipulation of 
PTPN22 expression might enhance the efficacy of anti-tumour T-cell responses.
