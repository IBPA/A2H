Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive 
cartilage and bone destruction. Activated macrophages that overexpress folic 
acid (FA) receptors play an important role in RA, due to their abundance in 
inflamed synovial membrane and joints. In an effort to deliver drugs to the 
inflamed tissues, multifunctional FA receptor-targeting and pH-responsive 
nanocarriers were developed. They were composed of lipids, polyethylene glycol 
(PEG)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) forming a hydrophilic shell, FA 
around the hydrophilic shell as a targeting ligand, and 
poly(cyclohexane-1,4-diylacetone dimethylene ketal) (PCADK) and PLGA as a 
hydrophobic core. PCADK also acts as a pH-responsive material. Methotrexate 
(Mtx) was encapsulated in the nanoparticles, which exhibited pH-responsive 
release in vitro. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity experiments revealed that 
FA-PEG-PLGA/PCADK-lipid nanoparticles loaded with Mtx (FA-PPLNPs) exhibited 
superior cellular uptake and higher cytotoxicity to activated macrophages than 
PPLNPs/Mtx. The therapeutic effect of FA-PPLNPs/Mtx in RA was confirmed in an 
adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model. These results suggest that the 
multifunctional folate receptor-targeting and pH-responsive nanocarriers are 
promising for the treatment of RA.
