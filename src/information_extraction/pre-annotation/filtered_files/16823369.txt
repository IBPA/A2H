Conventional anti-inflammatory strategies induce multiple side effects, 
highlighting the need for novel targeted therapies. Here we show that knockdown 
of the basic-region leucine zipper protein, c-Jun, by a catalytic DNA molecule, 
Dz13, suppresses vascular permeability and transendothelial emigration of 
leukocytes in murine models of vascular permeability, inflammation, acute 
inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with Dz13 reduced vascular 
permeability due to cutaneous anaphylactic challenge or VEGF administration in 
mice. Dz13 also abrogated monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion in vitro and 
abolished leukocyte rolling, adhesion and extravasation in a rat model of 
inflammation. Dz13 suppressed neutrophil infiltration in the lungs of mice 
challenged with endotoxin, a model of acute inflammation. Finally, Dz13 reduced 
joint swelling, inflammatory cell infiltration and bone erosion in a mouse model 
of rheumatoid arthritis. Mechanistic studies showed that Dz13 blocks 
cytokine-inducible endothelial c-Jun, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and VE-cadherin 
expression but has no effect on JAM-1, PECAM-1, p-JNK-1 or c-Fos. These findings 
implicate c-Jun as a useful target for anti-inflammatory therapies.
