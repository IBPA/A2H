Oral administration of the MeOH extract of Rhus verniciflua or of an EtOAc 
fraction containing an EtOAc-soluble portion of the MeOH extract slightly 
decreased rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) factors in 
Freund's complete adjuvant reagent FCA-treated rats, indicating that they are 
active extracts for rheumatoid arthritis, the EtOAc extract being more active. 
Treatment with these two extracts prevented histological changes such as 
synovial cell proliferation, inflammatory cell infiltration and fat necrosis 
compared with an FCA-treated group. Oral administration (30 mg/kg) of sulfuretin 
and fustin, which were isolated from the EtOAc extract by activity-guided 
separation, significantly decreased RA and CRP factors, the former being more 
active than the latter. Treatment with the EtOAc fraction ( p. o.) containing 
sulfuretin significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, and highly 
increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione 
peroxidase. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase in FCA-treated 
rats was also evident. Since treatment with sulfuretin and the EtOAc extract 
decreased the concentration of infiltrated mast cells in the rat knee exhibiting 
rheumatoid arthritis, we suggest that the Rhus verniciflua extract, which 
contains sulfuretin as an active component, may prevent rheumatoid syndromes by 
inhibiting reactive oxygen species.
