To examine the effect of koumine, a Gelsemium alkaloid, on two experimental 
models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) 
and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were administered koumine (0.6, 3, or 15 
mg/kg/day) or vehicle through gastric gavage (i.g.). Clinical evaluation was 
performed via measurements of hind paw volume, arthritis index (AI) score, 
mechanical withdrawal threshold, organ weight, and by radiographic and 
histological examinations. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α, and antitype II collagen (CII) antibody were also examined. In rats 
with AIA, koumine reduced the AI score and mechanical allodynia of the injected 
hind paw in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited increase in 
thymus and liver weights. In rats with CIA, koumine inhibited increase in hind 
paw volume, AI score, and mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner and 
reduced joint space narrowing. Furthermore, koumine also attenuated the increase 
in the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as the robust increase of serum 
anti-CII antibodies in response to immunization. These results suggested that 
koumine effectively attenuated arthritis progression in two rat models of RA and 
that this therapeutic effect may be associated with its immunoregulatory action.
