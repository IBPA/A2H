Autoreactivity is controlled at various steps by numerous mechanisms and is a 
key to understanding and treating autoimmune disease. Recently, an antibody 
against deiminated fibrinogen (DI-FBG) was detected in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) with high specificity and sensitivity. DI-FBG converted 
enzymically by peptidyl arginine deiminase, was also detected in synovial 
membrane. In the present study, we investigated whether antibody to DI-FBG is 
produced in mice immunized with DI-FBG. Mice were immunized with DI-FBG in the 
presence or absence of adjuvant. Production of the specific antibody was only 
induced with adjuvant. The resulting antibody was specific for DI-FBG and did 
not react with intact/native fibrinogen. Furthermore, it recognized deiminated 
human fibrinogen and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP). These results suggested 
that mouse fibrinogen acquires antigenicity in mice through deimination and 
therefore, autoantibody such as that detected in RA patients specifically may be 
induced.
