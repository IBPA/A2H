Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease primarily 
involving inflammation of the joints. Although the management of the disease has 
advanced significantly in the past three decades, there is still no cure for RA. 
The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of 
δ-tocotrienol, in the rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Arthritis 
was induced by intradermal injection of collagen type II emulsified in complete 
Freund's adjuvant. CIA rats were orally treated with δ-tocotrienol (10 mg/kg) or 
glucosamine hydrochloride (300 mg/kg) from day 25 to 50. Efficacy was assessed 
based on the ability to reduce paw edema, histopathological changes, suppression 
of collagen-specific T-cells, and a reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) 
levels. It was established that δ-tocotrienol had the most significant impact in 
lowering paw edema when compared to glucosamine treatment. Paw edema changes 
correlated well with histopathological analysis where there was a significant 
reversal of changes in groups treated with δ-tocotrienol. The results suggest 
that δ-tocotrienol is efficient in amelioration of collagen-induced arthritis. 
Vitamin E delta-tocotrienol may be of therapeutic value against rheumatoid 
arthritis.
