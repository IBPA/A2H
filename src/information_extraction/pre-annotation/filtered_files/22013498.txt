Recent studies indicate the chemopreventive role of resveratrol in many animal 
models like ischemia, rheumatoid arthritis, human cancer, and diabetes. The 
present study was designed to investigate the chemopreventive potential of 
resveratrol in rat hepatic injury model by carbon tetrachloride. Male Wistar 
rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride (0.4 g/kg body weight) 
intraperitoneally daily for 8 weeks. Resveratrol (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg body 
weight) was given orally from first day until the last day of experiment. The 
investigation assesses the effect of resveratrol on morphological, oxidative 
status, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and apoptotic analysis in carbon 
tetrachloride-challenged liver tissue. The study indicated that the inflammatory 
cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were profoundly expressed in experimental rats, whereas 
resveratrol decreases the immunopositivity of TNF-α and IL-6 and restored the 
altered architectural structure of challenged hepatic tissue. Resveratrol also 
protects liver cells by suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis.
