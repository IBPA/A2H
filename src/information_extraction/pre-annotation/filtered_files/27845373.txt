Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a severely debilitating chronic autoimmune disease 
that leads to long-term joint damage. Signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3)-targeted small molecules have shown promise as 
therapeutic drugs for treating RA. We previously identified 
(E)-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butenal (BHPB), a tyrosine-fructose Maillard 
reaction product, as a small molecule with potent anti-inflammatory and 
anti-arthritic properties, mediated through the inhibition of STAT3 activation. 
The aim of this study was to develop a novel BHPH derivative with improved 
anti-arthritic properties and drug-likeness. We designed and synthesised 
(E)-2-methoxy-4-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl) prop-1-en-1-yl) phenol (MMPP), a novel 
synthetic BHPB analogue, and investigated its anti-inflammatory and 
anti-arthritic activities in experimentally-induced RA. We showed that MMPP 
strongly inhibited pro-inflammatory responses by inhibiting in vitro STAT3 
activation and its downstream signalling in murine macrophages and human 
synoviocytes from patients with RA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MMPP 
exhibited potent anti-arthritic activity in a collagen antibody-induced 
arthritis (CAIA) mouse model in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that 
MMPP has great potential for use in the treatment of RA.
