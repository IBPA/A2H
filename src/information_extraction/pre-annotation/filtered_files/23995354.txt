A conjugate between prednisolone (PD) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) with glycine 
as a linker was prepared in order to obtain an effective macromolecular prodrug 
against inflammatory disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis. First, PD was 
converted to the N-trityl-glycine ester (Tr-GP), and the glycine ester of PD 
(GP) was obtained by detritylation of Tr-GP. Then, GP and CS were condensed with 
water-soluble carbodiimide to yield CS-GP. The obtained conjugate had a PD 
content of 2.24% (w/w). Conversion characteristics were investigated for GP and 
CS-GP to evaluate their potential as a prodrug. In the stability test of GP, PD 
was released well in the buffer at pH 6-7.4, but degraded rapidly at pH 8 
without sufficient release of PD. As to CS-GP, PD was released more slowly than 
in GP, and the release rate rose with the increase in the medium pH. PD was 
released gradually from CS-GP over 24 h at a physiological pH. The conversion 
profiles of both GP and CS-GP almost followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The 
calculated conversion rate constants supported the gradual and effective release 
from CS-GP. The release rate of PD from GP and CS-GP was accelerated by the 
addition of rat plasma, but the promotion of release from CS-GP was small, 
suggesting that PD should be released gradually from CS-GP in the systemic 
circulation. It was demonstrated from the preliminary pharmacological study 
using rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis that CS-GP had high anti-inflammatory 
potential against arthritis.
