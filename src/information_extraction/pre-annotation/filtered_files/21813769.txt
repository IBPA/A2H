Defective clearance of apoptotic cells has been shown in systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and is postulated to enhance autoimmune responses by 
increasing access to intracellular autoantigens. Until now, research has 
emphasized inherited rather than acquired impairment of apoptotic cell 
engulfment in the pathogenesis of SLE. In this study, we confirm previous 
results that efficient removal of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is bolstered 
in the presence of wild-type mouse serum, through the C3 deposition on the 
apoptotic cell surface. In contrast, sera from three mouse models of SLE, 
Mer(KD), MRL(lpr), and New Zealand Black/WF1 did not support and in fact 
actively inhibited apoptotic cell uptake. IgG autoantibodies were responsible 
for the inhibition, through the blockade of C3 recognition by macrophages. 
Consistent with this, IgG removal reversed the inhibitory activity within 
autoimmune serum, and purified autoimmune IgG blocked both the detection of C3 
on apoptotic cells and C3-dependent efferocytosis. Sera from SLE patients 
demonstrated elevated anti-C3b IgG that blocked detection of C3 on apoptotic 
cells, activity that was not found in healthy controls or patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, nor in mice prior to the onset of autoimmunity. We propose 
that the suppression of apoptotic cell disposal by Abs against deposited C3 may 
contribute to increasing severity and/or exacerbations in SLE.
