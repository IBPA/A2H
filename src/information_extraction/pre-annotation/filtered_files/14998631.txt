OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at investigating the novel use of minocycline 
for cardiac protection during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, as well as its 
mechanism of action.
BACKGROUND: Minocycline is a tetracycline with anti-inflammatory properties, 
which is used clinically for the treatment of diseases such as urethritis and 
rheumatoid arthritis. Experimentally, minocycline has also been shown to be 
neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia and to delay progression 
and improve survival in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: We studied 62 rat intact hearts exposed to I/R and cell cultures of 
neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes.
RESULTS: Minocycline significantly reduced necrotic and apoptotic cell death, 
both in neonatal and adult myocytes, not only when given prior to hypoxia (p < 
0.001), but also at reoxygenation (p < 0.05). Moreover, in the intact heart 
exposed to I/R, in vivo treatment with minocycline promoted hemodynamic recovery 
(p < 0.001) and cell survival, with reduction of infarct size (p < 0.001), 
cardiac release of creatine phosphokinase (p < 0.001), and apoptotic cell death 
(p < 0.001). In regard to its antiapoptotic mechanism of action, minocycline 
significantly reduced the expression level of initiator caspases, increased the 
ratio of XIAP to Smac/DIABLO at both the messenger RNA and protein level, and 
prevented mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (all, p < 0.05). 
These synergistic actions dramatically prevent the post-ischemic induction of 
caspase activity associated with cardiac I/R injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its safety record and multiple novel mechanisms of 
action, minocycline may be a valuable cardioprotective agent to ameliorate 
cardiac dysfunction and cell loss associated with I/R injury.
