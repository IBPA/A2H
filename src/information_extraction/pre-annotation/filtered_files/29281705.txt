Inflammation is a commonly observed immune reaction, and rheumatoid arthritis is 
a particularly severe inflammatory disease. In this study, we used an air pouch 
mouse model to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of Allium hookeri, which 
has both been used as a culinary material and a traditional medicine in 
south-eastern Asia for many years. Allium hookeri suppressed typical symptoms of 
inflammation, such as condensation of the air pouch membrane, and inhibited the 
expression of several inducible proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, 
IL-13, and TNF-α. In order to determine the molecules modulating the 
inflammatory effect of carrageenan treatment, the components in Allium hookeri 
were analyzed by GC-MS, and linoleic acid, which have anti-inflammatory effect, 
was detected. From the results, we concluded that the anti-inflammatory effect 
of Allium hookeri might be attributed to linoleic acid, which could be promising 
candidates for anti-inflammatory drugs that have no adverse effects.
