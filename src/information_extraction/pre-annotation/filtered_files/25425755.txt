Curcumin-diclofenac conjugate as been synthesized by esterification of phenolic 
group of curcumin with the acid moiety of diclofenac, and characterized by mass 
spectrometry, NMR, FTIR, DSC, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction 
analysis. The relative solubility of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate, curcumin and 
diclofenac; stability of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate in intestinal extract; 
permeability study of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate using the everted rat 
intestinal sac method; stability of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate in 
gastrointestinal fluids and in vitro efficacy have been evaluated. In vivo 
bioavailability of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate and curcumin in Sprague-Dawley 
rats, and antiarthritic activity of curcumin-diclofenac conjugate, curcumin and 
diclofenac in modified streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis model in Balb/c 
mice to mimic rheumatoid arthritis in humans have also been studied. In all of 
the above studies, curcumin-diclofenac conjugate exhibited enhanced stability as 
compared to curcumin; its activity was twice that of diclofenac in inhibiting 
thermal protein denaturation taken as a measure of in vitro antiinflammatory 
activity; it enhanced the bioavailability of curcumin by more than five folds, 
and significantly (P<0.01) alleviated the symptoms of arthritis in streptococcal 
cell wall-induced arthritis model as compared to both diclofenac and curcumin.
