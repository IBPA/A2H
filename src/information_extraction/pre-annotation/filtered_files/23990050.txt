The objective of this study was to compare between the effects of mesenchymal 
stem cell (MSC) and betamethasone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Sixty male albino mice were divided equally into 2 models. They are MSC model, 
group 1: saline control group, group 2: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), group 
3: induced arthritis mice that received intravenous injection of MSCs. 
Betamethasone model, group 1: phosphate buffer saline, group 2: CIA, group 3: 
induced arthritis mice that received intraperitoneal injection of betamethasone. 
Mice arthritis models were assessed by clinical paw edema and X-rays, at the 
proper time of sacrefaction, tissues were collected and examined using real-time 
PCR, and synovial tissue was examined for interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor 
Î±, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and matrix metalloproteinase 3. While 
serum levels of rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein were detected by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Also blood erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate was detected. Histopathological, paw edema and PCR results showed 
improvement in the groups that received MSC compared with the diseased group and 
the groups which received betamethasone. MSC significantly enhanced the effect 
of collagen-induced arthritis treatment, which is superior to betamethasone 
treatment, likely through the modulation of the expression of various cytokines.
