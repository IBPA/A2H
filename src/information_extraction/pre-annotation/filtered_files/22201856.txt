Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of joint disease. OA frequently 
affects knees, hips, hands, and the spine. It is characterized by the 
progressive destruction of articular cartilage and subchondral bone accompanied 
by low-grade inflammation that together result in pain and deformity. Recent 
studies have shed light on the nature of OA genetic susceptibility and confirmed 
a number of candidate genes involved in the destruction of the synovium, 
articular cartilage, and subchondral bone in OA pathogenesis. During the 
progression of OA, there are several cellular changes in joints, including an 
increase in the number of activated osteoclasts and macrophages and an 
infiltration of the synovium by activated T-cells and B-cells. Pro-inflammatory 
mediators (e.g. interleukin IL-1, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-18, and Tumor 
necrosis actor-alpha), proteinases (e.g. matrix metalloproteinase 9 and 
cathepsin K), and regulators of cartilage and bone formation (e.g. BMPs) have 
been shown to have important roles in OA progression at the molecular level. 
Studies have suggested that OA shares several common characteristics with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To systematically understand OA, this review 
summarizes OA disease genes, mouse models of human disease experimental mouse 
models, mechanisms of OA pathogenesis, and current OA therapies.
