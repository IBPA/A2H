Type II collagen (CII) is a target for autoreactive T cells in both rheumatoid 
arthritis and the murine model collagen-induced arthritis. The determinant core 
of CII has been identified as CII260-270, and the alteration of this T cell 
epitope by posttranslational modifications is known to be critical for 
development of arthritis in mice. Using CII-specific T cell hybridomas we have 
now shown that the immunodominant T cell epitope in the normal (healthy) human 
and rat joint cartilage is O-glycosylated at the critical T cell receptor 
recognition position 264 with a mono- or di-saccharide attached to a 
hydroxylysine. In contrast, in the arthritic human and rat joint cartilage there 
are both glycosylated and non-glycosylated CII forms. Glycosylated CII from 
normal cartilage could not be recognized by T cells reactive to peptides having 
only lysine or hydroxylysine at position 264, showing that antigen-presenting 
cells could not degrade the O-linked carbohydrate. Thus, the variable forms of 
the glycosylated epitope are determined by the structures present in cartilage, 
and these vary during the disease course. We conclude that the chondrocyte 
determines the structures presented to the immune system and that these 
structures are different in normal versus arthritic states.
