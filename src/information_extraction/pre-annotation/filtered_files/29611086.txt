Resveratrol (RSV), a naturally occurring polyphenol, has been found to have 
potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. Recently, RSV was 
reported as a new potential agent to suppress inflammation of collagen-induced 
arthritis in a mouse model. Nevertheless, the clinical benefits of RSV in the 
management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were not studied. This randomized 
controlled clinical trial aims to shed some light on the therapeutic benefits of 
RSV in the treatment of RA in patients with different stages of the disease 
activity. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 100 RA patients (68 
female, 32 male) were enrolled randomly and divided into two groups, each of 50 
patients: an RSV-treated group that received a daily RSV capsule of 1 g with the 
conventional treatment for 3 months and a control group that just received the 
regular treatment. The clinical and biochemical markers of RA in both groups 
were assessed. It was found that the clinical markers (i.e., the 28-joint count 
for swelling and tenderness) and the disease activity score assessment for 28 
joints were significantly lowered in the RSV-treated group. Moreover, serum 
levels of certain biochemical markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, undercarboxylated osteocalcin, matrix metalloproteinase-3, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-6) were also significantly 
decreased in RSV-treated patients. The current study suggests the addition of 
RSV as an adjuvant to the conventional antirheumatic drugs.
