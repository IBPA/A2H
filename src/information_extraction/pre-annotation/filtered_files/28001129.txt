Quantification of blood oxygen saturation (SO2) in vivo is essential for 
understanding the pathogenesis of diseases in which hypoxia is thought to play a 
role, including inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We describe a low-cost multispectral microscope and 
oximetry technique for calibration-free absolute oximetry of surgically exposed 
blood vessels in vivo. We imaged the vasculature of the dorsal spinal cord in 
healthy rats, and varied inspired oxygen (FiO2) in order to evaluate the 
sensitivity of the imaging system to changes in SO2. The venous SO2 was 
calculated as 67.8  ±  10.4% (average  ±  standard deviation), increasing to 
83.1  ±  11.6% under hyperoxic conditions (100% FiO2) and returning to 
67.4  ±  10.9% for a second normoxic period; the venous SO2 was 50.9  ±  15.5% 
and 29.2  ±  24.6% during subsequent hypoxic states (18% and 15% FiO2 
respectively). We discuss the design and performance of our multispectral 
imaging system, and the future scope for extending this oximetry technique to 
quantification of hypoxia in inflamed tissue.
