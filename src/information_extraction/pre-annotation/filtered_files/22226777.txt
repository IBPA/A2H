We have previously shown that intravenous (i.v.) treatment with sterically 
stabilized nano-liposomes (NSSL) actively remote-loaded with the glucocorticoid 
(GC) methylprednisolone hemisuccinate (NSSL-MPS) or betamethasone hemisuccinate 
(NSSL-BMS) significantly decreased severity of adjuvant arthritis in Lewis rats 
(a model of human rheumatoid arthritis) throughout all disease stages. Here, we 
compared i.v. or subcutaneous (s.c.) weekly treatment with each of the two 
NSSL-GC to weekly or daily treatment with the free drugs or with the TNF-α 
antagonists Infliximab and Etanercept. Therapeutic efficacy and effects on the 
profile of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF-α, and INF-γ) and anti-inflammatory 
(IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines in rat sera and splenocyte tissue culture 
supernatants were compared to those of the liposomal and free drugs. Both s.c. 
and i.v. NSSL-GC suppressed arthritis significantly, compared to higher doses of 
the free drugs or to TNF-α antagonists. NSSL-GC also suppressed the secretion of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, but did not change the levels of TGF- β. The highly 
efficacious anti-inflammatory therapeutic feature of these nano-drugs makes them 
candidates for treatment of human rheumatoid arthritis.
