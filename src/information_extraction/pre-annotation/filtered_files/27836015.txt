BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, and 
inflammatory autoimmune disease which primarily affects the small arthrodial 
joints. The aim of this study was to test whether transplantation of mesenchymal 
stem cells derived from gingival tissue (GMSCs) could ameliorate 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and to explore the role of the FasL/Fas 
pathway in the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: DBA/1 mice with collagen II-induced arthritis were treated with GMSCs 
from the C57BL/6 J mouse, the B6Smn.C3-FasLgld/J mouse (FasL-/- GMSCs), and FasL 
overexpressed FasL-/- GMSCs (FasL TF GMSCs). Inflammation was evaluated by 
measuring clinical score, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and anti-collagen II 
antibody levels, and histological analyses. The levels of CD4+ Th cell subsets 
in spleens and draining lymph nodes were assessed by flow cytometric analysis.
RESULTS: Systemic infusion of GMSCs can significantly reduce the severity of 
experimental arthritis, and resume the balance of Th cell subsets. FasL-/- GMSCs 
failed to induce apoptosis of activated T cells in vitro and in vivo, and 
therefore show no therapeutic effects, whereas FasL TF GMSCs can rescue the 
immunosuppressant effects in the treatment of CIA.
CONCLUSIONS: GMSC-based therapy induces T-cell apoptosis via the FasL/Fas 
pathway and results in immune tolerance and amelioration of the CIA 
inflammation.
