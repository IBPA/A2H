Bone homeostasis is achieved through coordinated activities of bone-forming 
osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. When the balance is skewed in favor 
of osteoclasts due to hormonal or inflammatory issues, pathologic bone loss 
occurs leading to conditions such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
periodontitis. Bortezomib is the first in-class of proteasome inhibitors used as 
an anti-myeloma agent. In the present study, we show that bortezomib directly 
inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-dependent 
osteoclast differentiation of mouse bone marrow macrophages. Bortezomib 
significantly reduced the induction of osteoclast marker genes and proteins 
including nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). The 
intraperitoneal injection of bortezomib reduced ovariectomy-induced 
osteoclastogenesis and protected the mice from bone loss. These data propose 
novel use of bortezomib as a potential anti-resorptive agent.
