BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Store-operated calcium (SOC) channels are thought to 
play a critical role in immune responses, inflammatory diseases and chronic 
pain. The aim of this study was to explore the potential role and mechanisms of 
SOC channels in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The CIA mouse model was used to examine the effects of 
the SOC channel inhibitor YM-58483 on CIA and arthritic pain. Hargreaves' and 
von Frey hair tests were conducted to measure thermal and mechanical 
sensitivities of hind paws. elisa was performed to measure cytokine production, 
and haematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess knee histological 
changes. Western blot analysis was performed to examine protein levels.
KEY RESULTS: Pretreatment with 5 or 10 mg · kg(-1) of YM-58483 reduced the 
incidence of CIA, prevented the development of inflammation and pain 
hypersensitivity and other signs and features of arthritis disease. Similarly, 
treatment with YM-58483 after the onset of CIA: (i) reversed the clinical 
scores; (ii) reduced paw oedema; (iii) attenuated mechanical and thermal 
hypersensitivity; (iv) improved spontaneous motor activity; (v) decreased 
periphery production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α; and (vi) reduced spinal 
activation of ERK and calmodulin-dependent PKII (CaMKIIα).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence that 
inhibition of SOC entry prevents and relieves rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
arthritic pain. These effects are probably mediated by a reduction in cytokine 
levels in the periphery and activation of ERK and CaMKIIα in the spinal cord. 
These results suggest that SOC channels are potential drug targets for the 
treatment of RA.
