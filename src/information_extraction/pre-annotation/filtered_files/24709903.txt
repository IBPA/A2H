BAFF has a critical role in B-cell survival, maturation and function, which 
makes its pathway a prime therapeutic target for various autoimmune diseases, 
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis and Sj√∂gren's 
syndrome. A cell-based assay that measures the functional activity of BAFF is 
required for many high throughput purposes, such as lead target screening and 
BAFF quantification. We report here the development of a sensitive BAFF 
responsive cell line via stable transfection of the BAFFR-TNFR1 hybrid receptor 
into monkey kidney epithelial COS-1 cells. The cellular response to BAFF can be 
detected by measuring the secretion of IL-8. This BAFF bioassay is not only 
reproducible and sensitive, but also responsive to a wide concentration range of 
BAFF stimulation in sera from various species. This cell line is useful in the 
development of sensitive bioassays to measure the levels of bioactive BAFF, 
inhibition of BAFF and neutralizing antibodies against any BAFF pathway-mediated 
therapeutic proteins.
