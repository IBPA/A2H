Abstract The gastrointestinal tract and the microbes colonizing it form a 
complex ecosystem that has various effects on the well-being of the host. In 
addition to acute infections, the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota 
has been suspected to influence the etiopathogenesis of many chronic diseases, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. It has been 
suggested that the bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract is 
genetically determined. Using gas-liquid chromatography of bacterial cellular 
fatty acids we show in this study that modulation of the microbiota by a course 
of antibiotics is followed by regeneration of the murine intestinal flora 
depending on the genotype of the host. The mice used in our study were 
acclimatized to identical living conditions before treatment with ciprofloxacin 
and clindamycin for 1 week via drinking water. Within a few days of finishing 
the antibiotic course, the cellular fatty acid profiles of fecal samples 
resembled those of the pre-course community, showing a considerable indigenous 
recovery potential. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract appeared to be 
genetically regulated since differences in communities between the mouse strains 
were observed. Our results are in harmony with earlier observations, indicating 
that the gut community is not established by chance and that it is influenced by 
host-derived factors.
