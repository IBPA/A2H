A novel series of 4-phenyl-5-pyridyl-1,3-thiazole analogues possessing potent in 
vitro inhibitory activity against p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the 
release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from human monocytic THP-1 
cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide has been identified. Subsequent 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and optimization for absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) profiles led to the 
identification of compounds 7 g and 10b as orally active lead candidates that 
block the in vivo production of proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha). In 
pharmacokinetic studies, compound 10b showed good oral administration in mice 
and demonstrated significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in an 
anti-collagen monoclonal antibody-induced arthritis mouse model (minimum 
effective dose (MED)=30 mg/kg). Further elucidation of this class of compounds 
may provide novel anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-rheumatoid arthritis 
drugs.
