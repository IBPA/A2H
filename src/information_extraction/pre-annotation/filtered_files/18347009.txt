OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple 
sclerosis (MS) affect a relatively large portion of the population, leading to 
severe disability if left untreated. Even though pharmaceutics targeting the 
immune system have revolutionised the therapy of these diseases, there is still 
a need for novel, more effective therapeutic substances. One such substance is 
the new chemical entity 9-chloro-2,3 
dimethyl-6-(N,N-dimthylamino-2-oxoethyl)-6H-indolo [2,3-b] quionoxaline, 
Rabeximod, currently being investigated for efficiency in treatment of human RA. 
In this study we aimed to evaluate Rabeximod as a treatment for autoimmune 
diseases, using animal models.
METHODS: In the present investigation we have evaluated Rabeximod as a treatment 
for autoimmune diseases using mouse models of RA and MS, ie, collagen-induced 
arthritis, collagen antibody induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis.
RESULTS: Rabeximod efficiently prevented arthritis and encephalomyelitis in 
mice. In addition, this effect correlated to the timepoint when cells migrate 
into the joints.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Rabeximod reduces disease severity in animal 
models of autoimmunity and should be considered as a new therapeutic substance 
for MS and RA.
