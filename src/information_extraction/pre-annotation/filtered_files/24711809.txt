Bidirectional interactions between the immune and the nervous systems are of 
considerable interest both for deciphering their functioning and for designing 
novel therapeutic strategies. The past decade has brought a burst of insights 
into the molecular mechanisms involved in neuroimmune communications mediated by 
dopamine. Studies of dendritic cells (DCs) revealed that they express the whole 
machinery to synthesize and store dopamine, which may act in an autocrine manner 
to stimulate dopamine receptors (DARs). Depending on specific DARs stimulated on 
DCs and T cells, dopamine may differentially favor CD4(+) T cell differentiation 
into Th1 or Th17 inflammatory cells. Regulatory T cells can also release high 
amounts of dopamine that acts in an autocrine DAR-mediated manner to inhibit 
their suppressive activity. These dopaminergic regulations could represent a 
driving force during autoimmunity. Indeed, dopamine levels are altered in the 
brain of mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and lupus, and in inflamed 
tissues of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases or rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). The distorted expression of DARs in peripheral lymphocytes of lupus and MS 
patients also supports the importance of dopaminergic regulations in 
autoimmunity. Moreover, dopamine analogs had beneficial therapeutic effects in 
animal models, and in patients with lupus or RA. We propose models that may 
underlie key roles of dopamine and its receptors in autoimmune diseases.
