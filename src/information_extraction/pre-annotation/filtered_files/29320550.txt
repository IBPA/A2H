INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) 
is a debilitating condition with poor survival prognosis. High resolution 
computed tomography (CT) is a common clinical tool to diagnose RA-ILD, and is 
increasingly being adopted in pre-clinical studies. However, murine models 
recapitulating RA-ILD are lacking, and CT outcomes for inflammatory lung disease 
have yet to be formally validated. To address this, we validate μCT outcomes for 
ILD in the tumor necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model of RA.
METHODS: Cross sectional μCT was performed on cohorts of male TNF-Tg mice and 
their WT littermates at 3, 4, 5.5 and 12 months of age (n = 4-6). Lung μCT 
outcomes measures were determined by segmentation of the μCT datasets to 
generate Aerated and Tissue volumes. After each scan, lungs were obtained for 
histopathology and 3 sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Automated 
histomorphometry was performed to quantify the tissue area (nuclei, cytoplasm, 
and extracellular matrix) and aerated area (white space) within the tissue 
sections. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the extent 
of association between μCT imaging and histopathology endpoints.
RESULTS: TNF-Tg mice had significantly greater tissue volume, total lung volume 
and mean intensity at all timepoints compared to age matched WT littermates. 
Histomorphometry also demonstrated a significant increase in tissue area at 3, 
4, and 5.5 months of age in TNF-Tg mice. Lung tissue volume was correlated with 
lung tissue area (ρ = 0.81, p<0.0001), and normalize lung aerated volume was 
correlated with normalized lung air area (ρ = 0.73, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: We have validated in vivo μCT as a quantitative biomarker of ILD in 
mice. Further, development of longitudinal measures is critical for dissecting 
pathologic progression of ILD, and μCT is a useful non-invasive method to study 
lung inflammation in the TNF-Tg mouse model.
