TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a death ligand that can induce 
apoptosis in cells expressing its cognate death receptors (DRs). Previously, we 
demonstrated the therapeutic potential of recombinant human TRAIL in 
experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models. However, the mechanisms of how 
DR-mediated apoptosis elicits these actions is not known. Here, we show that 
systemically administering a potent, long-acting PEGylated TRAIL (TRAILPEG) is 
profoundly anti-rheumatic against two complementary experimental RA mouse 
models, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen antibody-induced arthritis 
(CAIA), via targeting IL-17 secreting Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Treg). 
Systemic administration of TRAILPEG after disease onset ameliorated the severity 
of inflammatory arthritis including arthritis indices, paw thickness, cartilage 
damage and neutrophil infiltration in both CIA and CAIA models. Additionally, 
the levels of inflammatory molecules (p-p65, ICAM-1, Cox-2, MMP3, and iNOS), 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17) and accumulation 
of activated macrophages were significantly reduced after the TRAILPEG 
treatment. Importantly, TRAILPEG decreased the number of pro-inflammatory Th17 
cells in inflamed arthritic joints through TRAIL-induced apoptosis while 
increasing anti-inflammatory Treg population in vivo. These results suggest that 
TRAILPEG ameliorates autoimmunity by targeting the Th 17-Tregs axis, making it a 
promising candidate drug for the treatment of RA.
