The film forming gel, adhered to skin surfaces upon application and formed a 
film, has an advantage onto skin to provide protection and continuous drug 
release to the application site. This study aimed to prepare a chitosan-based 
film forming gel containing ketoprofen (CbFG) and to evaluate the CbFG and film 
from CbFG (CbFG-film). CbFG were prepared with chitosan, lactic acid and various 
skin permeation enhancers. The physicochemical characteristics were evaluated by 
texture analysis, viscometry, SEM, DSC, XRD and FT-IR. To identify the mechanism 
of skin permeation, in vitro skin permeation study was conducted with a Franz 
diffusion cell and excised SD-rat and hairless mouse dorsal skin. In vivo 
efficacy assessment in mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced rheumatoid arthritis 
animal model was also conducted. CbFG was successfully prepared and, after 
applying CbFG to the excised rat dorsal skin, the CbFG-film was also formed 
well. The physicochemical characteristics of CbFG and CbFG-film could be 
explained by the grafting of oleic acid onto chitosan in the absence of 
catalysts. In addition, CbFG containing oleic acid had a higher skin permeation 
rate in comparison with any other candidate enhancers. The in vivo efficacy 
study also confirmed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. 
Consequently, we report the successful preparation of chitosan-based film 
forming gel containing ketoprofen with excellent mechanical properties, skin 
permeation and anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.
