TLR-induced innate immunity and inflammation are mediated by signaling cascades 
leading to activation of the MAPK family of Ser/Thr protein kinases, including 
p38 MAPK, which controls cytokine release during innate and adoptive immune 
responses. Failure to terminate such inflammatory reactions may lead to 
detrimental systemic effects, including septic shock and autoimmunity. In this 
study, we provide genetic evidence of a critical and nonredundant role of MAPK 
phosphatase (MKP)-1 in the negative control of MAPK-regulated inflammatory 
reactions in vivo. MKP-1-/- mice are hyperresponsive to low-dose LPS-induced 
toxicity and exhibit significantly increased serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, 
MCP-1, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 levels after systemic administration of LPS. 
Furthermore, absence of MKP-1 increases systemic levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines and exacerbates disease development in a mouse model of rheumatoid 
arthritis. When activated through TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, bone 
marrow-derived MKP-1-/- macrophages exhibit increased cytokine production and 
elevated expression of the differentiation markers B7.2 (CD86) and CD40. 
MKP-1-deficient macrophages also show enhanced constitutive and TLR-induced 
activation of p38 MAPK. Based on these findings, we propose that MKP-1 is an 
essential component of the intracellular homeostasis that controls the threshold 
and magnitude of p38 MAPK activation in macrophages, and inflammatory conditions 
accentuate the significance of this regulatory function.
