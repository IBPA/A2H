The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model is the most commonly studied 
autoimmune model of rheumatoid arthritis. Autoimmune arthritis is induced in 
this model by immunization with an emulsion of complete Freund's adjuvant and 
type II collagen (CII). This protocol describes the steps necessary for 
acquisition, handling and preparation of CII, as well as selection of mouse 
strains, proper immunization technique and evaluation of the arthritis incidence 
and severity. Typically, the first signs of arthritis appear in this model 21-28 
days after immunization, and identification of the arthritic limbs is not 
difficult. Using the protocol described, the investigator should be able to 
reproducibly induce a high incidence of CIA in various strains of genetically 
susceptible mice as well as learn how to critically evaluate the pathology of 
the disease. The total time for the preparation of reagents and the immunization 
of ten mice is about 1.5 h.
