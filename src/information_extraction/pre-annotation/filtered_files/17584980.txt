Especially since the (re-)discovery of T cell subpopulations with specialized 
regulatory activities, mechanisms of anti-inflammatory T cell regulation are 
studied very actively and are expected to lead to the development of novel 
immunotherapeutic approaches, especially in chronic inflammatory diseases. Heat 
shock proteins (Hsp) are possible targets for regulatory T cells due to their 
enhanced expression in inflamed (stressed) tissues and the evidence that Hsp 
induce anti-inflammatory immunoregulatory T cell responses. Initial evidence for 
an immunoregulatory role of Hsp in chronic inflammation was obtained through 
analysis of T cell responses in the rat model of adjuvant arthritis and the 
findings that Hsp immunizations protected against the induction of various forms 
of autoimmune arthritis in rat and mouse models. Since then, immune reactivity 
to Hsp was found to result from inflammation in various disease models and human 
inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes, and 
atherosclerosis. Now, also in the light of a growing interest in T cell 
regulation, it is of interest to further explore the mechanisms through which 
Hsp can be utilized to trigger immunoregulatory pathways, capable of suppressing 
such a wide and diversified spectrum of inflammatory diseases.
