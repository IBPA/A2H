Leukocytes are central regulators of inflammation and the target cells of 
therapies for key diseases, including autoimmune, cardiovascular, and malignant 
disorders. Efficient in vivo delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to immune 
cells could thus enable novel treatment strategies with broad applicability. In 
this report, we develop systemic delivery methods of siRNA encapsulated in lipid 
nanoparticles (LNP) for durable and potent in vivo RNA interference 
(RNAi)-mediated silencing in myeloid cells. This work provides the first 
demonstration of siRNA-mediated silencing in myeloid cell types of nonhuman 
primates (NHPs) and establishes the feasibility of targeting multiple gene 
targets in rodent myeloid cells. The therapeutic potential of these formulations 
was demonstrated using siRNA targeting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) which 
induced substantial attenuation of disease progression comparable to a potent 
antibody treatment in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In summary, we 
demonstrate a broadly applicable and therapeutically relevant platform for 
silencing disease genes in immune cells.
