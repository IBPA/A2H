OBJECTIVE: Glucosamine, a naturally occurring amino monosaccharide has been used 
to treat or prevent osteoarthritis in humans. In this study, we evaluated the 
effect of glucosamine on rat adjuvant arthritis, a model of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adjuvant arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by 
injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) into the right hind paw, and 300 
mg/kg of glucosamine, an extra-dose compared with a regular dose for 
osteoarthritis patients (1.5 g/day, approximately 25 mg/kg), was orally 
administered once a day to the arthritic rats for 22 days.
RESULTS: Glucosamine significantly suppressed the increase in arthritis score (p 
< 0.05) after day 10 of adjuvant injection, and inhibited the swelling of 
FCA-injected right and -uninjected left hind paws (p < 0.01) after day 18. In 
addition, histopathological examination of the arthritic joints revealed that 
glucosamine suppressed synovial hyperplasia, cartilage destruction and 
inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, glucosamine reduced the production 
of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) in plasma (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that glucosamine is able to suppress the 
progression of adjuvant arthritis in rats. Glucosamine may be expected as a 
novel anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
