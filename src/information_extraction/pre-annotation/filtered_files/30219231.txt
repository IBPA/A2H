Necroptosis, a necrotic cell death pathway regulated by receptor interacting 
protein (RIP) 1 and 3, plays a key role in pathophysiological processes, 
including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, whether necroptosis is involved in 
RA articular cartilage damage processes remain unclear. The aim of present study 
was to investigate the dynamic changes in arthritic chondrocyte necroptosis and 
the effect of RIP1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and acid-sensing ion channels 
(ASICs) inhibitor amiloride on arthritic cartilage injury and acid-induced 
chondrocyte necroptosis. Our results demonstrated that the expression of RIP1, 
RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein phosphorylation (p-MLKL) were 
increased in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat articular cartilage in vivo and 
acid-induced chondrocytes in vitro. High co-expression of ASIC1a and RIP1 showed 
in AA rat articular cartilage. Moreover, Nec-1 and amiloride could reduce 
articular cartilage damage and necroinflammation in AA rats. In addition, 
acid-induced increase in necroptosis markers RIP1/RIP3 were inhibited by Nec-1, 
ASIC1a-specific blocker psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx-1) or ASIC1a-short hairpin RNA 
respectively, which revealed that necroptosis is triggered in acid-induced 
chondrocytes and mediated by ASIC1a. These findings indicated that blocking 
ASIC1a-mediated chondrocyte necroptosis may provide potential therapeutic 
strategies for RA treatment.
