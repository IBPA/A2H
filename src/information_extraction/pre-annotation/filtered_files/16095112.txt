OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the utility of 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for anti-angiogenic gene therapy in a mouse 
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: CIA mice were generated by immunization with bovine type-II collagen 
and Freund's complete adjuvant. AAV vectors containing angiostatin and enhanced 
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression units (AAV-Ang/GFP) or the GFP and 
neomycin phosphotransferase (NeoR) expression units (AAV-GFP/NeoR) were injected 
into mouse knee joints before development of arthritis. The expression of 
transgenes was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and immunostaining, and the incidence and severity of arthritis was 
determined histologically via assessment of synovial hyperplasia, cartilage 
erosion and bone erosion. Vascularity in the knee joint was evaluated by 
immunohistochemical staining with anti-von Willebrand factor antibody.
RESULTS: AAV vectors were capable of efficient gene transfer into chondrocytes 
and synovial cells, and the extent of synovial hyperplasia and other parameters 
of arthritis were significantly reduced in the knee joints injected with 
AAV-Ang/GFP compared with the joints treated with either AAV-GFP/NeoR or 
phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). Reduction in the number of vessels was 
confirmed in AAV-Ang/GFP-treated joints.
CONCLUSION: AAV-vector-mediated local expression of angiostatin efficiently 
inhibited the development of collagen-induced arthritis in the treated joint. 
Anti-angiogenic gene therapy using AAV vector may provide a new approach for the 
effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
