BACKGROUND: The interaction of coagulation factors has been shown to go beyond 
their traditional roles in hemostasis and to affect the development of 
inflammatory diseases. Key molecular players, such as fibrinogen, thrombin, or 
factor XII have been mechanistically and epidemiologically linked to 
inflammatory disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
and colitis.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence for a role of coagulation 
factors, especially factor XII, fibrinogen, and thrombin in inflammatory 
disorders like MS, RA, and bowel disorders.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was done in the PubMed database to 
identify studies about coagulation factors in inflammatory diseases. Original 
articles and reviews investigating the role of the kallikrein-kinin and the 
coagulation system in mouse and humans were included.
RESULTS: We identified 43 animal studies dealing with inflammatory disorders and 
factors of the kallikrein-kinin or the coagulation system. Different 
immunological influences are described and novel molecular mechanisms linking 
coagulation and inflammation are reported.
CONCLUSION: A number of studies have highlighted coagulation factors to tip the 
balance between hemostasis and thrombosis and between protection from infection 
and extensive inflammation. To optimize the treatment of chronic inflammatory 
disorders by these factors, further studies are necessary.
