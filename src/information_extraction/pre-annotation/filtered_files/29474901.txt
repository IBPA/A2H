ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huo Luo Xiao Ling Dan (HLXLD), a traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM), is commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).
AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of HLXLD on 
anti-inflammatory activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A metabolomic approach based on UFLC-MS/MS to profile 
arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic changes was used. The cyclooxygenase (COX) and 
lipoxygenase (LOX) catalyzed metabolites in plasma were quantified on 7, 14, 21, 
and 28 days after the rats injected with Complete Freund's adjuvant and orally 
administrated with HLXLD, methotrexate and dexamethasone in parallel as the 
positive control drugs.
RESULTS: Nineteen metabolites involved in COX and LOX pathways in RA model group 
were significant increased compared with normal group (P < 0.05), including 
12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 15-HETE, 8-HETE, leukotriene 
B4(LTB4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGI2, PGD2, PGF2α, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 
etc. From day 7 to day 28, the trajectory direction of HLXLD group and positive 
control groups gradually moved towards the initial space, and the concentrations 
of AA and its metabolites after HLXLD treatment were significantly reduced in 
dual pathways compared to control groups.
CONCLUSION: HLXLD induced a substantial change in the AA metabolic profiles 
through refrain the expression of COX and LOX. The present investigation also 
highlights that distinct ingredients of this formula tend to inhibit different 
target to achieve a therapeutic effect.
