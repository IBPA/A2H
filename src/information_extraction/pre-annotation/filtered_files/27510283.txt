Increased expression of endogenous Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligands (e.g., 
Tenascin-C, S100A8/A9, citrullinated fibrinogen (cFb) immune complexes) has been 
observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their roles in RA 
pathogenesis are not well understood. Here, we investigated the expression 
kinetics and role of endogenous TLR4 ligands in the murine model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Tenascin-C was upregulated in blood early in 
CIA, and correlated positively with the clinical score at day 56. Levels of 
S100A8/A9 increased starting from day 28, peaking at day 42, and correlated 
positively with joint inflammation. Levels of anti-cFb antibodies increased 
during the late phase of CIA and correlated positively with both joint 
inflammation and cartilage damage. Blockade of TLR4 activation at the time of 
the first TLR4 ligand upregulation prevented clinical and histological signs of 
arthritis. A TLR4-dependent role was also observed for Tenascin-C and cFb immune 
complexes in osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our data 
suggests that the pathogenic contribution of TLR4 in promoting joint 
inflammation and bone erosion during CIA occurs via various TLR4 ligands arising 
at different stages of disease. The data also suggests that Blockade of TLR4 
with monoclonal antibodies is a promising strategy in RA treatment.
