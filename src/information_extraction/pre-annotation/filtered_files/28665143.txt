AIMS: Systemic diseases often have common characteristics. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the feasibility of targeting common pathological metabolism 
to inhibit the progression of malignant and proliferative diseases.
RESULTS: Gefitinib-resistant (G-R) nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were studied as conditions representative of malignant 
and proliferative diseases, respectively. Strong lipogenic activity and high 
expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) were found in 
both G-R NSCLC cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients (RASFs). 
Berberine (BBR), an effective suppressor of SREBP1 and lipogenesis regulated 
through reactive oxygen species (ROS)/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the 
growth of G-R NSCLC cells and RASFs but not that of normal cells. It effectively 
caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated ROS/AMPK pathway, and finally 
suppressed cellular lipogenesis and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, 
AMPK inhibitor, and palmitic acid significantly reduced the effect of BBR. In an 
in vivo study, treatment of BBR led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor 
xenograft growth and remarkably slowed down the development of adjuvant-induced 
arthritis in rats. Innovation and Conclusion: Targeting ROS/AMPK/lipogenesis 
signaling pathway selectively inhibited the growth of G-R NSCLC cells and the 
progress of RASFs in vitro and in vivo, which provides a new avenue for treating 
malignancies and proliferative diseases. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 339-357.
