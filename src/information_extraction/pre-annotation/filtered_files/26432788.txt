Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are the two most common joint 
diseases, and they have characterization of synovial inflammation and cartilage 
destruction, associated with the accumulation of numerous catabolic mediators 
and inflammatory cells in the synovial space and surrounding soft tissues. How 
these factors are cleared and if the "clearance" process contributes to 
pathogenesis of arthritis are not known. Recently, we found the existence of the 
peri-articular lymphatic system in mouse joints. The blockade of 
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic draining function accelerates while stimulation 
of lymphatic function attenuates the severity of joint tissue lesions in mouse 
models of RA and OA. More importantly, we noticed the similarity between the 
dysfunction of lymphatic drainage in arthritic joints and "Bi" theory of Chinese 
medicine (CM), and demonstrated that several Bi disease-treated herbal drugs 
directly affect the function of lymphatic endothelial cells. Here we review the 
advances about the interactions between joint inflammation and changes in the 
peri-articular lymphatic system and discuss our view of linking "Bi" theory of 
CM to lymphatic dysfunction in arthritis.
