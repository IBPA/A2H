Patients with metabolic disorders frequently suffer from side effects induced by 
long-term oral medications. The present study using a rat model system indicated 
that leflunomide (LF) and amlodipine (AMD), the active ingredients contained in 
the medications for rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension, respectively, 
appeared to induce various bowel problems including constipation and 
inflammation. In the small and large intestine, LF increased the expression of 
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 compared to the 
null control and AMD increased the expression of both TNF-α and IL-1β, although 
its effect on IL-6 was only increased in the large intestine. It is noteworthy 
that the probiotic blend tested was found to alleviate intestinal complications 
caused by LF and AMD. Analysis of the gut microbiota revealed that AMD induced 
compositional changes in the gut microbiota. Namely, members of the phylum 
Bacteroidetes, which constituted only about 0.3% of the microbiota in the null 
control, made up more than 10% of the total composition in the AMD-administered 
rats. Interestingly, the probiotic blend was also found to normaliSe the gut 
microbiota.
