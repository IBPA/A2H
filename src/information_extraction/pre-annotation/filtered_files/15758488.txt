Animal models of arthritis are used to study pathogenesis of disease and to 
evaluate potential anti-arthritic drugs for clinical use. Therefore 
morphological similarities to human disease and capacity of the model to predict 
efficacy in humans are important criteria in model selection. Animal models of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a proven track record of predictability for 
efficacy in humans include: rat adjuvant arthritis, rat type II collagen 
arthritis, mouse type II collagen arthritis and antigen-induced arthritis in 
several species. Agents currently in clinical use (or trials) that are active in 
these models include: corticosteroids, methotrexate, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclosporin A, leflunomide interleukin-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1ra) and soluble TNF receptors. For some of these agents, the 
models also predict that toxicities seen at higher doses for prolonged dosing 
periods would preclude dosing in humans at levels that might provide disease 
modifying effects. Data, conduct and features of the various models of these 
commonly utilized models of RA as well as some transgenic mouse models and less 
commonly utilized rodent models will be discussed with emphasis on their 
similarities to human disease.
