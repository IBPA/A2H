Liposteroid, a lipid emulsion containing dexamethasone, was developed in Japan. 
This drug is effective against rheumatoid arthritis, and has fewer side effects 
than dexamethasone. Moreover, at high dosage, liposteroid has been effectively 
used for the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome, because the lipid 
emulsions are easily taken up by phagocytes, and are retained in macrophages. 
Its anti-inflammatory effect was found to be 2-5 times higher than that of 
dexamethasone in arthritis and granuloma rat models. Japanese researchers have 
reported the clinical efficacy and utility of liposteroid in the treatment of 
diseases with macrophage activation. These include hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, graft-versus-host disease, and pulmonary hemosiderosis. 
Here, we describe the clinical effects of liposteroid on macrophage activation 
syndrome and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients.
