BACKGROUND: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been known that UDCA has prominent 
effects on liver, however, there is little known about its influence on 
autoimmune disease. Here, the benefit of UDCA on arthritis rheumatoid (RA) in 
vivo was tested.
METHODS: RA mouse were induced using collagen II (CIA, collagen induced 
arthritis) where the disease severity or UDCA-related signaling pathway such as 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or small heterodimer partner interacting 
leucine zipper protein (SMILE) was evaluated by westerblot and 
immunohistochemical staining. Gene expression was measured by 
realtime-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: The administration of UDCA effectively alleviated the arthritic score 
and incidence with decreased cartilage damage and lipid metabolic parameters. 
UDCA also suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It was 
confirmed that UDCA upregulated the expression of SMILE and transcriptional 
activity of PPARγ via controlling AMPK or p38 activity.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the therapeutic effect of UDCA inducing SMILE 
through AMPK activation in rheumatoid arthritis mouse as well as other 
autoimmune disease was proposed.
