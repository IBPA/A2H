Novel series of N-(5-(arylcarbonyl)thiazol-2-yl)amides and 
N-(5-(arylcarbonyl)thiophen-2-yl)amides were discovered as potent retinoic acid 
receptor-related orphan receptor-gamma-t (RORγt) inhibitors. SAR studies of the 
RORγt HTS hit 6a led to identification of thiazole ketone amide 8h and thiophene 
ketone amide 9g with high binding affinity and inhibitory activity of Th17 cell 
differentiation. Compound 8h showed in vivo efficacy in both mouse experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and collagen induced arthritis (CIA) models 
via oral administration.
