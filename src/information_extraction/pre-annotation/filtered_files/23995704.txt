Fingolimod (FTY720) is known to have a significant therapeutic effect in various 
autoimmune disease models. Here, we examined FTY720 in a model of rheumatoid 
arthritis, induced by immunizing DBA/1 mice with a peptide consisting of 
residues 325 through 339 of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI325-339). The 
efficacy was evaluated in terms of macroscopic findings, inflammatory cell 
infiltration and autoantibody level. Prophylactic administration of FTY720 from 
the day of immunization significantly suppressed the development of paw 
swelling, but therapeutic administration of FTY720 from onset of symptoms on day 
8-9 was less effective. Interestingly, however, combination treatment with 
FTY720 plus GPI325-339 for 5â€‰d after onset of symptoms significantly reduced the 
severity of symptoms in all mice, and no relapse occurred after booster 
immunization. Taking into account the reported mechanism of action of FTY720, 
these results indicate that combination treatment with FTY720 plus pathogenic 
autoantigen might efficiently induce immune tolerance by sequestering 
circulating autoantigen-specific lymphocytes from blood and peripheral tissues 
to the secondary lymphoid tissues. Combination treatment with FTY720 plus 
pathogenic autoantigen may become a breakthrough treatment for 
remission-induction in patients with autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid 
arthritis.
