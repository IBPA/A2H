Recent advances of biotechnology have laid the groundwork for potent and 
specific molecular-targeting therapies including RNA interference. The largest 
remaining hurdle for widespread use of this technology in skin is an effective 
delivery system. Here, we demonstrate an effective topical delivery system using 
a cream formulation containing a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically 
targets osteopontin (OPN). OPN is a validated target in numerous inflammatory 
diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The siRNA targeting OPN was 
incorporated into a cream formulation GeneCream that penetrates the stratum 
corneum, depositing siRNA in the epidermis, dermis, and to a lesser extent, 
subcutaneous tissue. In addition, when the OPN siRNA cream was topically applied 
to the skin of a collagen antibody-induced RA mouse model, the siRNA cream 
prevented the occurrence of severe, irreversible damage to bone and cartilage. 
Thus, the siRNA cream provides effective delivery of active OPN siRNA, 
suggesting this formulation may represent a platform technology for delivery of 
siRNAs for treating various disorders including RA.
