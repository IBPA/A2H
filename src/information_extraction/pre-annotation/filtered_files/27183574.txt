Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease of articular joints that leads to 
degeneration of both cartilage and subchondral bone. These degenerative changes 
are further aggravated by proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α. 
Previously, we have reported that IL-3, a cytokine secreted by activated T 
cells, protects cartilage and bone damage in murine models of inflammatory and 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, how IL-3 protects cartilage degeneration is not 
yet known. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-3 on cartilage 
degeneration under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. We found that both 
mouse and human chondrocytes show strong expression of IL-3R at gene and protein 
levels. IL-3 increases the expression of mouse chondrocyte-specific genes, Sox9 
and collagen type IIa, which were downregulated by IL-1β. Moreover, IL-3 
downregulated IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases 
in both mouse and human chondrocytes. Interestingly, IL-3 reduces the 
degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone microarchitecture in a 
mouse model of human OA. Moreover, IL-3 showed the preventive and therapeutic 
effects on cartilage degeneration induced by IL-1β in micromass pellet cultures 
of human mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, to our knowledge, we provide the first 
evidence that IL-3 has therapeutic potential in amelioration of degeneration of 
articular cartilage and subchondral bone microarchitecture associated with OA.
