It has been reported that taxifolin inhibit osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 
cells. In our research, the inhibition effects of taxifolin on the 
osteoclastogenesis of human bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) induced by 
receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) as well as the protection effects in 
lipopolysaccharide-induced bone lysis mouse model have been demonstrated. In 
vitro, taxifolin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of human 
BMMs without cytotoxicity. Moreover, taxifolin significantly suppressed 
RANKL-induced gene expression, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, 
matrix metalloproteinase-9 nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and cathepsin 
K, and F-actin ring formation. Further studies showed that taxifolin inhibit 
osteoclastogenesis via the suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In vivo, 
taxifolin prevented bone loss in mouse calvarial osteolysis model. In 
conclusion, the results suggested that taxifolin has a therapeutic potential for 
osteoclastogenesis-related diseases such as osteoporosis, osteolysis, and 
rheumatoid arthritis.
