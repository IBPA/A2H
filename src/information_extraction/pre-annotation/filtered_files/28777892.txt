OBJECTIVE: The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and type I 
interferons (IFNs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains a subject of 
controversy. This study was undertaken to explore the contribution of PDCs and 
type I IFNs to RA pathogenesis using various animal models of PDC depletion and 
to monitor the effect of localized PDC recruitment and activation on joint 
inflammation and bone damage.
METHODS: Mice with K/BxN serum-induced arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis, 
and human tumor necrosis factor transgene insertion were studied. Symptoms were 
evaluated by visual scoring, quantification of paw swelling, determination of 
cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and histologic analysis. 
Imiquimod-dependent therapeutic effects were monitored by transcriptome analysis 
(using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and flow 
cytometric analysis of the periarticular tissue.
RESULTS: PDC-deficient mice showed exacerbation of inflammatory and arthritis 
symptoms after arthritogenic serum transfer. In contrast, enhancing PDC 
recruitment and activation to arthritic joints by topical application of the 
Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) agonist imiquimod significantly ameliorated 
arthritis in various mouse models. Imiquimod induced an IFN signature and led to 
reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells.
CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effects of imiquimod on joint inflammation and bone 
destruction are dependent on TLR-7 sensing by PDCs and type I IFN signaling. Our 
findings indicate that local recruitment and activation of PDCs represents an 
attractive therapeutic opportunity for RA patients.
