OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered to be a prototypical 
autoimmune disorder. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the known 
pathologic function of B cells in RA, including antigen presentation, cytokine 
secretion, and humoral immunity. The aim of this study was to address the 
function of B lymphocytes in experimental arthritis.
METHODS: We mapped the adaptive immune response following collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). We subsequently monitored these responses and disease outcomes 
in genetically modified mouse strains that lack mature B cell or germinal center 
(GC) functionality in a B cell-intrinsic manner.
RESULTS: Following primary immunization, the draining lymph nodes broadly 
reacted against type II collagen (CII) with the formation of GCs and T cell 
activation. Mice that lacked mature B cell function were fully protected against 
CIA and had a severely attenuated ability to mount isotype-switched humoral 
immune responses against CII. Almost identical results were observed in mice 
that were selectively deficient in GC responses. Importantly, GC-deficient mice 
were fully susceptible to collagen antibody-induced arthritis.
CONCLUSION: We identified GC formation and anticollagen antibody production as 
the key pathogenic functions of B cells in CIA. The role of B cells in RA is 
likely to be more complex. However, targeting the GC reaction could allow for 
therapeutic interventions that are more refined than general B cell depletion.
