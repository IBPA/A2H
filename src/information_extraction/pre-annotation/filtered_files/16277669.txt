Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a drug developed for Wilson's disease, produces an 
anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effect by reducing systemic copper levels. 
TM therapy has proved effective in inhibiting the growth of tumors in animal 
tumor models and in cancer patients. We have hypothesized that TM may be used 
for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and have examined the efficacy of TM on 
adjuvant-induced arthritis in the rat, which is a model of acute inflammatory 
arthritis and inflammatory cachexia. TM delayed the onset of and suppressed the 
severity of clinical arthritis on both paw volume and the arthritis score. 
Histological examination demonstrated that TM significantly reduces the synovial 
hyperplasia and inflammatory cell invasion in joint tissues. Interestingly, TM 
can inhibit the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in serum 
synovial tissues, especially in endothelial cells and macrophages. Moreover, the 
extent of pannus formation, which leads to bone destruction, is correlated with 
the content of vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum. There was no 
mortality in TM-treated rat abnormalities. TM also suppressed inflammatory 
cachexia. We suggest that copper deficiency induced by TM is a potent approach 
both to inhibit the progression of rheumatoid arthritis with minimal adverse 
effects and to improve the well-being of rheumatoid arthritis patients.
