The present study was designed to investigate blood vessel density interpreted 
as an indirect measurement of angiogenesis following 
4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-6-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-diethylamino-pyrimidine 
(TAS-202) treatment in a rat model of arthritis. Male Lewis rats were inoculated 
intradermally with Mycobacterium butyricum into the hind paw and the arthritic 
responses were evaluated by measuring the changes in paw volume. Both peroral 
TAS-202 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) and indomethacin (1 mg/kg/day) inhibited the 
autoimmune phase of the arthritic response. However, while the increase in blood 
vessel density in the synovial tissue was significantly inhibited by TAS-202 (10 
and 30 mg/kg/day), indomethacin did not exert this effect (1 mg/kg/day). These 
results, together with the observation that TAS-202 in combination with 
indomethacin or prednisolone maintained its ability to exert an antiangiogenic 
effect, indicate that TAS-202 may offer promise as an oral pro-drug for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, through its inhibitory effect on angiogenesis 
at the inflammation site.
