The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathology of zymosan-induced 
arthritis in the SKG mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis in humans, and to 
validate this model as a reliable drug screening system. To achieve this 
purpose, methotrexate (1 or 10 mg/kg, once daily) or vehicle only was 
administered intraperitoneally to SKG mice with zymosan-induced arthritis. 
Histologically, this arthritis was characterized by the presence of granulation 
tissue rich in granulocytes. Methotrexate suppressed the development of 
arthritis in ankle and wrist joints in both clinical and histological studies. 
These results indicated that methotrexate has not only prophylactic, but also 
therapeutic effects on zymosan-induced arthritis developed in SKG mice and may 
thus be a promising control agent for drug research in the SKG mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
