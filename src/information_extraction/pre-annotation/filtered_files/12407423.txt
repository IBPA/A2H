The objective of the study was to determine the effects and the molecular 
background of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and vIL-10 double gene 
transfer into human synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) using the SCID mouse model for cartilage erosion in RA. RA synovial 
fibroblasts were transduced with retro- or adenoviruses encoding IL-1Ra and/or 
viral IL-10 (vIL-10). SCID mice were engrafted subcutaneously with IL-1Ra and 
vIL-10 transduced human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and normal cartilage. In 
parallel, gene expression analysis before and after gene transfer using RNA 
arbitrarily primed PCR in combination with cDNA array was performed. vIL-10 and 
IL-1Ra double gene transfer resulted in inhibition of cartilage invasion and 
degradation by RA synovial fibroblasts when compared with control transduced and 
non-transduced implants. Expression of key genes that were altered after double 
gene transfer were related to the activin pathway. The results demonstrate not 
only that virus-based gene transfer using a combination of two joint-protective 
genes is a feasible approach to inhibit cartilage degradation by activated RA 
synovial fibroblasts, but also that the underlying molecular effects include 
modulation of the activin pathway.
