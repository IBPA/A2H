Targeting the complement component 3a receptor (C3aR) with selective agonists or 
antagonists is believed to be a viable therapeutic option for several diseases 
such as stroke, heart attack, reperfusion injuries, and rheumatoid arthritis. We 
designed a number of agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists of C3aR using 
our two-stage de novo protein design framework. Of the peptides tested using a 
degranulation assay in C3aR-transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, two were 
prominent agonists (EC(50) values of 25.3 and 66.2 nM) and two others were 
partial agonists (IC(50) values of 15.4 and 26.1 nM). Further testing of these 
lead compounds in a calcium flux assay in U937 cells yielded similar results 
although with reduced potencies compared to transfected cells. The partial 
agonists also displayed full antagonist activity when tested in a C3aR 
inhibition assay. In addition, the electrostatic potential profile was shown to 
potentially discriminate between full agonists and partial agonists.
