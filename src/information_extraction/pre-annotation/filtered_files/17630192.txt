TNFalpha is a key factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. To 
investigate whether heterologous TNFalpha gene vaccination could induce 
anti-TNFalpha antibodies via cross-reaction and prevent the inflammatory 
arthritis, we constructed two plasmids by inserting a full-length cDNA of human 
TNFalpha into a secreted vector (pSecTag-TNFalpha) and a non-secreted vector 
(pTARGE-TNFalpha), respectively. Administering either plasmid to 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice reduced paw swelling and 
synovium-infiltrating inflammatory cells. This reduction was accompanied by 
down-regulated TNFalpha in sera and joints. The spleen cells from treated CIA 
mice displayed decreased IFN-gamma mRNA levels and matrix metalloproteinase-9 
bioactivity in comparison with those from CIA control. Furthermore, both 
spontaneous and collagen-specific proliferation of the lymphocytes was 
significantly decreased after treatment. Administration of plasmids led to an 
elicited production of antibodies to both human and mouse TNFalpha. These 
results suggest that human TNFalpha gene vaccination prevents CIA in mice likely 
by inducing cross-reactive antibodies against TNFalpha, and that heterologous 
gene vaccination might provide an effective therapeutic strategy to battle 
TNFalpha mediated diseases.
