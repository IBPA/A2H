Many studies have been carried out in recent years on the pharmacological 
effects of nigella sativa seeds that have uncovered their antiinflammatory and 
immunological effects. The objective of this study was to explore the 
antiinflammatory effects of thymoquinone on arthritis in rat models. Rats with 
arthritis induced by Freund's incomplete adjuvant were assigned into five 
groups: group 1: controls 0.9% NaCl (n = 7); group 2: 2.5 mg/kg thymoquinone (n 
= 7); group 3: 5 mg/kg thymoquinone (n = 7); group 4: Bacilli Chalmette Guerin 
(BCG) 6 x 10(5) CFU (n = 7); group 5: methotrexate 0.3 mg/kg (n = 7). Signs of 
inflammation on the claw and radiological signs were searched for and TNF-alpha 
and IL-1beta were measured. The results of control and other groups were 
compared. As a result, thymoquinone, confirmed clinically and radiologically, 
suppressed adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats.
