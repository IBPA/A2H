Diacerein has proved to be effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. We 
investigated the effects of diacerein in animal models of carrageenin-, 
zymosan-, or dextran-induced paw edema and adjuvant-induced arthritis and in 
ovariectomized rats. In acute inflammatory models, unlike classical nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen and ibuprofen, diacerein inhibited the 
rat paw edema induced by various agents. In the adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, 
diacerein at 100 mg/kg/day significantly suppressed the paw edema and the 
increase in serum mucoprotein. Addition of 3 mg/kg/day naproxen to each 
diacerein (3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day) dose resulted in significantly greater 
anti-inflammatory activity than with naproxen alone. In the ovariectomized rats, 
diacerein (10, 100 mg/kg/day) also significantly prevented bone loss and reduced 
the serum alkaline phosphatase and decreased the excretion of urinary 
hydroxyproline. In addition, rhein (10, 30 microM) inhibited calcium release 
from mouse calvaria induced by interleukin-1 beta, prostaglandin E(2) and 
parathyroid hormone 1-34 human fragment. These findings indicate that diacerein 
is a novel anti-inflammatory drug with pharmacological properties different from 
those of classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and support the clinical 
investigation of the use of combination therapy with diacerein and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with not only osteoarthritis but also 
rheumatoid arthritis.
