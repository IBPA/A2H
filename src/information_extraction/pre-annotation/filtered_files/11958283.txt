The anti-arthritic effect of NM-3, a new isocoumarin, was examined using a type 
II collagen-induced arthritis model for human rheumatoid arthritis in DBA/1J 
mice. NM-3 by oral administration suppressed dose-dependently (2-20 mg/kg/day) 
not only macroscopic changes such as erythema and swelling of limbs but also 
histopathologic changes and radiographic changes such as bone lesions. The 
efficacy of NM-3 was greater than those of disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid 
drugs (DMARDs), auranofin (40 mg/kg/day) and bucillamine (10 mg/kg/day). NM-3 
failed to suppress carageenan-induced edema and to inhibit the activities of 
inflammation-related enzymes including cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, 5-lipoxygenase 
and phospholipase A2, suggesting that the mode of anti-arthritic action of NM-3 
may be different from those of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). 
Since NM-3 inhibits angiogenesis in a mouse dorsal air-sac model, the observed 
anti-arthritic effect of NM-3 might be partly attributed to the antiangiogenic 
activity. Thus, NM-3 is a potential orally active therapeutic agent for the 
treatment of human rheumatoid arthritis.
