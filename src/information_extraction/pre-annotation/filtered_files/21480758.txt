Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is closely related to the pathogenesis of tumor 
necrosis factor Î± in lesions. We investigated the suppressive effects of a 
Citrus flavanone naringin on inflammatory responses in mice with 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model for RA. To investigate potential 
preventive and therapeutic effects of naringin, mice were given naringin orally 
three times a week from the second immunization with collagen (day 21) and from 
day 31, when symptoms of CIA had reached a plateau, respectively. In both cases, 
inflammation-related clinical scores for knee joints were significantly reduced 
by administration of naringin. Histological analyses demonstrated that 
representative phenomena, such as damage to interchondral joints, infiltration 
of inflammatory cells and pannus formation, were significantly depressed by 
treatment with naringin. In addition, increases in the expression of 
high-mobility group box-1 protein in the joints of mice with CIA were suppressed 
by naringin. These results suggest that oral administration of naringin might be 
effective for treating human patients with RA.
