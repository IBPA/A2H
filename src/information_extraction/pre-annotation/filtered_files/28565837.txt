CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and T-helper 17 (Th17) cells have been shown to 
have important roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In our previous study, it was 
demonstrated that artesunate was able to alter the Treg/Th17 ratio in patients 
with RA; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study 
established a male Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model of type II collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). SD rats were divided into normal control, CIA model and 
artesunate-treated (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day) groups. Treg and Th17 cells were 
detected in the synovium by immunohistochemical analysis of forkhead/winged 
helix transcription factor (Foxp3) and interleukin (IL)-17 expression. 
Subsequently, lymphocytes were extracted from the rat spleens, and the 
proportions of Treg/Th17 cells were detected by flow cytometry. The results 
demonstrated that the expression levels of Foxp3 were significantly decreased, 
and those of IL-17 were significantly increased, in the CIA model group, as 
compared with the normal control group. The results demonstrated that artesunate 
decreased the frequency of Th17 cells and increased the frequency of Treg cells 
in CIA rats in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the present study 
suggested that artesunate may regulate the Th17/Treg balance by inducing 
Th17-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, artesunate may be considered a novel 
therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with RA.
