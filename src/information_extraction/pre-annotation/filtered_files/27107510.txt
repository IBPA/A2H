Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are inflammatory joint 
diseases, characterized by pain and structural damage. Besides prostaglandins, 
usually targeted by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other lipids, 
including fatty acids, phospholipids and other bioactive lipid mediators derived 
from fatty acids could also contribute to RA and OA. In this review, we present 
evidence for the role of fatty acids and derivatives in RA and OA by summarizing 
findings related to their presence in serum and synovial fluid, as well as their 
association with clinical characteristics and effects on RA and OA tissues 
inÂ vitro. Finally, a more direct evidence for their role in RA and OA derived 
from intervention studies in humans or mouse models of disease is summarized. 
Based on the presented data, we present a research agenda, in which some key 
unresolved questions regarding the role of lipids in RA and OA are formulated.
