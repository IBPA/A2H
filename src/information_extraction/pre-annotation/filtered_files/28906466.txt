Inhibitor K562 (IK) protein was first isolated from the culture medium of K562, 
a leukemia cell line. It is known to be an inhibitory regulator of 
interferon-γ-induced major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) II expression. 
Previously, we found that transgenic (Tg) mice constitutively expressing 
truncated IK (tIK) showed reduced numbers of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells, 
which are known to be involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Here, we investigated whether exogenous tIK protein has a therapeutic effect in 
arthritis in disease models and analyzed its mechanism. Exogenous tIK protein 
was produced in an insect expression system and applied to the collagen 
antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mouse disease model. Injection of tIK protein 
alleviated the symptoms of arthritis in the CAIA model and reduced Th1 and Th17 
cell populations. In addition, treatment of cultured T cells with tIK protein 
induced expression of A20, a negative regulator of nuclear factor-κB 
(NFκB)-induced inflammation, and reduced expression of several transcription 
factors related to T cell activation. We conclude that exogenous tIK protein has 
the potential to act as a new therapeutic agent for RA patients, because it has 
a different mode of action to biopharmaceutical agents, such as tumor necrosis 
factor antagonists, that are currently used to treat RA.
