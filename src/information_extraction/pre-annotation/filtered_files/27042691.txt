Dysregulation of Trp-Kyn pathway is the most recent hypothesis of mechanisms of 
schizophrenia. In particular, over-production of kynurenic acid (KYNA), one of 
the three immediate downstream metabolites of kynurenine (Kyn) along tryptophan 
(Trp): Kyn pathway, has been considered as a new target for therapeutic 
intervention in schizophrenia. Up-regulation of KYNA formation was suggested to 
occur at the expense of down-regulated production of 3-hydroxyKyn (3-HK), the 
second immediate downstream metabolite of Kyn. We were interested to assess the 
third immediate downstream Kyn metabolite, anthranilic acid (AA). Serum AA 
concentrations were evaluated in schizophrenia patients and control subjects by 
HPLC-mass spectrometry method. We found 2-fold increase of AA and 3-fold 
decrease of 3-HK concentrations in serum of schizophrenia patients. Up regulated 
formation of AA might contribute to mechanisms of schizophrenia considering 
experimental evidences of AA augmentation of autoimmune processes in rat and 
mice; clinical findings of AA elevation in rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 
diabetes, autoimmune diseases diametrical to schizophrenia; and involvement of 
autoimmunity in development of schizophrenia. Present data warrant further 
studies of AA as biological marker in, at least, a subgroup (associated with 
autoimmune mechanisms) of schizophrenia patients and as a new target for 
therapeutic intervention.
