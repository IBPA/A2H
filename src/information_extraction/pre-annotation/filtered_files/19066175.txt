OBJECTIVE: To define genomic regions that link to rat arthritis and to determine 
the potential association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of the corresponding 
human genomic regions.
METHODS: Advanced intercross lines (AIL) between arthritis susceptible DA rats 
and arthritis resistant PVG.1AV1 rats were injected with differently 
arthritogenic oils to achieve an experimental situation with substantial 
phenotypic variation in the rat study population. Genotyping of microsatellite 
markers was performed over genomic regions with documented impact on arthritis, 
located on rat chromosomes 4, 10 and 12. Linkage between genotypes and 
phenotypes were determined by R/quantitative trait loci (QTL). Potential 
association with RA of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in homologous 
human chromosome regions was evaluated from public Wellcome Trust Case Control 
Consortium (WTCCC) data derived from 2000 cases and 3000 controls.
RESULTS: A high frequency of arthritis (57%) was recorded in 422 rats injected 
with pristane. Maximum linkage to pristane-induced arthritis occurred less than 
130 kb from the known genetic arthritis determinants Ncf1 and APLEC, 
demonstrating remarkable mapping precision. Five novel quantitative trait loci 
were mapped on rat chromosomes 4 and 10, with narrow confidence intervals. Some 
exerted sex-biased effects and some were linked to chronic arthritis. Human 
homologous genomic regions contain loci where multiple nearby SNPs associate 
nominally with RA (eg, at the genes encoding protein kinase Calpha and 
interleukin 17 receptor alpha).
CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution mapping in AIL populations defines limited sets of 
candidate risk genes, some of which appear also to associate with RA and thus 
may give clues to evolutionarily conserved pathways that lead to arthritis.
