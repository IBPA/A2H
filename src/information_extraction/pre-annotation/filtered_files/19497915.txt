OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the decrease of cartilage destruction by a novel orally 
active and specific matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) inhibitor in three 
different animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SCID mouse co-implantation model of RA, the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in mice and the antigen-induced arthritis 
model (AIA) in rabbits were used.
RESULTS: In the SCID mouse co-implantation model, the MMP-13 inhibitor reduced 
cartilage destruction by 75%. In the CIA model of RA, the MMP-13 inhibitor 
resulted in a significant and dose-dependent decrease in clinical symptoms as 
well as of cartilage erosion by 38% (30 mg/kg), 28% (10 mg/kg) and 21% (3 
mg/kg). No significant effects were seen in the AIA model. No toxic effects were 
seen in all three animal models.
CONCLUSION: Although several MMPs in concert with other proteinases have a role 
in the process of cartilage destruction, there is a need for highly selective 
MMP inhibitors to reduce severe side effects that occur with non-specific 
inhibitors. Significant inhibition of MMP-13 reduced cartilage erosions in two 
of three tested animal models of RA. These results strongly support the 
development of this class of drugs to reduce or halt joint destruction in 
patients with RA.
