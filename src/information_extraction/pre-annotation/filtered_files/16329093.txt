OBJECTIVE: Clonal populations of CD4+,CD28- T cells accumulating in rheumatoid 
arthritis functionally resemble end-differentiated, nondividing, short-lived 
effector memory cells that reside in peripheral tissues. We undertook this study 
to examine the tissue niche for CD4+,CD28- T cells and the signals regulating 
their survival and tissue homing patterns.
METHODS: Chemokine receptor expression on CD4+,CD28- T cell clones and 
peripheral blood lymphocytes was assessed by multicolor cytometry. In vitro 
chemotaxis and transendothelial migration were examined in a Transwell system. 
In vivo tissue-homing patterns were established by adoptively transferring 
fluorescence-labeled T cell clones into SCID mice engrafted either with 
rheumatoid synovium or with human lymph nodes.
RESULTS: CD4+,CD28- T cell clones adoptively transferred into human tissue-SCID 
mouse chimeras infiltrated rheumatoid synovium but preferentially homed to lymph 
nodes. Such T cells coexpressed the chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR5, and CXCR4 
and migrated in response to both inflammatory chemokines (CCL5) and homing 
chemokines (CXCL12). T cell receptor crosslinking abrogated chemotactic 
responsiveness. In contrast, interleukin-12 stimulation induced the 
up-regulation of CCR5 and a shift in the in vivo homing pattern away from the 
lymph nodes toward the inflamed synovium.
CONCLUSION: CD4+,CD28- T cells resemble both short-lived effector memory cells 
and long-lived central memory cells, and they find a niche both in inflamed 
synovium and in lymph nodes. Nonspecific cytokine stimulation, not antigen 
recognition, triggers the transition from the lymph node to the synovium. By 
maintaining CCR7 expression, these end-differentiated T cells can home to 
lymphoid organs, enhance their survival, support clonal expansion, and 
perpetuate autoreactivity.
