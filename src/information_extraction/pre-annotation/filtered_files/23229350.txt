Euphorbia hirta L. (Euphorbiaceae) (E. hirta) is a tree locally used as a 
traditional medicine in Africa and Australia to treat numerous diseases such as 
hypertension, respiratory ailments, tumors, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory 
activities. In the present study, we investigated the anti-arthritic activity of 
fresh leaves of E. hirta ethanol extract that was found to inhibit the 
production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines of adjuvant arthritis in 
rats. Adjuvant arthritis was induced in rats (Wistar) by the subplantar 
injection of 0.05 ml freshly prepared suspension (5.0 mg/ml) of steam killed 
Mycobacterium tuberculli in liquid paraffin. Animals were treated with graded 
doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of E. hirta ethanol extract, p.o. E. hirta 
significantly inhibited the swelling of the adjuvant-induced arthritis. 
Moreover, E. hirta at higher dose (200 mg/kg) showed 40.54 ± 1.09 % of CD3+, 
15.1 ± 0.76 % of CD4+, 12.2 ± 1.18 % of CD8+ T cell receptor and 17.6 ± 1.11 % 
gated of CD19+ B cell receptor revealing a down regulation of adjuvant-induced 
arthritis as compared to the corresponding valves of the arthritic control rats. 
According to the results shown in Tables 1, 2, the production of IL-1β, TNF-α, 
IL-2 and IFN-γ were increased in splenocytes of arthritic rats and this 
increased level was reduced by E. hirta. Also, E. hirta significantly down 
regulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitric oxide production 
in peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that E. hirta exhibits an 
improvement in adjuvant-induced arthritis through down regulation of activated 
macrophages and T lymphocytes functions. Such unique effects of E. hirta shown 
on adjuvant arthritis rat model may be advantageous to the long-term treatment 
of clinical rheumatoid arthritis. Table 1 Effect of E. hirta and prednisolone
