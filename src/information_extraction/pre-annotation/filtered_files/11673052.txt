The calpains form a growing family of structurally related intracellular 
multidomain cysteine proteinases containing a papain-related catalytic domain, 
whose activity depends on calcium. The calpains are believed to play important 
roles in cytoskeletal remodeling processes, cell differentiation, apoptosis and 
signal transduction, but are also implicated in muscular dystrophy, cardiac and 
cerebral ischemia, platelet aggregation, restenosis, neurodegenerative diseases, 
rheumatoid arthritis and cataract formation. The best characterized calpains, 
the ubiquitously expressed mu- and m-calpains, are heterodimers consisting of a 
common 30-kDa small and a variable 80-kDa subunit. The recently determined 
crystal structures of human and rat m-calpain crystallized in the absence of 
calcium essentially explain the inactivity of the apoform by catalytic domain 
disruption, indicate several sites where calcium could bind causing reformation 
of a papain-like catalytic domain, and additionally reveal modes by which 
phospholipid membranes could reduce the calcium requirement. Current evidence 
points to a cooperative interaction of several sites, which, upon calcium 
binding, trigger the reformation of a papain-similar catalytic domain.
