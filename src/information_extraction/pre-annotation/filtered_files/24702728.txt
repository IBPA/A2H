AIMS: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pain and inflammation are initial symptoms 
followed by various degrees of bone and cartilage destruction. Previously, we 
have shown that reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuates pain and joint 
inflammation in a rat model of adjuvant-arthritis. Our present study aims to 
study the effects of MG132 on molecular changes in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) 
and in the spinal cord (SC) using the same animal model.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced by heat-killed Mycobacterium butyricum in rats. 
The expression of substance P (SP) was analyzed by quantitative reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in DRG and in 
the SC. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA-binding activity in the SC was 
analyzed by electromobility shift assay.
RESULTS: Arthritic rats treated daily with MG132 demonstrated a marked reduction 
of SP gene expression in the DRG and number of SP-positive cells was reduced. In 
the spinal cord of arthritic rats elevated SP messenger RNA levels were 
normalized and NF-κB-DNA-binding activity was down-regulated in arthritic rats 
treated with MG132.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that proteasome inhibitor MG132 attenuates pain 
in adjuvant arthritis by targeting the sensory neuropeptide substance P in the 
peripheral and central nervous systems. These effects may be mediated through 
the inhibition of NF-κB activation.
