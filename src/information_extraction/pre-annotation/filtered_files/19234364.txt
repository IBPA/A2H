The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential therapeutic action 
of RvCSd, an oriental herbal mixture, in an experimental model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). DBA/1J mice were immunized with type II collagen. After a second 
collagen immunization, mice were treated with RvCSd or methotrexate (MTX) orally 
once a day for 35 days, and the incidence, clinical score, and joint 
histopathology were evaluated. The inflammatory response cytokines and cartilage 
protection effect were determined by measuring the levels in the joints and 
sera. The Th1/Th2-mediated auto-reactive response was evaluated by determining 
the proliferative response and cytokines of drained spleen cells stimulated with 
type II collagen. RvCSd treatment significantly reduced the incidence and 
severity of CIA, markedly abrogating joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, and 
cartilage destruction. RvCSd significantly inhibited the production of 
interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6, IL-2, 
interferon (IFN)-gamma, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and up-regulated 
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in mice 
with CIA. In conclusion, RvCSd has therapeutic effects exerted through 
inhibition of inflammatory and Th1 responses, regulation of MMP/TIMP, and 
induction of regulatory T cells in CIA; these effects make RvCSd an outstanding 
candidate for use as an immune suppressive and cartilage protective medicine in 
RA patients.
