Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) is a lysosomal cysteine protease and derived from 
immune granule cells. It has been suggested playing an important role in the 
development of rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, a coumarin based fluorescent 
probe (GF-AFC) was designed and synthesized to evaluate DPPI activity in serum 
or tissue homogenates of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, an inflammatory 
arthropathy model. It was revealed that the fluorescent intensity was 
significantly increased in a very short time after specific substrate GF-AFC 
reacted with the DPPI. The fluorophore (AFC) was released to shine after the 
cleavage reaction which was examined by 19F NMR spectroscopy. It has been shown 
that DPPI hydrolyzed the GF-AFC in a robust, linear, and time dependent manner 
at a significant high rate. A serum-based DPPI activity assay was validated by 
spiking and gradient dilution methods, there were no interferences or 
auto-fluorescence observed. The Coefficient of Variance calculated for 
serum-based DPPI activity assays indicates the good reproducibility. The good 
correlation has been seen between serum DPPI levels and the severity of 
arthritis during RA development in CIA rats. Our study has demonstrated a new 
serum based diagnostic assay for detecting DPPI activity using coumarin 
conjugated fluorescent (GF-AFC) as a substrate. The successful implementation of 
the case would provide beneficial experience in rheumatoid arthritis research.
