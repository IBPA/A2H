OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic factors driving pathogenic autoantibody formation 
in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
in order to better understand the etiology of RA and identify possible new 
avenues for therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide analysis of quantitative trait loci 
controlling autoantibody to type II collagen (anti-CII), anti-citrullinated 
protein antibody (ACPA), and rheumatoid factor (RF). To identify loci 
controlling autoantibody production, we induced CIA in a heterogeneous 
stock-derived mouse cohort, with contribution of 8 inbred mouse strains 
backcrossed to C57BL/10.Q. Serum samples were collected from 1,640 mice before 
arthritis onset and at the peak of the disease. Antibody concentrations were 
measured by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and linkage analysis was 
performed using a linear regression-based method.
RESULTS: We identified loci controlling formation of anti-CII of different IgG 
isotypes (IgG1, IgG3), antibodies to major CII epitopes (C1, J1, U1), antibodies 
to a citrullinated CII peptide (citC1), and RF. The anti-CII, ACPA, and RF 
responses were all found to be controlled by distinct genes, one of the most 
important loci being the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.
CONCLUSION: This comprehensive genetic analysis of autoantibody formation in CIA 
demonstrates an association not only of anti-CII, but interestingly also of ACPA 
and RF, with arthritis development in mice. These results underscore the 
importance of non-major histocompatibility complex genes in controlling the 
formation of clinically relevant autoantibodies.
