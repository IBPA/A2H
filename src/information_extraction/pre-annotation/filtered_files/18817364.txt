The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a central signaling molecule 
in many proinflammatory pathways, regulating the cellular response to a 
multitude of external stimuli including heat, ultraviolet radiation, osmotic 
shock, and a variety of cytokines especially interleukin-1beta and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha. Thus, inhibitors of this enzyme are postulated to have 
significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, osteoporosis, and many other diseases where aberrant 
cytokine signaling is the driver of disease. Herein, we describe a novel class 
of 3-amino-7-phthalazinylbenzoisoxazole-based inhibitors. With relatively low 
molecular weight, these compounds are highly potent in enzyme and cell-based 
assays, with minimal protein shift in 50% human whole blood. Compound 3c was 
efficacious (ED 50 = 0.05 mg/kg) in the rat collagen induced arthritis (CIA) 
model.
