One of the gold standards for animal models of rheumatoid arthritis is the 
murine collagen-induced arthritis model. Native type II collagen together with 
CFA is injected into susceptible mouse strains. Unfortunately, only mice with 
H-2q or H-2r MHC haplotypes are susceptible, making the widely used C57BL/6 
mouse strain, which carries the H-2b haplotype, resistant against the disease. 
In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Stevanin etÂ al. [Eur. J. 
Immunol. 2017. 47: 637-645] now convincingly show that although WT C57BL/6 mice 
are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis, mice with a homozygous deletion of 
CD11b on the same genetic background are fully susceptible in this important 
animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. They clearly demonstrate that the 
injection of type II collagen together with CFA leads to early onset of the 
disease with high incidence and with sustained severity. The authors further 
characterize this disease with an increase of leukocyte infiltration and 
enhanced TH17 differentiation.
