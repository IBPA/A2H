The mammalian clock genes, Period and Cryptochrome (Cry), regulate circadian 
rhythm. We show that circadian rhythmicity and rhythmic expression of Period in 
the nuclei of inflammatory synovial cells and spleen cells are disturbed in 
mouse models of experimental arthritis. Expressions of other clock genes, Bmal1 
and Dbp, are also disturbed in spleen cells by arthritis induction. Deletion of 
Cry1 and Cry2 results in an increase in the number of activated CD3(+) CD69(+) T 
cells and a higher production of TNF-alpha from spleen cells. When arthritis is 
induced, Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice develop maximal exacerbation of joint swelling, 
and upregulation of essential mediators of arthritis, including TNF-alpha, 
IL-1beta and IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase-3. Wee-1 kinase is solely 
upregulated in Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice, in line with upregulation of c-Fos and 
Wee-1 kinase in human rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment with anti-TNF-alpha Ab 
significantly reduced the severity and halted the progression of the arthritis 
of Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice and vice versa, ectopic expression of Cry1 in the 
mouse embryonic fibroblast from Cry1(-/-)Cry2(-/-) mice significantly reduced 
the trans activation of TNF-alpha gene. Thus, the biological clock and arthritis 
influence each other, and this interplay can influence human health and disease.
