The objective of the present study was to determine whether the expression of 
connexin 43 (Cx43) effected on inflammatory conditions in rat fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLS) and on rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The expression 
of Cx43 in rat FLS stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was confirmed by 
real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effects 
of small-interfering RNA targeting Cx43 (siCx43) on pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokine were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). The therapeutic and side effects of siCx43 in a rat model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were examined by in vivo electroporation 
method. LPS markedly enhanced Cx43 gene expression in rat FLS, with transfection 
of siCx43 suppressing the over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the 
chemokine. Treatment of CIA rats with siCx43 significantly ameliorated paw 
swelling, and significantly reduced histological arthritis scores and 
radiographic scores. In histological appearance of rat ankle joints, siCx43 
treatment significantly decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP)-positive (osteoclast-like) cells. These findings indicated 
that siCx43 had anti-inflammatory effects in rat FLS and efficiently inhibited 
the development of CIA. Cx43 may play an important role in the pathophysiology 
of RA, and may be a potential target molecule for novel RA therapies.
