OBJECTIVES: The evaluation of joints in arthritis using conventional 
ultrasonography is not really feasible in mice because of the small size of the 
animal. However, compared with classical analysis (clinical and histological 
examination) it is a non-invasive method that allows follow-up of the same 
animal throughout the whole experiment. Moreover, power Doppler allows the study 
of blood flow that reflects inflammatory activity within the synovium of 
arthritic joints. Our aim was to determine whether ultrasonography analysis 
could accurately detect arthritis lesions in a mouse model of rheumatoid 
arthritis, namely collagen-induced arthritis.
METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis was induced in 28 mice by immunising with 
collagen type II. Every week for 8 weeks, ultrasonography and Doppler analysis 
were performed on knees and ankles of all mice using the ultrasound 
biomicroscope (UBM), which is particularly dedicated to studying the mouse. 
Clinical and histological evaluations were performed as usual.
RESULTS: We established a semiquantitative analysis by setting an UBM scoring. 
UBM grades were correlated to clinical and histological scores of arthritis. 
Vascularisation within the synovium could be estimated by power Doppler analysis 
and a semiquantitative vascularisation scale was established, which allowed us 
to show a good correlation between vascularisation scores and histological or 
clinical scores of arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies that shows it is possible to 
visualise a selected set of joints in a small animal using UBM analysis. It 
provides new perspectives in evaluating experimental models of rheumatoid 
arthritis and other joint diseases.
