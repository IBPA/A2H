Monocyte infiltration is implicated in a variety of diseases including multiple 
myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. C-C chemokine receptor 1 
(CCR1) is a chemokine receptor that upon stimulation, particularly by macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and regulated on normal T-cell 
expressed and secreted (RANTES), mediates monocyte trafficking to sites of 
inflammation. High throughput screening of our combinatorial collection 
identified a novel, moderately potent CCR1 antagonist 3. The library hit 3 was 
optimized to the advanced lead compound 4. Compound 4 inhibited CCR1 mediated 
chemotaxis of monocytes with an IC(50) of 20 nM. In addition, the compound was 
highly selective over other chemokine receptors. It had good microsomal 
stability when incubated with rat and human liver microsomes and showed no 
significant cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the 
compound in the rat showed good oral bioavailability.
