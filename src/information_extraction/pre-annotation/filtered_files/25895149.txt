Sinomenine (SIN), an alkaloid derived from the plant Sinomenium acutum, has 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and has been used for rheumatoid 
arthritis treatment in China. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that SIN 
acts on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) to inhibit the activation 
of macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. The prototypical α7nAChR 
antagonist α-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine attenuated the effect of SIN on tumor 
necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells and 
primary peritoneal macrophages of mouse induced by lipopolysaccharide. With the 
knockdown of α7nAChR expression in RAW264.7 cells by small interfering RNA, the 
inhibitory effect of SIN on tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 was 
reversed. Sinomenine decreased p65 expression in nuclear and increased IκBα 
expression in cytoplasm, and these effects were reversed by the α7nAChR small 
interfering RNA as well. These results indicate that the anti-inflammatory 
effects of SIN on macrophages in vitro depend on α7nAChR.
