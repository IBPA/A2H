Among various factors advancing bone loss, immobility is the most remarkable 
cause to deteriorate osteoporosis. In the animal experiment, we could be obvious 
that immobilization of femur by suspension of rat tail reduced calcium content 
of bone through diminished blood circulation of bone, especially in femoral 
neck. In stroke patients who are often suffered from femoral neck fracture, bone 
mineral measurement revealed bone loss in paralyzed limb, in addition to healthy 
limb. Bone loss in both limbs in the hemiplegic patient and the fragility of 
femoral neck are caused by decrease of daily activity. Low nutrition in the 
patients who are took gastrectomy and suffered from rheumatoid arthritis is 
pointed out as the other factor inducing severe osteoporosis.
