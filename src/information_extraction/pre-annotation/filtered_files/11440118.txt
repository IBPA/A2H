Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) can be induced in DBA/1J mice by immunization 
with bovine type II collagen (bCII) and is a model of some types of human 
autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis. In this study we examined whether 
preimmunization of the mice with various antigens could inhibit the development 
of CIA. Preimmunization of the mice with an extract of the house dust mite 
Dermatophagoides farinae (mite antigen), chicken ovalbumin, or keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin strongly inhibited CIA development, but hen egg lysozyme, 
beta-lactoglobulin from bovine milk or myelin basic protein from guinea pig 
brain did not substantially affect CIA development. Splenic T cells and serum 
antibodies specific for mite antigen did not cross-react with bCII. 
Preimmunization of the mice with mite antigen did not affect the IFN-gamma and 
proliferative response of splenic T cells to bCII, nor serum antibody responses. 
The most inhibitory constituent had a molecular weight between 1,000 and 10,000.
