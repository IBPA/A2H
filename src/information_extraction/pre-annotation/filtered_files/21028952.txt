The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been 
widely employed, but, owing to their systemic side-effects and also their 
susceptibility to the first pass metabolism, their use is being discouraged. To 
circumvent this, triamcinolone (TA) were encapsulated in chitosan microspheres 
with glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking agent to achieve a prolonged drug 
release. The percentage of drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and surface 
morphology by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Phase transition by 
Differential scanning colorimetry (DSC), as well as Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) studies was carried out to characterize the chitosan 
microspheres. In-vitro and in-vivo release studies revealed that microspheres 
were able to control the release of TA with a uniform release pattern up to a 
period of 36 days and thereafter an extended release up to 63 days. The clinical 
parameters were investigated for changes in paw volume, hematological parameters 
like Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Paced cell volume (PCV), Total 
leucocyte count (TLC), Hb, and Differential cell count (DCC) in Fruend's 
complete adjuvant induced arthritic rats. Histopathological findings as well as 
radiology (X-ray) further confirmed the effectiveness of TA encapsulated 
microspheres in mitigating the rat arthritic model.
