1 Gold(I)-thiolate drugs are compounds that specifically interact with thiol 
and/or selenol groups and are essentially utilized in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis. 2 Considering the importance of thiol groups in regulating 
mitochondrial membrane permeability, the effects of auranofin 
(S-triethylphosphinegold(I)-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-thio-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
a second-generation gold drug, were studied on mitochondria isolated from rat 
liver. 3 Auranofin, at submicromolar concentrations, was able to induce the 
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition observed as swelling and loss of 
membrane potential. Both events are completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, the 
specific inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition. Calcium ions and 
energization by succinate are required for the occurrence of permeability 
transition. 4 By interacting with the active site selenol group, auranofin 
results as an extremely potent inhibitor of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase, 
both isolated and in its mitochondrial environment. 5 It is concluded that 
auranofin, in the presence of calcium ions, is a highly efficient inducer of 
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, potentially referable to its 
inhibition of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase.
