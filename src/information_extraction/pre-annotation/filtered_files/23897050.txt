OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mechanism of fractalkine (FKN)/CX3 CL1 synthesis and 
shedding in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and in rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA).
METHODS: The effect of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and/or interferon-γ (IFNγ) 
on FKN synthesis and shedding in human RASFs was determined over time by 
immunostaining, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 
and Western blotting. The role of protease enzymes and signaling pathways was 
evaluated using chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). The 
activity of 20S proteasome in the lysates and the DNA binding of NF-κB/p65 in 
the nuclear fractions were evaluated. The in vivo relevance of these findings 
was examined in rat AIA.
RESULTS: In RASFs, stimulation with the combination of TNFα and IFNγ induced 
cellular expression of FKN within 24 hours. Activation of ADAM-17, but not 
ADAM-10, partly mediated the proteolytic shedding and release of soluble FKN 
(sFKN) following TNFα/IFNγ stimulation for 24-72 hours. Compared with control 
siRNA, ADAM-17 siRNA markedly inhibited TNFα/IFNγ-induced sFKN production (by 
∼33%). TNFα/IFNγ-induced sFKN release was markedly suppressed by inhibitors of 
ADAM-17, p38 MAPK, proteasome, or cathepsin inhibitor but not by inhibitors of 
caspase 3 or calpain. TNFα/IFNγ-induced proteasome activity also correlated with 
rapid degradation of IκBα and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In vivo findings showed 
increased FKN expression in the joints of rats with AIA, which correlated with 
increased expression of ADAM-17 and phospho-p38 MAPK.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide new understanding of the role of ADAM-17, p38 
MAPK, cathepsins, and the proteasome pathway in FKN expression and shedding. 
Regulating these pathways may suppress FKN-mediated inflammation and tissue 
destruction.
