Chrysanthemum zawadskii var. latilobum (CZ) has been used for beverage or tea 
and also as folk medicine for the remedy of diverse inflammatory diseases. 
Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of CZ on arthritis remains to be unknown. 
In this paper we aim to investigate the CZ's antiarthritic effect and mechanism 
of action both in vitro and in vivo. To assess CZ's antiarthritic effect, mouse 
models of type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were used. Mice were used to 
gauge clinical arthritis index and histopathological changes. Reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting, 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and other biological methods were 
adopted to measure CZ's effect on arthritis and to understand the veiled 
mechanism of action. CZ greatly suppressed CIA, histopathological score, bone 
erosion, and osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, CZ inhibited the 
production of various inflammatory and arthritic mediators like inflammatory 
cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and chemokines. Of note, CZ 
significantly suppressed the activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway in vivo. CZ exerted 
an antiarthritic effect in CIA mice by curbing the production of crucial 
inflammatory and arthritis mediators. This study warrants further investigation 
of CZ for the use in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
