OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of L-asparaginase as an 
immunosuppressive agent in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Male DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated at 
different intervals with various doses of native and pegylated L-asparaginase 
from E. coli. The mice were observed for 4 weeks during which time arthritis was 
scored. Outcome parameters included effect on severity and progression of 
established arthritis as well as prevention of disease. In addition, X-rays from 
the affected joints were obtained for comparison.
RESULTS: Both native L-asparaginase at a dose of 50 IU/injection 
intraperitoneally three days a week and pegylated asparaginase 
(PEG-L-asparaginase) at a dose of 25 IU/injection twice a week, significantly 
reduced the mean arthritic score (MAS) in mice with established arthritis (p < 
0.001 for PEG-L-asparaginase). When native L-asparaginase was administered 
before the onset of arthritis (days 14-post immunization) the number of mice 
developing arthritis as well as the number of arthritic paws and the severity of 
arthritis in the treatment group were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001). 
Significant differences were found in the X-ray evaluation between treated and 
control mice. None of the animals died due to drug related events or showed 
signs of asparaginase induced toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide the first direct evidence that L-asparaginase is a 
potent antiarthritic agent and may represent an effective second line agent for 
future treatment studies in juvenile and adult rheumatoid arthritis.
