Allograft inflammatory factor-1 is the protein that expressed in the macrophages 
around the coronary arteries in rat ectopic cardiac allograft model. AIF-1 is 
produced mainly by macrophages and regulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). There 
are various splicing valiants in AIF-1, and the functions are different. AIF-1 
has Ca-binding EF-hand motif that induces cell proliferation and migration by 
structural features. Besides cell proliferation and migration, AIF-1 contributes 
to secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-10, 
IL-12, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), insulin resistance by 
downregulation of GLUT4 or IRS-1, and fibrosis process by upregulation of 
collagen production. It has been elucidated that AIF-1 is responsible for the 
onset of various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis, 
atherosclerotic disease, diabetes mellitus. AIF-1 may have the therapeutic 
potential for chronic inflammatory diseases by elucidation of the mechanism.
