To compare efficacy of different extracts from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. with both 
immune inflammation and joint destruction in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) 
rat model. Rats were divided into normal group (Nor), control group (CIA), TG 
group (treated with tripterygium glycoside), E70 group (treated with 70% ethanol 
extract from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.), EA group (treated with ethyl acetate 
fraction from E70), and EN group (treated with n-butyl alcohol fraction from 
E70). All extracts from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. could significantly inhibit 
ankle swelling, pathological manifestations, and cytokine levels in serum and 
spleen, by using foot volume measurement, H&E staining, ELISA, and RT-QPCR 
methods, respectively. All extracts could significantly inhibit rough joint 
surface and marginal osteophytes, improve RANKL/OPG ratio, and decrease MMP-9 
expression, by using micro-CT and immunohistochemical staining. The activation 
of IKK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway was also inhibited by all extracts. In addition, 
ethyl acetate fraction from E70 presented better effect on RANKL/OPG system. 
This study identified effective extracts from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. relieving 
immune inflammation and maintaining structural integrity of joints in CIA rats.
