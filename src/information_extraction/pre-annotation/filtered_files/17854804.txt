MIF was recently redefined as an inflammatory cytokine, which functions as a 
critical mediator of diseases such as septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, 
atherosclerosis, and cancer. MIF also regulates wound healing processes. Given 
that fibroblast migration is a central event in wound healing and that MIF was 
recently demonstrated to promote leukocyte migration through an interaction with 
G-protein-coupled receptors, we investigated the effect of MIF on fibroblast 
migration in wounded monolayers in vitro. Transient but not permanent exposure 
of primary mouse or human fibroblasts with MIF significantly promoted wound 
closure, a response that encompassed both a proliferative and a pro-migratory 
component. Importantly, MIF-induced fibroblast activation was accompanied by an 
induction of calcium signalling, whereas chronic exposure with MIF 
down-regulated the calcium transient, suggesting receptor desensitization as the 
underlying mechanism.
