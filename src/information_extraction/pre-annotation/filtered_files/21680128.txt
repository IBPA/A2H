SKLB010 is currently under development as a potential therapeutic agent for the 
treatment of acute hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this paper 
was to investigate the pre-clinical pharmacokinetics of SKLB010 in beagle dogs. 
An ultra performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectroscopy 
(UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantitative 
determination of SKLB010 in dog plasma, using rosiglitazone as the internal 
standard (I.S.). Plasma samples were prepared by a simple solid phase extraction 
(SPE) method. The analyte and internal standard were separated by an Acquity 
UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 mm × 50 mm) column with a mobile phase of methanol-water 
(80/20, v/v) over 2 min. Detection was based on the multiple reaction monitoring 
with the precursor-to-product ion transitions m/z 234.10→147.92 (SKLB010) and 
m/z 356.15→150.00 (I.S.). The method was validated according to FDA guidelines 
on bio-analytical method validation. The selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, 
accuracy, precision, extraction recovery, ion suppression and stability were 
within the acceptable ranges. The method described above was successfully 
applied to reveal the single- and multi-pharmacokinetic profiles of SKLB010 in 
beagle dogs and should be extendable to pharmacokinetic studies in other species 
as well.
