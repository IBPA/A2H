Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease. Gallium 
nitrate has been reported to reserve immunosuppressive activities. Therefore, we 
assessed the therapeutic effects of gallium nitrate in the mouse model of 
developed type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA was induced by bovine 
type II collagen with Complete Freund's adjuvant. CIA mice were 
intraperitoneally treated from day 36 to day 49 after immunization with 
3.5mg/kg/day, 7mg/kg/day gallium nitrate or vehicle. Gallium nitrate ameliorated 
the progression of mice with CIA. The clinical symptoms of collagen-induced 
arthritis did not progress after treatment with gallium nitrate. Gallium nitrate 
inhibited the increase of CD4(+) T cell populations (p<0.05) and also inhibited 
the type II collagen-specific IgG2a-isotype autoantibodies (p<0.05). Gallium 
nitrate reduced the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ (p<0.05) and the mRNA 
expression levels of these cytokine and MMPs (MMP2 and MMP9) in joint tissues. 
Western blotting of members of the NF-κB signaling pathway revealed that gallium 
nitrate inhibits the activation of NF-κB by blocking IκB degradation. These data 
suggest that gallium nitrate is a potential therapeutic agent for autoimmune 
inflammatory arthritis through its inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, and these 
results may help to elucidate gallium nitrate-mediated mechanisms of 
immunosuppression in patients with RA.
