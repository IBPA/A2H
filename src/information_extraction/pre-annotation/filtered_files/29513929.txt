OBJECTIVE: To develop a new chronic rheumatoid arthritis model that is driven by 
the innate immune system.
METHODS: Injection of a cocktail of 4 monoclonal antibodies against type II 
collagen, followed on days 5 and 60 by intraperitoneal injections of mannan 
(from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), was used to induce development of chronic 
arthritis in B10.Q mice. The role of the innate immune system as compared to the 
adaptive immune system in this arthritis model was investigated using 
genetically modified mouse strains.
RESULTS: A new model of chronic relapsing arthritis was characterized in B10.Q 
mice, in which a persistently active, chronic disease was found. This relapsing 
disease was driven by macrophages lacking the ability to mount a reactive oxygen 
species response against pathogens, and was associated with the 
classical/alternative pathway, but not the lectin pathway, of complement 
activation. The disease was independent of FcÎ³ receptor type III, and also 
independent of the activity of adaptive immune cells (B and T cells), indicating 
that the innate immune system, involving complement activation, could be the 
sole driver of chronicity.
CONCLUSION: Chronic active arthritis can be driven innately by macrophages 
without the involvement of T and B cells in the adaptive immune system.
