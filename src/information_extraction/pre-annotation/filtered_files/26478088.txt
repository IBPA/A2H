Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is an endogenous intermediate of the glycolytic 
pathway. Exogenous administration of FBP has been shown to exert protective 
effects in a variety of ischemic injury models, which are attributed to its 
ability to sustain glycolysis and increase ATP production. Here, we demonstrated 
that a single treatment with FBP markedly attenuated arthritis, assessed by 
reduction of articular hyperalgesia, joint swelling, neutrophil infiltration and 
production of inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL-6, while enhancing IL-10 
production in two mouse models of arthritis. Our mechanistic studies showed that 
FBP reduces joint inflammation through the systemic generation of extracellular 
adenosine and subsequent activation of adenosine receptor A2a (A2aR). Moreover, 
we showed that FBP-induced adenosine generation requires hydrolysis of 
extracellular ATP through the activity of the ectonucleosides triphosphate 
diphosphohydrolase-1 (ENTPD1, also known as CD39) and ecto-5'-nucleotidase 
(E5NT, also known as CD73). In accordance, inhibition of CD39 and CD73 abolished 
anti-arthritic effects of FBP. Taken together, our findings provide a new 
insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of 
FBP, showing that it effectively attenuates experimental arthritis by activating 
the anti-inflammatory adenosinergic pathway. Therefore, FBP may represent a new 
therapeutic strategy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
