Cigarette smoking is a major environmental risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). However, the experimental bases supporting the etiological role of 
cigarette smoking in RA have not been fully provided. We have reported that 
cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), by means of subcutaneous injection into DBA/1J 
mice with collagen and complete Freund's adjuvant or intraperitoneal injection 
one day before immunization, augmented the development of arthritis in the mouse 
model of collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA). However, these experimental 
procedures may not be appropriate for cigarette smoking. In this study, we 
nasally exposed mice to mainstream CSC and found that CSC augmented the 
induction and development of arthritis and antibody level against collagen. 
Histological examination confirmed the augmenting effect of CSC. These findings 
provide experimental bases supporting the etiological role of cigarette smoking 
in RA.
