Activated macrophages play a key role in the development and maintenance of 
inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, lupus, psoriasis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and many others. These activated macrophages, but 
not resting or quiescent macrophages highly up-regulate folate receptor beta 
(FR-β). This differential expression of FR-β provides a mechanism to selectively 
deliver imaging and therapeutic agents utilizing folate as a targeting molecule. 
In an effort to determine whether inflammatory diseases can be targeted 
utilizing a folate-linked nanosize carrier, a PEG-coated liposome was prepared 
that incorporated a folate conjugated PEG that also could transport imaging or 
therapeutic cargo. We demonstrate that these folate-liposomes specifically bind 
to folate receptor positive cells and accumulate at sites of inflammation in 
mouse models of colitis and atherosclerosis. These two animal models show that 
folate-targeted liposomes could be successfully utilized to deliver fluorescent 
molecules and an anti-inflammatory drug (betamethasone) for diagnostic and 
therapeutic applications.
