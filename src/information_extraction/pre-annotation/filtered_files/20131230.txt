OBJECTIVE: To define the intrinsic capacity of fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLS) to establish a 3-dimensional (3-D) complex synovial lining architecture 
characterized by the multicellular organization of the compacted synovial lining 
and the elaboration of synovial fluid constituents.
METHODS: FLS were cultured in spherical extracellular matrix (ECM) micromasses 
for 3 weeks. The FLS micromass architecture was assessed histologically and 
compared with that of dermal fibroblast controls. Lubricin synthesis was 
measured via immunodetection. Basement membrane matrix and reticular fiber 
stains were performed to examine ECM organization. Primary human and mouse 
monocytes were prepared and cocultured with FLS in micromass to investigate 
cocompaction in the lining architecture. Cytokine stimuli were applied to 
determine the capacity for inflammatory architecture rearrangement.
RESULTS: FLS, but not dermal fibroblasts, spontaneously formed a compacted 
lining architecture over 3 weeks in the 3-D ECM micromass organ cultures. These 
lining cells produced lubricin. FLS rearranged their surrounding ECM into a 
complex architecture resembling the synovial lining and supported the survival 
and cocompaction of monocyte/macrophages in the neo-lining structure. 
Furthermore, when stimulated by cytokines, FLS lining structures displayed 
features of the hyperplastic rheumatoid arthritis synovial lining.
CONCLUSION: This 3-D micromass organ culture method demonstrates that many of 
the phenotypic characteristics of the normal and the hyperplastic synovial 
lining in vivo are intrinsic functions of FLS. Moreover, FLS promote survival 
and cocompaction of primary monocytes in a manner remarkably similar to that of 
synovial lining macrophages. These findings provide new insight into inherent 
functions of the FLS lineage and establish a powerful in vitro method for 
further investigation of this lineage.
