Modern pharmacological studies revealed that Celastrol exhibits 
anti‑inflammation, anti‑bacteria, anti‑virus, anti‑fertility, insect‑resistance 
functions and has been used for the treatment of rheumatism, rheumatoid 
arthritis, blood diseases, skin diseases and agricultural insecticide. The 
present study aimed to investigate the effects of Celastrol on 
glucocorticoid‑induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms. The findings of the current study revealed that Celastrol reduced 
body weight, urine calcium/creatinine, tartrate‑resistant acid phosphatase 5b, 
C‑terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and induced osteocalcin in GIOP rats. 
In addition, alkaline phosphatase, triiodothyronine receptor auxiliary protein 
and cathepsin K mRNA expression levels were effectively suppressed, and 
osteocalcin, bone morphogenetic protein 2, type I collagen and runt‑related 
transcription factor 2 mRNA expression levels were effectively induced in 
osteoporosis rats treated with Celastrol. Celastrol inhibited prostaglandin E2 
and caspase‑3 protein expression levels, and induced phosphoinositol 3‑kinase 
(PI3K), phosphorylated‑protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase‑3 
phosphorylation, Wnt and β‑catenin protein expression in GIOP rats. The present 
study demonstrated that Celastrol may inhibit GIOP in rats via the PI3K/AKT and 
Wnt signaling pathways.
