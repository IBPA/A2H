Silibinin, a natural polyphenolic flavonoid, possesses anti-oxidant, 
anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties. The present study was designed to 
investigate the effects of silibinin on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
pathogenesis-related cells and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and further 
explore the potential underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that silibinin 
suppressed cell viability and increased the percentage of apoptotic 
RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Furthermore, the production of 
inflammatory cytokines in RA-FLS and a CIA rat model was effectively inhibited 
by silibinin. Silibinin also induced macrophage M2 polarization in RAW264.7 
cells. We further demonstrated that silibinin inhibits Th17 cell differentiation 
in vitro. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway was suppressed in RA-FLS. 
In addition, Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) was decreased after silibinin treatment, and 
RA-FLS transfection with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of SIRT1 enhanced 
silibinin-induced apoptosis. Autophagy was markedly decreased in a 
dose-dependent manner following silibinin treatment. These findings indicate 
that silibinin inhibited inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, and SIRT1 
may participate in silibinin-induced apoptosis. Silibinin also inhibited 
autophagy in RA-FLS. Thus, silibinin may be a potential therapeutic agent for 
the treatment of RA.
