The aim of this study was to develop a pectin-based colon-specific 
multiparticulate delivery system. Aceclofenac was used as a model drug owing to 
its potential therapeutic efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. Pectin microspheres 
were prepared using emulsion dehydration technique. These microspheres were 
coated with Eudragit S-100 using solvent evaporation method. The effect of 
different variables (polymer, emulsifier, stirring speed and stirring time) was 
investigated in terms of size, surface morphology, entrapment efficiency, in 
vitro release and in vivo studies. The size of uncoated microspheres ranged from 
30 to 55 Âµm and exhibited 5-40% of drug release in the upper gastrointestinal 
tract; however, continuous high release of drug was observed at colonic pH. In 
addition, the release of drug from the microspheres was found to be higher in 
the presence of rat cecal contents with maximum release at the 8th hour. This is 
one of the prerequisites for the effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, 
indicating the effect of colonic enzymes on the pectin microspheres. In vivo 
studies suggest the maintenance of therapeutic concentration of drug for 24 h 
with significant anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, these findings clearly 
suggest that the Eudragit-coated pectin microspheres offer an exciting mode of 
aceclofenac delivery to colon in the chronopharmacological treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
