AIM: We endeavored to create a folate-targeted liposome (Fol-liposome) that 
could selectively target areas of inflammation.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Fol-liposomes were prepared with encapsulated DiD 
fluorophore or betamethasone (BM) to image and treat an adjuvant-induced rat 
model of rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS: Fol-liposomes selectively accumulated in arthritic rat paws to a 
greater extent than nontargeted liposomes. When these Fol-liposomes were used to 
encapsulate BM and administered to arthritic rats, animals exhibited less paw 
swelling, lower arthritis scores, a reduction in bone erosion, less splenomegaly 
and better maintenance of body weight when compared with nontreated or 
nontargeted BM-containing liposome groups.
CONCLUSION: Fol-liposomes can selectively deliver imaging and therapeutic agents 
to sites of inflammation in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis.
