Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a 
proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in pathogenesis of abnormal or 
disregulated inflammation. To verify how TWEAK/fibroblast growth 
factor-inducible gene 14 (Fn14) signals affect development of Th17 cells in 
arthritis, we utilized the SKG mouse, which spontaneously develops Th17-mediated 
autoimmune arthritis. Fn14-Fc was administered to zymosan A-induced 
arthritogenic SKG mice, and the effects in vivo were examined. Destruction of 
cartilage and bone damage was assessed by Hematoxylin and Eosin, and safranin O 
staining of the affected tissues. Phenotypic analysis of cells expressing 
inflammatory cytokines and angiogenesis-related factors, and the expression of 
transcription factor STAT3 in the affected joints were determined by 
immunohistochemistry. Blockade of Fn14 with Fn14-Fc reduced the clinical and 
histologic scores of inflammatory arthritis in the mouse model of spontaneously 
developed chronic autoimmune arthritis. Fn14-Fc suppressed production of 
inflammatory cytokines and angiogenesis-promoting factors, such as vascular 
endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 3. Moreover, blocking of 
the TWEAK signal inhibited expression of STAT3 as well as interleukin-17 and -21 
produced by Th17 cells. These results implicate TWEAK as a potential molecular 
target for treatment or prevention of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
