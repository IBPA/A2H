Novel potent trisubstituted pyridazine inhibitors of p38 MAP (mitogen activated 
protein) kinase are described that have activity in both cell-based assays of 
cytokine release and animal models of rheumatoid arthritis. They demonstrated 
potent inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in mice and exhibited good 
efficacy in the rat collagen induced arthritis model.
