AKT and ERK pathways have been implicated as therapeutic targets for human 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) inhibition, and 
thus RA treatment. Sprouty2 (SPRY2) has been known as a tumor suppressor by 
blocking both ERK and AKT signaling cascades. Whether SPRY2 can function as a 
suppressor of tumor-like inflammatory FLS and RA through negatively regulating 
AKT and ERK activation has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to 
determine whether SPRY2 might have antiarthritic effects in experimental animal 
model of RA. We first determined that expression of SPRY2 mRNA was decreased in 
FLS from patients with RA compared with patients with osteoarthritis (OA). 
Further studies demonstrated that intraarticular gene transfer with AdSPRY2, the 
recombinant adenovirus containing SPRY2 complementary DNA, resulted in a 
significant suppression of rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) compared with 
the control AdGFP, the adenoviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein, as 
reflected in both clinical and histological observations. AdSPRY2 suppressed the 
production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 
and the activation of ERK and AKT signals in AIA ankle joints. These results 
suggest that using SPRY2 to block the AKT and ERK pathways effectively reduces 
the inflammatory responses and arthritic progression in AIA. Thus, the 
development of an immunoregulatory strategy based on SPRY2 may therefore have 
therapeutic potential in the treatment of RA.
