Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators of mammalian cellular damage and 
are associated with diseases such as aging, arteriosclerosis, inflammation, 
rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Type 1 diabetes develops upon the destruction 
of pancreatic β-cells, which is partly due to ROS activity. In this study, we 
investigated the cytoprotective and anti-oxidative effects of fractionated 
mulberry extracts in mouse insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells (MIN6N cells). 
Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced significant cell death and 
increased intracellular ROS levels, lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation in 
the MIN6N cells. Fractionated mulberry extracts significantly reduced the 
H2O2-dependent production of intracellular ROS, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH) radicals and lipid peroxidation. In addition, mulberry extracts inhibited 
DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2. Thus, the antioxidant properties of mulberry 
extracts in pancreatic β-cells may be exploited for the prevention or treatment 
of type 1 diabetes.
