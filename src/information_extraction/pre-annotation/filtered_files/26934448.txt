The membrane-associated matrix metalloproteinase-14, MT1-MMP, has been 
implicated in pericellular proteolysis with an important role in cellular 
invasion of collagenous tissues. It is substantially upregulated in various 
cancers and rheumatoid arthritis, and has been considered as a potential 
therapeutic target. Here, we report the identification of antibody fragments to 
MT1-MMP that potently and specifically inhibit its cell surface functions. Lead 
antibody clones displayed inhibitory activity towards pro-MMP-2 activation, 
collagen-film degradation and gelatin-film degradation, and were shown to bind 
to the MT1-MMP catalytic domain outside the active site cleft, inhibiting 
binding to triple helical collagen. Affinity maturation using CDR3 randomization 
created a second generation of antibody fragments with dissociation constants 
down to 0.11 nM, corresponding to an improved affinity of 332-fold with the 
ability to interfere with cell-surface MT1-MMP functions, displaying IC50 values 
down to 5 nM. Importantly, the new inhibitors were able to inhibit collagen 
invasion by tumor-cells in vitro and in vivo primary tumor growth and metastasis 
of MDA-MB-231 cells in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Herein is the first 
demonstration that an inhibitory antibody targeting sites outside the catalytic 
cleft of MT1-MMP can effectively abrogate its in vivo activity during 
tumorigenesis and metastasis.
