PURPOSE: In vivo detection of pathological insults during the early stages of 
rheumatoid synovitis is essential to allow early anti-inflammatory treatment for 
prevention of joint destruction. Whether rheumatoid synovitis pathology and the 
efficacy of therapies can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) 
tracers specific to the inflammatory process was investigated.
PROCEDURES: Using a collagen-induced experimental rat model of rheumatoid 
arthritis, in vivo imaging using the PET tracers [11C]PK11195, which binds to 
the translocator protein mainly expressed on myeloid cells, and [11C]ketoprofen, 
for cyclooxygenase imaging, was performed. To evaluate therapeutic efficacy, 
model animals were administered the tumour necrosis factor alpha blocker 
etanercept subcutaneously.
RESULTS: [11C]PK11195 and [11C]ketoprofen uptakes were significantly higher in 
inflamed paws of collagen-induced arthritis rats than in normal rats. The data 
showed a correlation between tracer uptake values and paw swelling. After 
treatment with etanercept, [11C]ketoprofen uptake was significantly lower in 
treated animals than in untreated ones, whereas [11C]PK11195 uptake in the 
inflamed regions was comparable to that in the untreated group.
CONCLUSIONS: With [11C]PK11195 and [11C]ketoprofen tracers, non-invasive in vivo 
PET imaging for rheumatoid synovitis can provide diagnostic evidence of early 
synovitis and allow monitoring inflammatory cell activity during treatment.
