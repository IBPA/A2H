AIMS: The Dark-Agouti (DA) rat is very susceptible to pristane-induced arthritis 
(PIA) and represents a suitable model for rheumatoid arthritis. In the present 
study, we examined the pain sensitivity and the effect of local administration 
of octreotide (OCT) on mechanical hyperalgesia in PIA DA rats.
MAIN METHODS: Arthritis was induced by intradermal injection of pristane (300 
microl). The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and heat withdrawal latency 
(HWL) were used to evaluate the pain sensitivity. In addition, we recorded the 
discharge firings in the tibial nerve sensory C-fibers innervating the inflamed 
toe joints of arthritic DA rats.
KEY FINDINGS: Two weeks after injection of pristane, all DA rats developed 
severe arthritis. This symptom was associated with a decreased MWT (78.50+/-5.68 
mN before pristane injection, 19.50+/-6.27 mN on day 14 after pristane 
injection), indicating a mechanical hyperalgesia in PIA. In contrast, HWL was 
comparable before and after pristane injection (10.25+/-0.70 s before injection; 
9.45+/-1.23 s on day 14 after injection). Local injection of OCT markedly 
increased MWT and relieved the hyperalgesia in PIA. In addition, OCT 
significantly decreased the discharge rate of afferent C units evoked by both 
non-noxious and noxious joint movements.
SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the results demonstrate that mechanical 
hyperalgesia, but not thermal hyperalgesia is associated with PIA and that the 
mechanical hyperalgesia and the discharge of afferent C units are attenuated by 
local administration of OCT. These observations provide evidence for a novel 
therapeutic strategy for pain control in rheumatoid arthritis.
