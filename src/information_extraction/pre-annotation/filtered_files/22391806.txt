OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammation of the peripheral joints is a hallmark of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The autoantibody response in RA has been shown to be 
directed mainly to ubiquitous antigens, whereas the response to cartilage 
proteins has been less extensively investigated. This study was undertaken to 
characterize the immune response in pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in the rat 
to the cartilage-specific proteins type II collagen (CII) and type XI collagen 
(CXI) and to genetically fine-map their underlying major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) associations.
METHODS: The genetic control of CII and CXI immunity was mapped using 
intra-MHC-recombinant inbred strains immunized with the respective collagens. 
Reactivity with CII and CXI was tested in acute and chronic PIA and in 356 
HLA-typed patients with recently diagnosed RA.
RESULTS: Mapping of arthritis susceptibility within the MHC region revealed a 
144-223-kb locus containing <12 genes, including paralogs for HLA-DQ and HLA-DR. 
Susceptibility to CII and CXI was linked to haplotypes RT1(av1) (DA) and RT1(f) 
(DA.1F), respectively. After injection of pristane, rats of both strains 
developed weak T cell and IgG responses to CII, but not to CXI. In chronic 
arthritis, however, collagen reactivity was stronger, specific for CXI, and 
restricted to rats with RT1(f) MHC. Among RA patients, 12% exhibited a specific 
IgG response to CXI, 6% to CII, and 6% to both collagens.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a shift in cartilage recognition in early 
and chronic arthritis in the rat, suggesting that CXI autoreactivity contributes 
to the perpetuation of chronic disease. The results provide evidence of the 
importance of joint antigens in arthritis development.
