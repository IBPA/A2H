OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is associated with increased risk of 
fracture in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To elucidate the cause of 
this increased risk, we examined the effects of chronic erosive inflammatory 
arthritis and GC treatment on bone quality, structure, and biomechanical 
properties in a murine model.
METHODS: Mice with established arthritis and expressing human tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNFα) transgene (Tg) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were 
continually treated with GC (prednisolone 5 mg/kg/day via subcutaneous 
controlled-release pellet) or placebo for 14, 28, or 42 days. Microstructure, 
biomechanical properties, chemical composition, and morphology of the tibiae and 
lumbar vertebral bodies were assessed by micro-computed tomography, 
biomechanical testing, Raman spectroscopy, and histology, respectively. Serum 
markers of bone turnover were also determined.
RESULTS: TNF-Tg and GC treatment additively decreased mechanical strength and 
stiffness in both the tibiae and the vertebral bodies. GC treatment in the 
TNF-Tg mice increased the ductility of tibiae under torsional loading. These 
changes were associated with significant alterations in the biochemical and 
structural composition of the mineral and organic components of the bone matrix, 
a decrease in osteoblast activity and bone formation, and an increase in 
osteoclast activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the concomitant decrease in bone strength 
and increase in bone ductility associated with chronic inflammation and GC 
therapy, coupled with the significant changes in the bone quality and structure, 
may increase the susceptibility of the bone to failure under low-energy loading. 
This may explain the mechanism of symptomatic insufficiency fractures in 
patients with RA receiving GC therapy who do not have radiographic 
manifestations of fracture.
