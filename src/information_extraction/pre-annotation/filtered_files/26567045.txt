INTRODUCTION: The endocannabinoid system modulates function of immune cells and 
mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts, which contribute to cartilage destruction 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of the study was to determine the 
influence of N-acylethanolamines anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) 
and oleylethanolamine (OEA) on several features of arthritic inflammation in 
vitro (human material) and in vivo (a mouse model).
METHODS: Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to detect cannabinoid 
receptors and related enzymes. Cytokines and MMP-3 were measured by ELISA. 
Intracellular signaling proteins were detected by proteome profiling. 
Proliferation was quantified by CTB reagent. Adhesion was assessed by the 
xCELLigence system. After onset of collagen type II arthritis, mice were treated 
daily with the FAAH inhibitor JNJ1661010 (20 mg/kg) or vehicle.
RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-3 (determined only in synovial fibroblasts (SFs)) 
were downregulated in primary synoviocytes and SFs of RA and OA after AEA, PEA 
and OEA treatment. In SFs, this was due to activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1 in a 
COX-2-dependent fashion. FAAH inhibition increased the efficacy of AEA in 
primary synoviocytes but not in SFs. The effects of OEA and PEA on SFs were 
diminished by FAAH inhibition. Adhesion to fibronectin was increased in a 
CB1-dependent manner by AEA in OASFs. Furthermore, elevation of endocannabinoids 
ameliorated collagen-induced arthritis in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: N-acylethanolamines exert anti-inflammatory effects in SFs. A dual 
FAAH/COX-2 inhibitor, increasing N-acylethanolamine levels with concomitant TRP 
channel desensitization, might be a good candidate to inhibit the production of 
proinflammatory mediators of synovial cells and to reduce erosions.
