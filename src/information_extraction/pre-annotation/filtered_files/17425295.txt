Presentation of (glyco)peptides by the class II major histocompatibility complex 
molecule Aq to T cells plays a central role in collagen-induced arthritis, an 
animal model for the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. A peptide library 
was designed using statistical molecular design in amino acid space in which 
five positions in the minimal mouse collagen type II binding epitope CII260-267 
were varied. A substantially reduced peptide library of 24 peptides with diverse 
and representative molecular characteristics was selected, synthesized, and 
evaluated for the binding strength to Aq. A multivariate QSAR model was 
established by correlating calculated descriptors, compressed to its principle 
properties, with the binding data using partial least-square regression. The 
model was successfully validated by an external test set. Interpretation of the 
model provided a molecular property binding motif for peptides interacting with 
Aq. The information may be useful in future research directed toward new 
treatments of rheumatoid arthritis.
