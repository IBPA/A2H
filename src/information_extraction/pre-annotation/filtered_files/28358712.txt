BACKGROUND: The Elaeagnus angustifolia fruit has been traditionally used in 
Iranian herbal medicine to treat diarrhea and rheumatoid arthritis. In the 
present study, the effects of E. angustifolia fruit extract on the acute and 
chronic phases of formalin-induced rat paw edema were examined.
METHODS: The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects of E. angustifolia 
fruit extract were investigated through the subcutaneous injection of 100 Î¼L of 
formalin (2.5%) into a rat's hind paw. Thirty minutes before the procedure, the 
experimental groups were treated intraperitoneally with hydroalcoholic fruit 
extracts of E. angustifolia (concentrations of 100, 300, 700, and 1000 mg/kg); 
sodium salicylate (SS, 400 mg/kg) and distilled water were used as positive and 
negative control groups, respectively. Treatment with SS and the fruit extracts 
were performed daily for 8 days, and the degree of edema was measured by using 
mercury plethysmometer and digital caliper.
RESULTS: In the acute anti-inflammatory study, the extract showed a significant 
anti-inflammatory effect in a dose-dependent manner. The results of 1000 mg/kg 
of the extract was significantly different compared with the negative control 
group (p<0.05) and was comparable to sodium salicylate (p<0.05). Results from 
the chronic study suggested that E. angustifolia extract significantly reduced 
paw edema and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The results also showed 
that the measurement by digital caliper and mercury plethysmometer were both 
reliable and might be applied interchangeably (p<0.01). Phytochemical tests 
indicated that the hydroalcoholic fruit extract of E. angustifolia was positive 
for cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, terpenoids, and saponins.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, the E. angustifolia fruit extract probably 
has acute and chronic anti-inflammatory activities to support its applications 
in folk medicine.
