Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease associated with painful joints that affects 
approximately 1% of the population worldwide, and for which no effective cure is 
available. It is characterized by chronic joint inflammation and variable 
degrees of bone and cartilage erosion. Oxygen metabolism has an important role 
in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are 
produced in many normal and abnormal processes in humans, including atheroma, 
asthma, joint diseases, aging, and cancer. TNF-alpha overproduction is thought 
to be the main contributor to increased ROS release in patients with RA. 
Increased ROS production leads to tissue damage associated with inflammation. 
The prevailing hypothesis that ROS promote inflammation was recently challenged 
when polymorphisms in Neutrophil cytosolic factor 1(Ncf1), that decrease 
oxidative burst, were shown to increase disease severity in mouse and rat 
arthritis models. It has been shown that oxygen radicals might also be important 
in controlling disease severity and reducing joint inflammation and connective 
tissue damage. In this review article, our aim is to clarify the role of ROS in 
immunopathogenesis of Rheumatoid arthritis.
