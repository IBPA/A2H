Jeevaneeya rasayana is an ayurvedic polyherbal formulation, with antirheumatic 
potential. The present study investigates the therapeutic efficacy of isolated 
total alkaloid fraction of Jeevaneeya Rasayana (AJR) in treating rheumatoid 
arthritis in a rat model of Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). Paw swelling, 
inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), expression of 
cytokines and serum nitric oxide (NO) level were analyzed in experimental rats 
after an experimental period of 21 days. Arthritic induction significantly 
increased paw edema, and up regulated the inflammatory mediators and cytokines. 
Administration of AJR significantly reversed the paw edema, reduced the level of 
PGE2, serum NO and decreased the COX-2 activity in the paw tissue. AJR treatment 
also downregulated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MMP-9 in paw tissue. HPTLC analysis 
revealed the presence of 5 different alkaloid compounds in AJR. These findings 
suggest that the AJR have the therapeutic potential against adjuvant-induced 
arthritis.
