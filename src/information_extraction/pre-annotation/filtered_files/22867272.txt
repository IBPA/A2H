Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in the rat is used as a model for rheumatoid 
arthritis. In AA rats, the pharmacokinetics of various drugs is affected due to 
the alterations of plasma protein binding of drugs. We choose propranolol (PL) 
and flurbiprofen (FP) as model basic and acidic drugs, respectively, and 
investigated the effect of AA induction on their plasma protein binding at each 
developing stage of inflammation. The plasma protein binding of PL and FP was 
dramatically changed due to reduced albumin and increased α₁-acid glycoprotein 
levels for at least 21 days after adjuvant treatment. Moreover, we illustrated 
the differences in protein binding in AA between both the drugs in each 
developing stage of inflammation. These results suggest that the changed plasma 
protein levels in AA rats accompanying the altered protein binding of drugs 
affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs which extensively bind to plasma protein 
under inflammatory condition.
