Autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins (ACPAs) are present in two-thirds of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ACPAs are produced in the absence of 
identified T cell responses for each citrullinated protein. Peptidyl arginine 
deiminase 4 (PAD4), which binds proteins and citrullinates them, is the target 
of autoantibodies in early RA. This suggests a model for the emergence of ACPAs 
in the absence of detectable T cells specific for citrullinated antigens: ACPAs 
could arise because PADs are recognized by T cells, which help the production of 
autoantibodies to proteins bound by PADs, according to a "hapten/carrier" model. 
Here, we tested this model in normal mice. C3H are healthy mice whose IEβk chain 
is highly homologous to the β1 chain HLA-DRB1*04:01, the allele most strongly 
associated with RA in humans. C3H mice immunized with PADs developed antibodies 
and T cells to PAD and IgG antibodies to citrullinated fibrinogen peptides, in 
the absence of a T cell response to fibrinogen. To analyze the MHC background 
effect on hapten/carrier immunization, we immunized DBA/2 mice (whose IEβd chain 
is similar to that of HLA-DRB1*04:02, an HLA-DR4 subtype not associated with 
RA). DBA/2 mice failed to develop antibodies to citrullinated fibrinogen 
peptides. Thus, T cell immunization to PAD proteins may trigger ACPAs through a 
hapten/carrier mechanism. This may constitute the basis for a new mouse model of 
ACPA-positive RA.
