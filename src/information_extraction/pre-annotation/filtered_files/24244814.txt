This study examined the effects of calcium (Ca) gluconate on collagen-induced 
DBA mouse rheumatoid arthritis (CIA). A single daily dose of 200, 100 or 50 
mg/kg Ca gluconate was administered orally to male DBA/1J mice for 40 days after 
initial collagen immunization. To ascertain the effects administering the 
collagen booster, CIA-related features (including body weight, poly-arthritis, 
knee and paw thickness, and paw weight increase) were measured from 
histopathological changes in the spleen, left popliteal lymph node, third digit 
and the knee joint regions. CIA-related bone and cartilage damage improved 
significantly in the Ca gluconate- administered CIA mice. Additionally, 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in the paw were reduced in Ca gluconate-treated CIA 
mice compared to CIA control groups. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA), an 
indicator of oxidative stress, decreased in a dosedependent manner in the Ca 
gluconate group. Finally, the production of IL-6 and TNF-Î±, involved in 
rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, were suppressed by treatment with Ca 
gluconate. Taken together, these results suggest that Ca gluconate is a 
promising candidate anti-rheumatoid arthritis agent, exerting anti-inflammatory, 
anti-oxidative and immunomodulatory effects in CIA mice.
