BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The balance between T helper 17 (Th17) cells and 
regulatory T (Treg) cells, plays a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
The differentiation of Th17 cells requires the activation of STAT3, which 
determines the balance of Th17/Treg. Here, we investigated the therapeutic 
effect of Cryptotanshinone (CTS) on collagen induced mouse arthritis and 
explored the underlying mechanisms.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Arthritis was induced in DBA/1 mice with bovine collagen 
type II and complete Freund's adjuvant. CTS was given at 20mgkg-1d-1 or 
60mgkg-1d-1 by gavage for 6weeks. The immuno-inflammation and joint destruction 
were evaluated and the balance of Th17/Treg was determined. STAT3 acetylation 
and phosphorylation were detected by western blotting, and the involvement of 
p300 was investigated by siRNA and plasmid overexpression.
KEY RESULTS: CTS at a dose of 60mgkg-1d-1 ameliorated the inflammation and joint 
destruction in CIA mice. It improved Th17/Treg imbalance, and inhibited both 
acetylation and phosphorylation of STAT3. CTS reduced p300 expression and its 
binding to STAT3, but increased phosphorylated AMPK. Knockdown of p300 mimicked 
the inhibitory effect of CTS on STAT3 acetylation and phosphorylation, which 
could be partially rescued by overexpression of p300-WT, but not p300-dominant 
negative (DN) construct.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggested that the anti-arthritis effects 
of CTS were attained through suppression of p300-mediated STAT3 acetylation. Our 
data suggest that CTS might be a potential immune modulator for RA treatment.
