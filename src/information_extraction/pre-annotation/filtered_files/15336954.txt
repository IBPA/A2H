Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) antibody in combination with 
methotrexate dramatically decreases joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. 
The aim of this study was to examine combined treatment with 
N-[1-(4-([4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]methyl)phenyl)cyclopropyl] acetamide 
HCl (Y-40138) and methotrexate in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis. The increase 
in hindpaw volume and joint destruction was suppressed by single therapeutic 
administration (days 15-20) of Y-40138 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), but not by prophylactic 
administration (days 1-9). However, arthritic progression was suppressed by 
single prophylactic administration of methotrexate (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.), but not by 
therapeutic administration. Combined administration (days 10-20) of Y-40138 
(0.3-1 mg/kg) and methotrexate (0.03 mg/kg) synergistically suppressed the 
increase in hindpaw volume and joint destruction. We concluded that Y-40138 in 
combination with methotrexate synergistically suppressed arthritic progression. 
These data suggest that combined treatment with Y-40138 and methotrexate may 
increase efficacy of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.
