The regulation of angiogenesis is an interesting area to consider for novel 
therapeutic approaches to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chemically modified 
heparins have been developed as possible candidates for angiogenesis inhibitor; 
however, they have a major clinical drawback in exhibiting poor oral 
bioavailability. Here, orally absorbable O-desulfated low molecular weight 
heparin (ODS-LMWH) derivatives were newly synthesized by conjugating 2-O- or 
6-O-desulfated LMWH with deoxycholic acid (DOCA) or bisDOCA (a dimer of DOCA), 
and their physicochemical properties, antiangiogenic potency and pharmacokinetic 
profiles were assessed. After selecting the best candidate among those 
derivatives, its therapeutic efficacy on arthritis was investigated in a murine 
collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model. ODS-LMWH derivatives 
significantly inhibited the capillary-like tube formation of human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF)-induced angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assay. Among all the compounds, 
6ODS-LHbD showed the highest oral bioavailability in rats (19.3%). In the CAIA 
mouse model, 6ODS-LHbD (10 mg/kg, p.o., S.I.D.) significantly inhibited 
neovascularization in the joint, the increase of hind-paw thickness, and the 
structural damage in the bone. Therefore, 6ODS-LHbD would be a promising 
candidate for an orally active drug for the treatment of RA.
