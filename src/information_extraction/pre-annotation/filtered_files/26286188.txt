PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of N-(2-hydroxypropyl) 
methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-dexamethasone conjugate (P-Dex) in the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
METHODS: HPMA copolymer labeled with a near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dye was 
administered to mice with CIA to validate its passive targeting to inflamed 
joints and utility as a drug carrier system. The CIA mice were treated with 
P-Dex, dexamethasone (Dex) or saline and the therapeutic efficacy and skeletal 
toxicity evaluated using clinical scoring and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT).
RESULTS: The NIRF signal of the HPMA copolymer localized to arthritic joints 
consistent with its passive targeting to sites of inflammation. While the CIA 
mice responded more rapidly to P-Dex compared to Dex, the final clinical score 
and endpoint μ-CT analyses of localized bone erosions indicated that both single 
dose P-Dex and dose equivalent daily Dex led to comparable clinical efficacy 
after 30 days. μ-CT analysis of the proximal tibial metaphyses showed that P-Dex 
treatment was associated with significantly higher BMD and BV/TV compared to Dex 
and the saline control, consistent with reduced glucocorticoid (GC) skeletal 
toxicity.
CONCLUSION: These results validate the therapeutic efficacy of P-Dex in the CIA 
mouse model. P-Dex treatment averted the adverse effects of GC's on systemic 
bone loss, supporting its utility in clinical development for the management of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
