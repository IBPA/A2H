Sphingolipids (SPLs) are biologically important molecules, but the structural 
diversity and complexity of SPLs brings significant analytical challenges for 
their study. In this paper, we have developed an UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based 
sphingolipidomic approach for the comprehensive identification and 
quantification of SPLs in rat serum. A total of 120 SPLs covering seven 
subcategories were identified for the first time. Method validations including 
linearity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and recovery were also evaluated. This 
method was exemplarily applied to characterize the SPL alterations in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) rats and the intervention effects of indomethacin (IDM). Partial 
least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that the model group was 
well separated from the control group, whereas the IDM-treated group exhibited a 
trend to recover the controls. Twenty-six significantly changed SPL markers were 
explored, and the levels of ceramides (Cers) and their metabolites were found to 
be reversed by IDM treatment. These results indicate that IDM exerts 
anti-arthritic effects through the suppression of Cer-mediated COX-2 activation 
and resulting PEGâ‚‚ liberation. The present study demonstrates a promising 
potential of this method for the understanding of RA and the anti-arthritic 
mechanisms of relevant drugs.
