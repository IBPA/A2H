Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used model for rheumatoid 
arthritis. Induction of CIA in rats using rat type II collagen (CII) results in 
a chronic arthritis in which anti-CII antibodies are believed to play a 
pathogenic role. In this study, we analyzed the epitope selection and V gene 
usage in the anti-CII response in the DA rat. A panel of CII-reactive B cell 
hybridomas was established from the draining lymph nodes 11 days after 
immunization. All of the CII-specific antibodies bound cartilage in vivo, 
showing that these are true autoantibodies. These antibodies were all IgG and 
specific for several distinct triple helical epitopes on CII. Interestingly, the 
major epitope, recognized by four different antibodies, was identical with the 
major B cell epitope in the mouse CII located at position 359--369 (denoted as 
C1(III)). The Q52 and PC7183 V(H) gene families encoded 12 out of 14 sequenced 
heavy chains. There was a relatively more heterogeneous usage of V(L) genes as 
the antibodies were encoded by four different V(kappa) families (V(kappa)1, 
V(kappa)2, V(kappa)12/13 and V(kappa)RF). As in the mouse, some of the V genes 
used showed germline characteristics. We conclude that the immune response in 
the rat shares epitope specificity and a constrained V gene repertoire with the 
mouse. However, the V genes used for recognition of the closely related collagen 
structures differed considerably between mouse and rat, indicating an influence 
of the species-specific variation in the V gene repertoire.
