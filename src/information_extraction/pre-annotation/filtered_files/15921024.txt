Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that is still insufficiently controlled 
by current treatments. Methotrexate (M7X), a small molecular weight compound, 
has been the gold standard in the treatment of RA. It has several 
anti-inflammatory activities, but their contribution to its antiarthritic 
effects has not yet been established. We conducted a rat adjuvant arthritis 
study, in which we investigated the effect of MTX on local cytokine and 
chemokine production in arthritic paws. Our data demonstrate that MTX was able 
to significantly suppress cytokine and chemokine release in the inflamed joints 
in a dose-dependent fashion, accompanied by amelioration of the disease as 
indicated by reduced paw swelling and arthritic scores. These findings prompt 
further studies to clarify whether these suppressive effects of MTX on local 
cytokine and chemokine release are direct or whether they are a result of other 
preceding anti-inflammatory activities of the compound.
