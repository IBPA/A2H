This study was designed to explore the underlying mechanism of p-coumaric acid 
(CA), a dietary polyphenol in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model with 
reference to synovitis and osteoclastogenesis. Celecoxib (COX-2 selective 
inhibitor) (5 mg/kg b.wt) was used as a reference drug. CA remarkably suppressed 
the paw edema, body weight loss and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels 
(TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) in serum and ankle joint of arthritic rats. 
Consistently, CA reduced the expression of osteoclastogenic factors (RANKL and 
TRAP), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17), and 
inflammatory enzymes (iNOS and COX-2) in arthritic rats. However, OPG expression 
was found elevated. Besides, the abundance of transcription factors (NF-κB-p65, 
and p-NF-κB-p65, NFATc-1, and c-Fos) and MAP kinases (JNK, p-JNK, and ERK1/2) 
expression was alleviated in CA administered arthritic rats. In addition, CA 
truncated osteoclastogenesis by regulating the RANKL/OPG imbalance in arthritic 
rats and suppressing the RANKL-induced NFATc-1 and c-Fos expression in vitro. 
Radiological (CT and DEXA scan) and histological assessments authenticated that 
CA inhibited TRAP, bone destruction and cartilage degradation in association 
with enhanced bone mineral density. Taken together, our findings suggest that CA 
demonstrated promising anti-arthritic effect and could prove useful as an 
alternative drug in RA therapeutics. © 2017 BioFactors, 43(5):698-717, 2017.
