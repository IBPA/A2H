Diagnosis of cartilage damage in early stages of arthritis is vital to impede 
the progression of disease. In this regard, considerable progress has been made 
in near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) optical imaging technique. Arthritis can 
develop due to various mechanisms but one of the main contributors is the 
production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that can degrade 
components of the extracellular matrix. Especially, MMP-1 and MMP-13 have main 
roles in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis because they enhance collagen 
degradation in the process of arthritis. We present here a novel NIRF imaging 
strategy that can be used to determine the activity of MMPs and cartilage damage 
simultaneously by detection of exposed type II collagen in cartilage tissue. In 
this study, retro-orbital injection of mixed fluorescent dyes, MMPSense 750 FAST 
(MMP750) dye and Alexa Fluor 680 conjugated monoclonal mouse antibody 
immune-reactive to type II collagen, was administered in the arthritic mice. 
Both dyes were detected with different intensity according to degree of joint 
destruction in the animal. Thus, our dual fluorescence imaging method can be 
used to detect cartilage damage as well as MMP activity simultaneously in early 
stage arthritis.
