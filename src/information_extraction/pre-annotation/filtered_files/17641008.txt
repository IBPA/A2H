The view on reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflammation is currently shifting 
from being considered damaging toward having a more complex role in regulating 
inflammatory reactions. We recently demonstrated a role of ROS in regulation of 
animal models for the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. Low levels of ROS 
production, due to a mutation in the Ncf1 gene coding for the Ncf1 (alias 
p47(phox)) subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex, was shown to be associated with 
increased autoimmunity and arthritis severity in both rats and mice. To further 
investigate the role of ROS in autoimmunity, we studied transgenic mice 
expressing collagen type II (CII) with a mutation (D266E) in the immunodominant 
epitope that mimics the rat and human CII (i.e., mutated mouse collagen or MMC). 
This mutation results in a stronger binding of the epitope to the MHC class II 
molecule and leads to more pronounced tolerance and resistance to arthritis 
induced with rat CII. When the Ncf1 mutation was bred into these mice, tolerance 
was broken, resulting in enhanced T cell autoreactivity, high titers of anti-CII 
Abs, and development of severe arthritis. These findings highlight the 
importance of a sufficient ROS production in maintenance of tolerance to 
self-Ags, a central mechanism in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. This is important as we, for the first time, can follow the effect of 
ROS on molecular mechanisms where T cells are responsible for either protection 
or promotion of arthritis depending on the level of oxygen species produced.
