In this study, injectable microspheres were developed for the local treatment of 
joint degeneration in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Microspheres loaded with 
triamcinolone (TA), a corticosteroid drug, and/or raloxifene (Ral), a cartilage 
regenerative drug, were prepared with a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer, 
polycaprolactone (PCL). Microspheres were optimized for particle size, 
structural properties, drug release, and loading properties. In vitro release of 
Ral was very slow because of the low solubility of the drug and hydrophobic 
nature of PCL. However, when coloaded with TA, both drugs were released at 
higher amounts compared with their single forms. Smallest particle sizes were 
obtained in dual drug-loaded microspheres. In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed 
biocompatibility of microspheres. In vivo bioefficacy of these microspheres was 
also examined in adjuvant-induced arthritis model in rats. In vivo histological 
studies of control groups showed development of RA with high median lesion score 
(5.0). Compared with control and intra-articular free drug injections, 
microsphere treatment groups showed lower lesion scores and better healing 
outcomes in histological evaluations. Results suggest that a controlled delivery 
system of TA and RAL by a single injection in inflamed joints holds promise for 
healing and suppressing inflammation.
