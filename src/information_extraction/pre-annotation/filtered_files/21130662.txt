Near-infrared fluorophore (NIRF)-labeled imaging probes are becoming 
increasingly important in bio-molecular imaging applications, that is, in animal 
models for tumor imaging or inflammation studies. In this study we showed that 
the previously introduced chemical concept of 'Reverse Design' represents an 
efficient strategy for the generation of selective probes for cysteine proteases 
from chemically optimized protease inhibitors for investigations in proteomic 
lysates as well as for in vivo molecular imaging studies. The newly developed 
activity-based probe AW-091 was demonstrated to be highly selective for 
cathepsin S in vitro and proved useful in monitoring cysteine cathepsin activity 
in vivo, that is, in zymosan-induced mouse model of inflammation. AW-091 showed 
higher signal-to-background ratios at earlier time points than the commercially 
available polymer-based ProSense680 (VisEn Medical) and thus represents an 
efficient new tool for studying early proteolytic processes leading to various 
diseases, including inflammation, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, 
the fluorescent signal originating from the cleaved AW-091 was shown to be 
reduced by the administration of an anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone and by 
the cathepsin inhibitor E-64, providing a valuable system for the evaluation of 
small-molecule inhibitors of cathepsins.
