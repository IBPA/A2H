The glycosylation status of IgG has been implicated in the pathology of 
rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier, we reported the identification of a novel 
secreted endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoS), secreted by Streptococcus 
pyogenes that specifically hydrolyzes the beta-1,4-di-N-acetylchitobiose core of 
the asparagine-linked glycan of human IgG. Here, we analyzed the 
arthritogenicity of EndoS-treated collagen type II (CII)-specific mouse mAb in 
vivo. Endoglycosidase treatment of the antibodies inhibited the induction of 
arthritis in (BALB/c x B10.Q) F1 mice and induced a milder arthritis in B10.RIII 
mice as compared with the severe arthritis induced by non-treated antibodies. 
Furthermore, EndoS treatment did not affect the binding of IgG to CII and their 
ability to activate complement, but it resulted in reduced IgG binding to 
FcgammaR and disturbed the formation of stable immune complexes. Hence, the 
asparagine-linked glycan on IgG plays a crucial role in the development of 
arthritis.
