The effect of N-benzoyl-D-phenylalanine (NBDP) and metformin on neonatal 
streptozotocin (nSTZ) induced diabetes has been studied on plasma and tissue 
glycoproteins. In some pathological conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid 
arthritis and diabetes, there is an abnormal glycosylation of acute phase serum 
proteins. As most serum proteins are produced in the liver, we have examined 
glycoprotein metabolism in diabetic condition. To induce non-insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) a single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg body 
weight) was injected into two day old rats. After 10-12 weeks, rats weighing 
above 150 g were selected for NIDDM model. In these rat, blood glucose and 
plasma glycoproteins were significantly increased whereas plasma insulin was 
significantly decreased. There was a significant decrease in the level of sialic 
acid and elevated levels of hexose, hexosamine and fucose in tissues. Oral 
administration of NBDP and metformin to diabetic rats decreased blood glucose 
and plasma glycoproteins. Plasma insulin and tissue sialic acid were increased 
whereas tissue concentrations of hexose, hexosamine and fucose were near normal. 
Our study suggests that NBDP and metformin possess a significant beneficial 
effect on glycoproteins in addition to their antidiabetic effect.
