Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (PTPN22) represents a strong 
susceptibility gene which is shared by many autoimmune diseases. Exploring the 
mechanism behind this association could help to understand their pathogenesis as 
well as to identify novel therapeutical targets. Recently, multiple mouse models 
including knock-out, knock-in, knock-down and transgenic mice were generated to 
delineate PTPN22s function in this context. Depending on the genetic background, 
mouse PTPN22_619W mutation results in spontaneous autoimmunity, essentially 
replicating the risk effect of the PTPN22_620W in human autoimmune diseases. 
Furthermore, findings from mouse models shed new light on both cellular as well 
as molecular mechanisms of the effect of PTPN22 on adaptive and innate immunity. 
Here we review recently emerged evidence of the interconnection between mouse 
PTPN22 and autoimmunity. We also discuss the consistence and discrepancy between 
findings derived from human and mouse studies.
