Suramin, a polysulfonated polyaromatic symmetrical urea is known for multiple 
therapeutic effects including antineoplastic activity. It is known as an 
antagonist of ATP at P2X purinergic receptors. Suramin is also found to inhibit 
protein synthesis affecting both initiation and elongation of the polypeptide 
chain. As a growth factor blocker, it is reported to suppress experimental 
myocardial inflammation. Here, we describe the anti-arthritic property of 
suramin in the collagen induced arthritic (CIA) rat, a model of human rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of suramin (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 
weeks was found to reduce inflammation and repair joint destruction in CIA rats. 
Recovery of body weight (p<0.0001), reduction in splenic (p<0.05) and arthritic 
indices (p<0.0001) and reappearance of smooth synovial lining after suramin 
treatment to CIA rats were found to be significant. Levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in plasma and joint extracts were 
reduced (p<0.0001) significantly in response to suramin treatment. Several acute 
phase proteins were normalized after suramin administration.
