Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan intestinal parasite, is the causative agent 
of human amebiasis. Amebiasis is the fourth leading cause of death and the third 
leading cause of morbidity due to protozoan infections worldwide(1), resulting 
in ~70,000 deaths annually. E. histolytica has been listed by the National 
Institutes of Health as a category B priority biodefense pathogen in the United 
States. Treatment relies on metronidazole(2), which has adverse effects(3), and 
potential resistance of E. histolytica to the drug is an increasing 
concern(4,5). To facilitate drug screening for this anaerobic protozoan, we 
developed and validated an automated, high-throughput screen (HTS). This screen 
identified auranofin, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used 
therapeutically for rheumatoid arthritis, as active against E. histolytica in 
culture. Auranofin was ten times more potent against E. histolytica than 
metronidazole. Transcriptional profiling and thioredoxin reductase assays 
suggested that auranofin targets the E. histolytica thioredoxin reductase, 
preventing the reduction of thioredoxin and enhancing sensitivity of 
trophozoites to reactive oxygen-mediated killing. In a mouse model of amebic 
colitis and a hamster model of amebic liver abscess, oral auranofin markedly 
decreased the number of parasites, the detrimental host inflammatory response 
and hepatic damage. This new use of auranofin represents a promising therapy for 
amebiasis, and the drug has been granted orphan-drug status from the FDA.
