Tacrolimus (FK506) has been used as a therapeutic drug beneficial for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in humans. In this study, we investigated the 
effects of FK506 on cellular differentiation in cultured chondrogenic cells. 
Culture with FK506 led to a significant and concentration-dependent increase in 
Alcian blue staining for matrix proteoglycan at 0.1 to 1,000 ng/ml, but not in 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, in ATDC5 cells, a mouse pre-chondrogenic 
cell line, cultured for 7 to 28 days, while the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug indomethacin significantly decreased Alcian blue staining in a 
concentration-dependent manner, without altering ALP activity. FK506 
significantly increased the expression of mRNA for both type II and type X 
collagen, but not for osteopontin, in ATDC5 cells. Similar promotion was seen in 
chondrogenic differentiation in both mouse metatarsals and chondrocytes cultured 
with FK506. However, FK506 failed to significantly affect transcriptional 
activity of the reporter construct for either sry-type HMG box 9 (Sox9) or 
runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), which are both transcription 
factors responsible for chondrocytic maturation as a master regulator. These 
results suggest that FK506 may predominantly promote cellular differentiation 
into proliferating chondrocytes through a mechanism not relevant to the 
transactivation by either Sox9 or Runx2 in chondrogenic cells.
