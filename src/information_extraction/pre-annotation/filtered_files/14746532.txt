Rituximab (Rituxan) is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets 
the B-cell CD20 antigen and causes rapid and specific B-cell depletion. 
Rituximab was approved in the United States in 1997 to treat low-grade or 
follicular, relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
(NHL). Since then, further clinical experience with rituximab has been 
incorporated into the prescribing information, which now stipulates an extended 
eight-week schedule, treatment of patients with refractory or relapsed bulky 
disease measuring >10 cm, and retreatment of patients who responded to rituximab 
previously. In 1998, the European Union approved rituximab (MabThera) to treat 
stage III/IV, follicular, chemotherapy-resistant, or relapsed NHL. Recently, the 
European Union also approved the use of rituximab in combination with standard 
chemotherapy for aggressive NHL. Many clinical trials have evaluated rituximab, 
alone or with other therapies, in indolent and aggressive NHL as well as other 
B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. New studies are evaluating rituximab's 
role in first-line therapy, maintenance therapy, and stem-cell transplantation 
procedures. The use of rituximab against autoimmune disorders, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis, is also under 
investigation.
