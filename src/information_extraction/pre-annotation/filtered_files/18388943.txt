Collagen-induced arthritis is a well-validated, but strain-dependent mouse model 
of rheumatoid arthritis, with H-2(q) and H-2(r) strains showing the greatest 
degree of susceptibility. This protocol describes the induction of arthritis in 
the C57BL/6 strain (H-2(b)), which forms the genetic background of the majority 
of genetically modified strains. This protocol involves purification of type II 
collagen from chicken sternums, immunization of mice, clinical assessment of 
arthritis and analysis of T- and B-cell responses to type II collagen. Key 
aspects of the protocol are the need to use chicken collagen for immunization 
and the importance of avoiding aggressive behavior in males. The incidence of 
arthritis varies from 50 to 80% and is milder than the classical 
collagen-induced arthritis model. This procedure takes approximately 3 months to 
complete.
