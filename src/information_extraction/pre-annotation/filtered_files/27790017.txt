OBJECTIVE: Monocyte (MN) recruitment is an essential inflammatory component of 
many autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study we 
investigated the ability of 2-fucosyllactose (H-2g), a glucose analog of blood 
group H antigen to induce MN migration in vivo and determined if H-2g-induced 
interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) plays a role in MN ingress in RA.
METHODS: Sponge granuloma and intravital microscopy assays were performed to 
examine H-2g-induced in vivo MN migration and rolling, respectively. MNs were 
stimulated with H-2g, and the production of IL-8/CXCL8 was assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
Lastly, in vitro MN migration assays and an in vivo RA synovial tissue severe 
combined immunodeficiency mouse model were used to determine the role of 
IL-8/CXCL8 in H-2g-induced MN migration.
RESULTS: In vivo, H-2g induced significantly greater MN migration compared to 
phosphate buffered saline. Intravital microscopy revealed that H-2g mediates MN 
migration in vivo by inducing MN rolling. In addition, H-2g induced MN 
production of IL-8/CXCL8, a process that was dependent on Src kinase. Moreover, 
we found that H-2g mediated MN migration in vitro, and in vivo migration was 
inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-8/CXCL8 antibody.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that H-2g mediates MN recruitment in vitro 
and in vivo (in part) via IL-8/CXCL8.
