1. Rheumatoid arthritis reduces verapamil oral clearance thereby increases 
plasma concentration of the drug. This coincides with reduced drug effects 
through an unknown mechanism. 2. The effect of interferon-induced acute 
inflammation on the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiogram of verapamil (20 mg 
kg(-1), p.o.) and nifedipine (0.1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was studied in Sprague-Dawley 
rats. 3. The effect of both acute and chronic inflammation on radioligand 
binding to cardiac L-type calcium channels was also investigated. 4. Acute 
inflammation resulted in increased plasma concentration of verapamil but had no 
effect on that of nifedipine. Verapamil binding to plasma proteins was 
unaffected. 5. As has been reported for humans, the increased verapamil 
concentration coincided with a reduction in the degree to which PR interval is 
prolonged by the drug. The effect of nifedipine on PR interval was also reduced 
by inflammation. 6. Maximum binding of (3)H-nitrendipine to cardiac cell 
membrane was significantly reduced from 63.2+/-2.5 fmol mg(-1) protein in 
controls to 46.4+/-2.0 in acute inflammation and from 66.8+/-2.2 fmol mg(-1) 
protein in controls to 42.2+/-2.0 in chronic inflammation. 7. Incubation of the 
normal cardiac cell membranes with 100 and 1000 pg ml(-1) of rat tissue necrosis 
factor-alpha did not influence the binding indices to the calcium channels. 8. 
Our data suggest that the reduced calcium channel responsiveness is because of 
altered binding to channels.
