BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease marked by 
intra-articular decreases in pH, aberrant hyaluronan regulation and destruction 
of bone and cartilage. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are the primary acid 
sensors in the nervous system, particularly in sensory neurons and are important 
in nociception. ASIC3 was recently discovered in synoviocytes, non-neuronal 
joint cells critical to the inflammatory process.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of ASIC3 in joint tissue, specifically the 
relationship between ASIC3 and hyaluronan and the response to decreased pH.
METHODS: Histochemical methods were used to compare morphology, hyaluronan 
expression and ASIC3 expression in ASIC3+/+ and ASIC3-/- mouse knee joints. 
Isolated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were used to examine hyaluronan 
release and intracellular calcium in response to decreases in pH.
RESULTS: In tissue sections from ASIC3+/+ mice, ASIC3 localised to articular 
cartilage, growth plate, meniscus and type B synoviocytes. In cultured FLS, 
ASIC3 mRNA and protein was also expressed. In FLS cultures, pH 5.5 increased 
hyaluronan release in ASIC3+/+ FLS, but not ASIC3-/- FLS. In FLS from ASIC3+/+ 
mice, approximately 50% of cells (25/53) increased intracellular calcium while 
only 24% (14/59) showed an increase in ASIC3-/- FLS. Of the cells that responded 
to pH 5.5, there was significantly less intracellular calcium increases in 
ASIC3-/- FLS compared to ASIC3+/+ FLS.
CONCLUSION: ASIC3 may serve as a pH sensor in synoviocytes and be important for 
modulation of expression of hyaluronan within joint tissue.
