Citrullination (deimination is an enzymatic, posttranslational conversion of 
arginine residues to citrulline residues) of joint-associated self-proteins may 
be a possible mechanism in the induction of autoimmune CD4 T-cell responses in 
rheumatoid arthritis. We have studied the immune response to normal or 
deiminated human fibrinogen (hFBG) in mouse strains expressing major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens similar to either 
RA-susceptible or non-susceptible HLA-DR4 alleles. Upon immunization with 
deiminated hFBG, all mouse strains analysed produced high amounts of anti-FBG 
antibodies, while relatively low levels of anti-citrulline antibodies and little 
or no anti-FBG antibodies crossreactive with mouse FBG (mFBG) were obtained. 
Mice immunized with normal hFBG also produced high amounts of anti-hFBG 
antibodies. However, whereas mice with MHC class II molecules similar to 
RA-non-susceptible HLA-DR4 alleles produced low levels of anti-hFBG antibodies 
with crossreactivity to mFBG, mouse strains with RA-susceptible 
HLA-DR4-equivalent MHC class II molecules contained high levels of such 
crossreactive anti-mFBG antibodies. Similar results were obtained with 
HLA-DR4*0401, human CD4-double-transgenic mice. However, none of the more than 
600 mice investigated developed arthritis. These data indicate that the quality 
and/or quantity of anti-FBG autoantibodies or of anti-citrulline antibodies, 
produced in the studied mouse strains, are insufficient to induce arthritis.
