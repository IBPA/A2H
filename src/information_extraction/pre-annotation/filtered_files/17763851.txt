To understand the gender differences noticed in autoimmune disorders, 
particularly rheumatoid arthritis, we used a rat model of collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA). This study was carried out in two parts. In the first study, 
severity of inflammation was compared between male and female rats with respect 
to radiology, histology, activities of lysosomal enzymes, lipid peroxidation, 
immune response to type II collagen and the level of prostaglandin, a major 
inflammatory mediator. Since female rats developed severe inflammation, this 
study was extended to confirm if testosterone at physiological concentration had 
protective effect against CIA. Hence, studies were carried out on the effect of 
testosterone application on castrated arthritic rats. Female arthritic rats were 
also treated with testosterone to find out the effectiveness of the androgen in 
the presence of female hormones. Results of this study conclusively showed that 
testosterone possessed significant anti-inflammatory effects at physiological 
concentration and exerted its action in a gender nonspecific manner.
