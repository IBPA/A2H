Antibodies to type II collagen (collagen II) are pathogenic in experimental 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and possibly also in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Hitherto, results of assays for anti-collagen II have proven to be inconsistent. 
We tested whether mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to collagen II inhibit the 
natural self-assembly of soluble triple-stranded collagen II monomers to form 
insoluble polymeric fibrils. A spectrophotometric assay of self-assembly was 
based on change in absorbance at 313 nm, observed over 0-60 min after 
neutralisation and warming of a solution of monomeric collagen II. Two mAbs to 
collagen II (CII-CI and M2.139) strongly inhibited self-assembly of collagen II 
but not collagen I, whereas another antibody, CII-F4, and an irrelevant control 
mAb did not. Notably, CII-CI and M2.139, but not CII-F4, induce arthritis on 
passive transfer to na√Øve mice. The arthritogenic effects of mAbs CII-CI and 
M2.139 in vivo, and inhibition of collagen II self-assembly in vitro, may be 
attributable to interference with critical epitopes at sites essential for the 
stabilisation of the mature polymeric collagen II fibril, and, hence, the 
integrity of the entire cartilage matrix. This assay for inhibition of 
self-assembly of collagen II could be developed for routine measurement of 
anti-collagen II in body fluids as a marker of early RA, and perhaps also to 
distinguish populations of antibodies to collagen II that either have or lack 
the capacity to perpetuate arthritis.
