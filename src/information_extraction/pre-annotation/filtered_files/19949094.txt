Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune synovitis characterized by the 
presence of anticitrullinated protein Abs, although the exact targets and role 
of anticitrullinated protein autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of RA remain to be 
defined. Fibrinogen, which can be citrullinated, has recently emerged as a 
candidate autoantigen. To determine whether autoimmunity against fibrinogen can 
mediate inflammatory arthritis, we immunized a variety of common mouse strains 
with fibrinogen and found that DBA/1 and SJL mice developed an inflammatory and 
erosive arthritis. Mice with fibrinogen-induced arthritis (FIA) possess 
fibrinogen-reactive T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, 
IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. FIA can be adoptively transferred with either 
plasma or fibrinogen-specific T cells from diseased mice. Mice with FIA possess 
rheumatoid factor, circulating immune complexes, and anticyclic citrullinated 
peptide Abs, all of which are characteristic of human RA. These observations 
demonstrate that fibrinogen is arthritogenic in mice and that the pathogenesis 
of FIA is mediated by both autoantibodies and fibrinogen-reactive T cells.
