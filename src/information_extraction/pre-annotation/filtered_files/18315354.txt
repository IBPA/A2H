Laser-based photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a novel, nonionizing, noninvasive, 
laser-based technology, has been adapted to the diagnosis and imaging of 
inflammatory arthritis. A commonly used adjuvant induced arthritis model using 
carrageenan was employed to simulate acute rheumatoid arthritis in rat tail 
joints. Cross-sectional photoacoustic images of joints affected by acute 
inflammation were compared to those of the control. The diameter of the 
periosteum and the optical absorption of intra-articular tissue were measured on 
each joint image. Significant differences were found on PAT imaging between the 
affected joints and the control for both variables measured, including enlarged 
periosteum diameter and enhanced intra-articular optical absorption occurring in 
the joints affected with carrageenan-induced arthritis. Anatomical correlation 
with histological sections of imaged joints and microMRI results verified the 
findings of PAT. This suggests that PAT has the potential for highly sensitive 
diagnosis and evaluation of pathologic hallmarks of acute inflammatory 
arthritis.
