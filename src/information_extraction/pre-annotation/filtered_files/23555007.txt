Sinomenine (SIN) is a bioactive alkaloid extracted from the Chinese medicinal 
plant Sinomenium acutum, which is widely used in the clinical treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) is 
unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of SIN in lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced ALI in mice. After ALI, lung water content and histological signs 
of pulmonary injury were attenuated, whereas the PaO2/FIO2 (P/F) ratios were 
elevated significantly in the mice pretreated with SIN. Additionally, SIN 
markedly inhibited inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and IL-1β expression levels as 
well as neutrophil infiltration in the lung tissues of the mice. Microarray 
analysis and real-time PCR showed that SIN treatment upregulated adenosine A(2A) 
receptor (A(2A)R) expression, and the protective effect of SIN was abolished in 
A(2A)R knockout mice. Further investigation in isolated mouse neutrophils 
confirmed the upregulation of A(2A)R by SIN and showed that A(2A)R-cAMP-PKA 
signaling was involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of SIN. Taken together, 
these findings demonstrate an A(2A)R-associated anti-inflammatory effect and the 
protective role of SIN in ALI, which suggests a potential novel approach to 
treat ALI.
