BACKGROUND: The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and current biotherapies targeting TNF-alpha have a 
major impact on RA treatment. The long-term safety concerns associated with the 
repetitive TNF blockade prompt optimization of therapeutic anti-TNF approaches. 
Since we recently demonstrated that intra-articular gene transfer using a 
recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (rAAV5) efficiently transduces 
arthritic joints, we evaluate its effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
when encoding TNF antagonists.
METHODS: Recombinant AAV5 vectors encoding the human TNFRp55 extracellular 
domain fused to the Fc region of mice IgG1 (TR1) or a small molecular weight 
dimeric human TNFRp75 extracellular domain (TR2), under two different promoters, 
the CMV or a chimeric NF-kappaB-based promoter inducible by inflammation, were 
injected into mouse CIA joints.
RESULTS: Best protection against arthritis was obtained with the rAAV5 encoding 
the TR1, as reflected by delayed disease onset, decreased incidence and severity 
of joint damage. This effect was associated with a transient expression of the 
anti-TNF agent when expressed under a NF-kappaB-responsive promoter, only 
detectable during disease flare, while the antagonist expression was rapidly 
increased and stable when expressed from a CMV promoter. Importantly, using the 
intra-articular administration of the rAAV5-NF-kappaB-TR1 vector, we observed a 
striking correlation between local TR1 expression and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly support the feasibility of improving the 
safety of anti-TNF approaches for the treatment of arthritis by local 
rAAV5-mediated gene expression under an inflammation-responsive promoter, able 
to provide a limited, transient and therapeutically relevant expression of 
anti-TNF compounds.
