Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key mediator of inflammatory 
diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and anti-TNF-alpha drugs such as 
etanercept are effective treatments. Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) 
are a new class of drugs designed to induce therapeutically favorable splice 
variants of targeted genes. In this work, we used locked nucleic acid 
(LNA)-based SSOs to modulate splicing of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) pre-mRNA. The 
SSO induced skipping of TNFR2 exon 7, which codes the transmembrane domain (TM), 
switching endogenous expression from the membrane-bound, functional form to a 
soluble, secreted form (Delta7TNFR2). This decoy receptor protein accumulated in 
the circulation of treated mice, antagonized TNF-alpha, and altered disease in 
two mouse models: TNF-alpha-induced hepatitis and collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). This is the first report of upregulation of the endogenous, circulating 
TNF-alpha antagonist by oligonucleotide-induced splicing modulation.
