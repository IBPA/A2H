AI (anaemia of inflammation) often manifests in patients with chronic immune 
activation due to cancer, chronic infections, autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid 
arthritis and other diseases. The pathogenesis of AI is complex and involves 
cytokine-mediated inhibition of erythropoiesis, insufficient erythropoietin 
production and diminished sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to this hormone, 
and retention of iron in haemoglobin-processing macrophages. NO (nitric oxide) 
is a gaseous molecule produced by activated macrophages that has been identified 
as having numerous effects on iron metabolism. In the present study, we explore 
the possibility that NO affects iron metabolism in reticulocytes and our results 
suggest that NO may also contribute to AI. We treated reticulocytes with the NO 
donor SNP (sodium nitroprusside). The results indicate that NO inhibits haem 
synthesis dramatically and rapidly at the level of erythroid-specific 
5-aminolaevulinic acid synthase 2, which catalyses the first step of haem 
synthesis in erythroid cells. We also show that NO leads to the inhibition of 
iron uptake via the Tf (transferrin)-Tf receptor pathway. In addition, NO also 
causes an increase in eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) phosphorylation 
levels and decreases globin translation. The profound impairment of haem 
synthesis, iron uptake and globin translation in reticulocytes by NO raises the 
possibility that this gas may also contribute to AI.
