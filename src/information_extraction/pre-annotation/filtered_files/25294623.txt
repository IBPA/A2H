BACKGROUND: Mice and humans produce chitinase-like proteins (CLPs), which are 
highly homologous to chitinases but lack chitinolytic activity. Mice express 
primarily three CLPs, including breast regression protein-39 (BRP-39) [chitinase 
3-like-1 (Chi3l1) or 38-kDa glycoprotein (gp38k)], Ym1 (Chi3l3) and Ym2 
(Chi3l4). Recently, CLPs have attracted considerable attention due to their 
increased expression in a number of pathological conditions, including asthma, 
allergies, rheumatoid arthritis and malignant tumors. Although the exact 
functions of CLPs are largely unknown, the significance of their increased 
expression levels during pathophysiological states needs to be determined. The 
quantification of BRP-39, Ym1 and Ym2 is an important step in gaining insight 
into the in vivo regulation of the CLPs.
METHODS: We constructed a standard DNA for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) by 
containing three CLPs target fragments and five reference genes cDNA in a 
one-to-one ratio. We evaluated this system by analyzing the eight target cDNA 
sequences. Tissue cDNAs obtained by reverse transcription from total RNA from 
four embryonic stages and eight adult tissues were analyzed using the qPCR 
system with the standard DNA.
RESULTS: We established a qPCR system detecting CLPs and comparing their 
expression levels with those of five reference genes using the same scale in 
mouse tissues. We found that BRP-39 and Ym1 were abundant in the mouse lung, 
whereas Ym2 mRNA was abundant in the stomach, followed by lung. The expression 
levels of BRP-39 and Ym1 in the mouse lung were higher than those of two active 
chitinases and were comparable to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a 
housekeeping gene which is constitutively expressed in all tissues.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that catalytically inactive BRP-39 and Ym1 are 
constitutive genes in normal mouse lung.
