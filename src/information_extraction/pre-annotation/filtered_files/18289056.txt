The role of matrix metalloproteinases in disease has been investigated over the 
last two decades. A focus on this family of proteases is particularly emphasized 
in two major arthritides in humans, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Early work described the presence of multiple MMP family members in the joint of 
the disease state and recent advances in the development of new knockout mice 
and disease models have allowed investigators to directly test the role of the 
MMP proteases in arthritis. MMP-13 is expressed by chondrocytes and synovial 
cells in human OA and RA and is thought to play a critical role in cartilage 
destruction. The recent development of an MMP-13 knockout mouse has documented 
the important role for this enzyme in cartilage formation and further studies 
under disease conditions promise to reveal the function of this enzyme in 
disease pathology. This review describes a body of research that supports the 
development of novel selective MMP-13 inhibitors with the hope of developing 
these compounds in clinical trials for the treatment of arthritis.
