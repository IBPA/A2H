Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is expressed abundantly in the rheumatoid 
synovium. In this study, the inflammatory effect of TGF-beta1 in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) was investigated using cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLS) from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, as well as non-arthritic 
individuals. mRNA expressions of IL-1beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, 
IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 
were increased in RA and OA FLS by TGF-beta1 treatment, but not in non-arthritic 
FLS. Enhanced protein expression of IL-1beta, IL-8 and MMP-1 was also observed 
in RA FLS. Moreover, TGF-beta1 showed a synergistic effect in increasing protein 
expression of IL-1beta and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 with TNFalpha and 
IL-1beta, respectively. Biological activity of IL-1 determined by mouse 
thymocyte proliferation assay was also enhanced by 50% in response to TGF-beta1 
in the culture supernatant of RA FLS. DNA binding activities of nuclear factor 
(NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1 were shown to increase by TGF-beta1 as 
well. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 contributes for the progression of 
inflammation and joint destruction in RA, and this effect is specific for the 
arthritic synovial fibroblasts.
