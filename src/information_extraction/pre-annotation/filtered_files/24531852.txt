Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with high morbidity 
and mortality. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in the synovial tissues play 
critical roles in joint destruction. Recent studies implicate the sumoylation in 
the regulation of the inflammation and arthritis. Thus, we explored whether 
SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 is involved in the progression of RA using a mouse 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. The effects of UBC9 siRNA on cell 
invasion and migration in human RA-FLS were also assessed in vitro. Treatment 
with siRNA against UBC9 for 3 weeks reduced the arthritis score and joint 
destruction. The expression of SUMO-1 and UBC9 protein in CIA joints was 
inhibited by UBC9 knockdown. Serum levels of anti-collagen (CII) antibodies, 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMP)-3, and MMP-9 were also decreased in CIA mice. In vitro, UBC9 silencing 
inhibited the secretion of VEGF-A, MMP-3, and MMP-9 from TNF-α-stimulated human 
RA-FLS. TNF-α-induced RA-FLS proliferation and migration were significantly 
attenuated by UBC9 knockdown. These findings indicate that SUMO-conjugating 
enzyme UBC9 promotes proliferation and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
in rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of UBC9 activity may be a viable therapeutic 
target in amelioration of disease progression in RA by attenuating FLS 
proliferation, migration, and invasion.
