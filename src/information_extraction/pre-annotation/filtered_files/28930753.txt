BACKGROUND/AIMS: Camel milk (CM) has shown beneficial anti-inflammatory actions 
in several experimental and clinical settings. So far, its effect on rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) has not been previously explored. Thus, the current work aimed to 
evaluate the effects of CM in Adjuvant-induced arthritis and air pouch edema 
models in rats, which mimic human RA.
METHODS: CM was administered at 10 ml/kg orally for 3 weeks starting on the day 
of Freund's adjuvant paw inoculation. The levels of TNF-α and IL-10 were 
measured by ELISA while the protein expression of NF-κBp65, COX-2 and iNOS was 
detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of MAPK target proteins was 
assessed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: CM attenuated paw edema, arthritic index and gait score along with 
dorsal pouch inflammatory cell migration. CM lowered the TNF-α and augmented the 
anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels in sera and exudates of arthritic rats. It also 
attenuated the expression of activated NF-κBp65, COX-2 and iNOS in the lining of 
the dorsal pouch. Notably, CM inhibited the MAPK pathway signal transduction via 
lowering the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in rat hind paws. 
Additionally, CM administration lowered the lipid peroxide and nitric oxide 
levels and boosted glutathione and total anti-oxidant capacity in sera and 
exudates of animals.
CONCLUSION: The observed CM downregulation of the arthritic process may support 
the interest of CM consumption as an adjunct approach for the management of RA.
