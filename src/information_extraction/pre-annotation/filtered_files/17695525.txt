Antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are clinically 
used for Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. TNF-alpha is also 
an important cytokine in radiotherapy because it mediates inflammatory responses 
in normal tissues. To study the influence of TNF-alpha inhibition on radiation 
toxicity, we used a well-established mouse model of kidney irradiation, where 
the portal also includes parts of the intestine. Mice were treated with 
single-fraction radiotherapy to the right kidney with doses of 8 or 10 Gy with 
or without the monoclonal TNF-alpha antibody infliximab injected i.v. in three 
doses. The kidney function was assessed by means of repeated 
99mTc-dimercaptosuccinate scans during a maximum follow-up of 49 weeks. 
Treatment with infliximab significantly exacerbated radiation nephropathy at all 
time points, both in the 8 Gy and 10 Gy groups. The drug itself is not known to 
cause renal impairment. In the control group irradiated with 10 Gy, one mouse 
died from delayed radiation-induced intestinal toxicity. Skin reactions and 
general performance status were also similar across the groups. These data 
suggest that administration of infliximab concomitant to radiotherapy causes 
profound alterations in the development of kidney dysfunction. Importantly, 
other radiation-related toxicities were similar across all groups.
