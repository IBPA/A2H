The potential therapeutic action of shikonin in an experimental model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was investigated. As a RA animal model, DBA/1J mice 
were immunized two times with type II collagen. After the second collagen 
immunization, mice were orally administered shikonin (2 mg/kg) once a day for 35 
days, and the incidence, clinical score, bone mineral density (BMD), bone 
mineral content (BMC) and joint histopathology were evaluated. BMD in the 
proximal regions of the tibia largely increased in the shikonin treatment group 
compared with the control group. We also examined the effect of shikonin on 
inflammatory cytokines and cartilage protection. Shikonin treatment 
significantly reduced the incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA), markedly abrogating joint swelling and cartilage destruction. Shikonin 
also significantly inhibited the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 
and up-regulated tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in mice with 
CIA. In conclusion, shikonin exerted therapeutic effects through regulation of 
MMP/TIMP; these results suggest that shikonin is an outstanding candidate as a 
cartilage protective medicine for RA.
