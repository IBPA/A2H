OBJECTIVES: Isolation and identification of phytochemicals of Crassula capitella 
(Thunberg), evaluation of the anti-arthritic potential of the extract and the 
major isolated compound; 11-O-(4'-O-methyl galloyl)-bergenin and underlying 
their mechanism on rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Different fractions were subjected to column chromatography giving 
fourteen compound identified by mass and NMR spectroscopic techniques. RA was 
induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the right 
hind paw of rats. Influence of tested samples in comparable to methotrexate on 
paw oedema, body weight gain, serum diagnostic markers, cartilage and bone 
degeneration enzymes, pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress biomarkers 
in arthritic rats.
KEY FINDINGS: Fourteen phenolic compounds were isolated and identified for the 
first time from C.Â capitella. The major compound identified as 11-O-(4'-O-methyl 
galloyl)-bergenin. Treatment of arthritic rats with extract or 11-O-(4'-O-methyl 
galloyl)-bergenin with the tested doses can reduce the progression and severity 
of RA.
CONCLUSION: Crassula capitella is a new natural and abundant source for 
11-O-(4'-O-methyl galloyl)-bergenin for resolving chronic inflammatory diseases 
as RA through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing mechanism.
