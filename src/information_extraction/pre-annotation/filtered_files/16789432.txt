Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of many 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzhemier's disease and is also 
responsible for aging, artherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and 
carcinogenesis. Olefins such as dehydroalanines have been shown to inactivate 
free radicals by forming stabilized free radical adducts. Among these molecules 
N-acyl dehydroalanines react with and scavenge oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. 
This study describes the synthesis, characterization and in vitro effects on rat 
liver lipid peroxidation levels, and DPPH free radical scavenging activities of 
some N-acyl dehydroalanine derivatives. Compounds c, f and j slightly scavenged 
the level of DPPH radical at 10(-3) M concentration by about 27, 46, and 56%, 
respectively while compounds a, d, e, f, g, h showed a strong inhibitory effect 
on lipid peroxidation at 10(-3)M and 10(-4)M concentrations and inhibition was 
in the range of 76-90%. The possible antioxidant mechanism of the compounds was 
discussed.
