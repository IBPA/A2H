The TNF signaling pathway is a valuable target in the therapy of autoimmune 
diseases, and anti-TNF drugs are successfully used to treat diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. By their ability to 
interfere with inflammatory processes at multiple levels, these TNF blockers 
have become invaluable tools to inhibit the inflammation induced damage and 
allow recovery of the affected tissues. Unfortunately this therapy has some 
drawbacks, including increased risk of infection and malignancy, and remarkably, 
the onset of new auto-immune diseases. Some of these effects are caused by the 
unwanted abrogation of beneficial TNF signaling. More specific targeting of the 
pathological TNF-induced signaling might lead to broader applicability and 
improved safety. Specificity might be increased by inhibiting the soluble 
TNF/TNFR1 axis while leaving the often beneficial transmembrane TNF/TNFR2 
signaling untouched. This approach looks promising because it inhibits the 
pathological effects of TNF and reduces the side effects, and it opens the way 
for the treatment of other diseases in which TNFR2 inhibition is detrimental. In 
this review we give an overview of in vivo mouse studies of TNF mediated 
pathologies demonstrating that the blockade or genetic deletion of sTNF or TNFR1 
is preferable over total TNF blockade.
