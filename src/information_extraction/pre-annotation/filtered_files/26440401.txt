Ruta graveolens (Rue) is a well-known medicinal plant having anti-inflammatory 
and other healing properties. This contains many active phytochemicals such as 
coumarins which possess anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. The 
present study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a newly 
isolated coumarin derivative from rue plant, 8-methoxy-chromen-2-one (MCO) in 
the collagen induced arthritic (CIA) rat model. MCO showed inhibition of 
cytokines and NF-κB in LPS stimulated J774 cells which prompted its possible use 
in animal. In CIA, arthritic index and arthritic score reduced markedly within 
15days of MCO treatment at doses of 2mg and 20mg per kg body weight. Alleviation 
of joint damage in CIA animals on treatment with MCO was evident from 
radiographic and histological data. Behavioral studies by open field tests also 
showed convalescence in the MCO treated CIA rats. Further, escalated plasma 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and also nitric 
oxide reduced significantly with the treatment. All these results indicate the 
therapeutic efficacy of MCO and its possible use as an anti-arthritic drug.
