The aim of this study was to obtain biodegradable indomethacin microspheres for 
intra-articular administration in rheumatoid arthritis, where angiogenic 
processes are involved. Indomethacin concentrations to achieve an 
anti-angiogenic effect would be five-times higher than an anti-inflammatory. 
Microspheres were prepared by solvent evaporation using PLGA. Indomethacin is a 
poor water-soluble drug with it being possible that dissolved and non-dissolved 
drug co-exist within the polymeric matrix resulting in rapid release. To control 
this release, an oil-PEG-derivative was incorporated, producing changes in 
morphology, crystallinity and indomethacin release. To minimize the amount of 
microspheres administered, a two-factor five-level central rotable composite 
2(2)+star design was employed with two independent variables: indomethacin 
percentage and PEG-derivative percentage. The optimum formulation showed mean 
encapsulation efficiency of 94.3+/-2.2% and released 7.99+/-0.25 microg 
indomethacin/day/mg microspheres for 21 days. A dose of 20-50 mg of this 
formulation could be appropriate to achieve both anti-angiogenic and 
anti-inflammatory effects. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies performed in rat 
splenocytes showed an adequate cell viability.
