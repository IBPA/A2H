Genetic susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with certain 
MHC class II molecules. To clarify the role of these determinants in RA, we 
generated the D1CC transgenic mouse that expressed genes involved in antigen 
processing and presentation by the MHC class II pathway in joints. The class II 
transactivator, which was transcribed from the rat collagen type II promoter and 
enhancer, directed the expression of these genes. In D1CC mice congenic for the 
H-2(q) (DBA/1) background, small amounts of bovine collagen type II in adjuvant 
induced reproducibly an inflammatory arthritis resembling RA. Importantly, these 
stimuli had no effect in DBA/1 mice. Eighty-nine percent of D1CC mice developed 
chronic disease with joint swelling, redness, and heat in association with 
synovial proliferation as well as pannus formation and mononuclear infiltration 
of synovial membranes. Granulomatous lesions resembling rheumatoid nodules and 
interstitial pneumonitis also were observed. As in patients with RA, anticyclic 
citrullinated peptide antibodies were detected during the inflammatory stage. 
Finally, joints in D1CC mice displayed juxtaarticular demineralization, severe 
joint space narrowing, and erosions, which led to ankylosis, but without the 
appearance of osteophytes. Thus, aberrant expression of MHC class II in joints 
facilitates the development of severe erosive inflammatory polyarthritis, which 
is very similar to RA.
