OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the anti-arthritis effect and its mechanism of 
a combination of herbal extracts from Trachelospermi caulis (TC) and Moutan 
cortex radicis (MC) (TCMC).
METHODS: The anti-arthritis activity of TCMC was assessed using a mouse model of 
type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrophoretic 
mobility shift assay (EMSA) and other biological assays were performed.
KEY FINDINGS: TCMC significantly ameliorated various inflammatory parameters, 
such as clinical arthritis index, histological deformation of joints, serum 
levels of rheumatoid arthritis biomarkers (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, 
serum amyloid P and anti-collagen type II IgG antibody), and Th1-related 
responses (T cell proliferation, and production of Interferon-γ and interleukin 
(IL)-2 in splenocytes isolated from CIA mice). The production of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α, 
IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein-1, monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell 
Expressed, and Secreted) was suppressed by TCMC in CIA mice. In addition, the 
number of osteoclasts in the hind tibia was significantly decreased. With regard 
to the mechanism, TCMC suppressed the activation of the transcription factors 
nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein (AP)-1.
CONCLUSIONS: TCMC exerts an anti-arthritis effect in CIA mice by suppression of 
the production of various inflammatory factors and the formation of osteoclasts 
through the inhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 activation.
