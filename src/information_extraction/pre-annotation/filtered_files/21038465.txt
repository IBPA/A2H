The rat model is a widely used animal model in research, its popularity perhaps 
only surpassed by the mouse model. Rats are the preferred models for the study 
of transplantation and certain tumor and autoimmune diseases. In particular, the 
understanding of cardiovascular-related diseases and chronic inflammation has 
depended widely on the rat, from which models for both multiple sclerosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis have been derived. Until now, research in the rat has been 
hampered by a lack of precise gene-targeting technology in this model. This 
limitation, however, is rapidly changing; a recent example is the availability 
of B-cell-deficient rat strains obtained by the newly established zinc finger 
nucleases-targeting technology. As described in this issue of the European 
Journal of Immunology, genetic targeting of the rat, for example, using zinc 
finger nucleases-targeting technology, is likely to rapidly drive progress in 
the understanding of not only B-cell biology but also in the general 
understanding of rat disease models.
