OBJECTIVE: Inhibitors of prostaglandin production, such as nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and pharmacologic nitric oxide (NO) donors, 
such as organic nitrates, have been suggested to protect against bone loss in 
both humans and experimental animals. Recently, a new class of nitrosylated 
NSAID (known as NO-NSAIDs) has been developed, which combines the properties of 
a NO donor with those of a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. This study 
investigated the effects of one of these compounds, flurbiprofen 
nitroxybutylester (HCT1026), on bone metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The effects of HCT1026 on osteoclast formation and resorption were 
determined in vitro using cocultures of primary mouse osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts. The effect of HCT1026 in vivo was assessed using a mouse model of 
ovariectomy-induced bone loss.
RESULTS: HCT1026 was significantly more efficacious than the parent compound, 
flurbiprofen, at inhibiting osteoclast formation and bone resorption in vitro, 
and these effects could not be reproduced by combinations of flurbiprofen with a 
variety of NO donors. Studies in vivo showed that HCT1026 protected against 
ovariectomy-induced bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption, 
whereas flurbiprofen at similar concentrations was ineffective.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HCT1026 is a potent inhibitor of bone 
resorption in vitro and protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo 
by a novel mechanism that appears to be distinct from its NO donor properties 
and from its inhibitory effects on COX activity. We conclude that HCT1026 may be 
of clinical value in the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases such 
as rheumatoid arthritis, which are characterized by joint inflammation as well 
as periarticular and systemic bone loss.
