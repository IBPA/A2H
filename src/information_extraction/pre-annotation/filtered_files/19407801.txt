Gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, denoted RNA interference, represents a 
new paradigm for rational drug design. However, the transformative therapeutic 
potential of short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been stymied by a key 
obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo. Macrophages are 
particularly attractive targets for RNA interference therapy because they 
promote pathogenic inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. Here we 
report the engineering of beta1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) 
as efficient oral delivery vehicles that potently silence genes in mouse 
macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as 
little as 20 microg kg(-1) siRNA directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha 
(Tnf-alpha) depleted its messenger RNA in macrophages recovered from the 
peritoneum, spleen, liver and lung, and lowered serum Tnf-alpha levels. 
Screening with GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) is a previously unknown mediator 
of cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in vivo 
protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by inhibiting Tnf-alpha 
and interleukin-1beta production. This technology defines a new strategy for 
oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human disease.
