Lysyl oxidase is a multifunctional enzyme required for collagen biosynthesis. 
Various growth factors regulate lysyl oxidase during osteoblast differentiation, 
subject to modulation by cytokines such as TNF-α in inflammatory osteopenic 
disorders including diabetic bone disease. Canonical Wnt signaling promotes 
osteoblast development. Here we investigated the effect of Wnt3a and TNF-α on 
lysyl oxidase expression in pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells, bone marrow stromal 
cells, and committed osteoblasts. Lysyl oxidase was up-regulated by a 
transcriptional mechanism 3-fold in C3H10T1/2 cells, and 2.5-fold in bone marrow 
stromal cells. A putative functional TCF/LEF element was identified in the lysyl 
oxidase promoter. Interestingly, lysyl oxidase was not up-regulated in committed 
primary rat calvarial- or MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. TNF-α down-regulated lysyl 
oxidase both in Wnt3a-treated and in non-treated C3H10T1/2 cells by a 
post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by miR203. Non-differentiated cells do 
not produce a collagen matrix; thus, a novel biological role for lysyl oxidase 
in pluripotent cells was investigated. Lysyl oxidase shRNAs effectively silenced 
lysyl oxidase expression, and suppressed the growth of C3H10T1/2 cells by 50%, 
and blocked osteoblast differentiation. We propose that interference with lysyl 
oxidase expression under excess inflammatory conditions such as those that occur 
in diabetes, osteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis can result in a diminished 
pool of pluripotent cells which ultimately contributes to osteopenia.
