Impaired apoptosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)‑fibroblast‑like synoviocytes 
(FLS) is pivotal in the process of RA. Peptidyl arginine deiminase type IV 
(PADI4) is associated with autoantibody regulation via histone citrullination in 
RA. The present study aimed to investigate the role of PADI4 in the apoptosis of 
RA‑FLS. FLS were isolated from patients with RA and a rat model. The effects of 
PADI4 on RA‑FLS were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia‑induced 
autophagy was induced by 1% O2 and was detected by immunohistochemical and 
immunofluorescence analysis; in addition, apoptosis was detected by flow 
cytometry. RA‑FLS obtained from RA rat model exhibited significant proliferation 
under severe hypoxia conditions. Hypoxia also significantly induced autophagy 
and elevated the expression of PADI4. Subsequently, short hairpin RNA‑mediated 
PADI4 knockdown was demonstrated to significantly inhibit hypoxia‑induced 
autophagy and promote apoptosis in RA‑FLS. The results of these in vitro and 
in vivo studies suggested that PADI4 may be closely associated with 
hypoxia‑induced autophagy, and the inhibition of hypoxia‑induced autophagy by 
PADI4 knockdown may contribute to an increase in the apoptosis of RA‑FLS.
