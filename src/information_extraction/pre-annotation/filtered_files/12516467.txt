OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of antiarthritis effects of Qufengshi 
Prescription.
METHODS: Adjuvant arthritis (AA) was applied as pathological model of rheumatoid 
arthritis and prednisone was used as positive control.
RESULTS: The Prescription at high and medium dosages significantly decreased the 
rising level of hydrogen peroxide and interleukin-1 in AA rats (P < 0.05), the 
potency being similar to prednisone.
CONCLUSION: Qufengshi Prescription Could reduce the rising level of 
interleukin-1 and hydrogen peroxide in AA rats, which may be part of mechanism 
of the antiarthritis effect.
