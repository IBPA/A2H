BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the effects of total saponins from 
Rhizoma Dioscoreae Nipponicae (TS-RDN) on the expression of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 and Tie-2 (endothelial tyrosine 
kinase receptor) receptors in the synovium of rats with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) (collagen-induced arthritis; CIA), and to examine the mechanisms of TS-RDN 
in alleviating RA.
METHODS: The CIA rat model was established and the animals were randomly divided 
into control, CIA model, TS-RDN, diosgenin, and tripterygium groups. Fluorescent 
polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect VEGF expression in the rat 
knee joint synovium. Additionally, immunohistochemical assay was used to detect 
protein expression of Ang-2 and Tie-2 in the rat knee joint synovium.
RESULTS: Expression of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 in the model group was 
significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.01). After TS-RDN, 
tripterygium and diosgenin treatment, VEGF and Ang-2 expression was lower than 
in the model group (p < 0.01). However, Tie-2 expression showed no significant 
difference. The effects of TS-RDN on VEGF expression were more marked than those 
of tripterygium and diosgenin (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: TS-RDN might reduce the expression of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 in the 
synovium, thus inhibiting synovial angiogenesis and playing a therapeutic role 
in RA.
