TNF-α plays a key role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
inflammatory bone loss. Unfortunately, treatment of RA with anti-inflammatory 
glucocorticoids (GCs) also causes bone loss resulting in osteoporosis. Our 
previous studies showed that overexpression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine 
zipper (GILZ), a mediator of GC's anti-inflammatory effect, can enhance 
osteogenic differentiation in vitro and bone acquisition in vivo. To investigate 
whether GILZ could antagonize TNF-α-induced arthritic inflammation and protect 
bone in mice, we generated a TNF-α-GILZ double transgenic mouse line (TNF-GILZ 
Tg) by crossbreeding a TNF-α Tg mouse, which ubiquitously expresses human TNF-α, 
with a GILZ Tg mouse, which expresses mouse GILZ under the control of a 3.6kb 
rat type I collagen promoter fragment. Results showed that overexpression of 
GILZ in bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells protected mice from 
TNF-α-induced inflammatory bone loss and improved bone integrity (TNF-GILZ 
double Tg vs. TNF-αTg, n = 12-15). However, mesenchymal cell lineage restricted 
GILZ expression had limited effects on TNF-α-induced arthritic inflammation as 
indicated by clinical scores and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines.
