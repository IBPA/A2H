OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of bone marrow cells (BMC) in the induction 
of antigen induced arthritis (AIA), the expression of 3 major proinflammatory 
cytokines, interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-alpha), and IL-6, was examined in the bone marrow (BM) of mice with AIA. We 
also examined whether AIA could be transferred by bone marrow transplantation 
(BMT).
METHODS: Expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in BMC was assessed by 
immunohistochemistry throughout the course of AIA. BMT experiments were 
performed using 2 different mouse genotypes, wild type (IL-6+/+) and IL-6 
deficient (IL-6-/-) mice, as a donor. The gradation of AIA was evaluated 
histologically.
RESULTS: IL-6 was highly expressed in the BM at induction as well as during 
progression of AIA, while TNF-alpha showed a marginal expression, and no 
significant expression of IL-1beta was detected throughout the course of AIA. In 
BMT experiments, all irradiated IL-6+/+ mice developed typical AIA by 
transplantation of BMC from immunized IL-6+/+ mice, whereas almost no irradiated 
IL- 6+/+ mice transplanted with BMC from the immunized IL-6-/- mice developed 
definite arthritis.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BMC play a critical role and IL-6 is a 
key cytokine for the induction and progression of AIA. There may be clinical 
benefits in the blockade of IL-6 and BMT in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis.
