(5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) extracts from Tripterygium have 
anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and immunity adjustment functions. The present 
study used a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model to evaluate whether LLDT-8 
prevents collagen-induced arthritis, and investigated the signaling underlying 
this. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced to generate CIA, mimicking 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The presence of arthritis was determined using RA 
progression scores. The inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and 
nuclear factor-κB were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. 
Induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-13 protein 
expression were measured using western blot analysis. Lastly, reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate 
osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) gene 
expression. LLDT-8 improved RA progression scores and reduced the incidence and 
severity of CIA. Furthermore, LLDT-8 administration inhibited collagen-induced 
inflammation and iNOS protein expression in arthritic rats. The current data 
indicated that MMP-13 production was suppressed and OPG/RANKL expression was 
increased by LLDT-8 treatment in the arthritic rat. The present results suggest 
that LLDT-8 attenuates CIA through OPG/RANK/RANK ligand signaling in a rat model 
of RA.
