Rheumatoid arthritis is one major chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune 
disease. The CD154-CD40 interactions play a critical role in the regulation of 
immune responses and the maintenance of autoimmunity. Therefore, we aimed to 
determine whether anti-CD154 antibody treatment show positive effects on 
immunomodulation and clinical improvement of sustained severe rheumatoid 
arthritis in cynomolgus monkeys. Arthritis was induced using chicken type II 
collagen (CII) and arthritic monkey were divided into control and anti-CD154 
treatment groups based on their concentrations of anti-CII antibodies on week 7 
post-immunization. Blood and tissue samples were collected on week 16 
post-immunization. Anti-CD154 antibody treatment improved arthritis and 
movement, and significantly decreased the numbers of proliferating B cells and 
the serum levels of anti-type II collagen antibody and sCD154 compared with 
non-treatment group. Further anti-CD154 antibody treatment significantly 
decreased the percentage of CD4+ cells and the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells and 
significantly increased the percentage of CD8+ cells and effector memory CD8+ 
cells in peripheral blood. We have shown for the first time in a nonhuman 
primate model of RA that CD154 blockade has beneficial effects. This study might 
be valuable as preclinical data of CD154 blockade in nonhuman primate models of 
severe rheumatoid arthritis.
