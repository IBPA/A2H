OBJECTIVE: Increased numbers of mast cells (MCs) that express beta tryptases 
bound to heparin have been detected in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). The corresponding tryptases in mice are mouse MC protease 6 
(mMCP-6) and mMCP-7. Although MCs have been implicated in RA and some animal 
models of arthritis, no direct evidence for a MC-restricted tryptase in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis has been shown. We created transgenic 
mice that lack heparin and different combinations of mMCP-6 and mMCP-7, to 
evaluate the roles of MC-restricted tryptase-heparin complexes in an 
experimental model of arthritis.
METHODS: The methylated bovine serum albumin/interleukin-1beta (mBSA/IL-1beta) 
experimental protocol was used to induce inflammatory monarthritis in different 
mouse strains. Mice were killed at the time of peak disease on day 7, and 
histochemical methods were used to assess joint pathology.
RESULTS: Arthritis was induced in the knee joints of mBSA/IL-1beta-treated 
mMCP-6(+)/mMCP-7(-) and mMCP-6(-)/mMCP-7(+) C57BL/6 mice, and numerous activated 
MCs that had exocytosed the contents of their secretory granules were observed 
in the diseased mice. In contrast, arthritis was markedly reduced in 
heparin-deficient mice and in mMCP-6(-)/mMCP-7(-) C57BL/6 mice.
CONCLUSION: MC-derived tryptase-heparin complexes play important roles in 
mBSA/IL-1beta-induced arthritis. Because mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 can compensate for 
each other in this disease model, the elimination of both tryptases is necessary 
to reveal the prominent roles of these serine proteases in joint inflammation 
and destruction. Our data suggest that the inhibition of MC-restricted tryptases 
could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of RA.
