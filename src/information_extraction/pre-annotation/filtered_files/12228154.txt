BACKGROUND: Interleukin 17 (IL17) is produced by activated T cells and has been 
implicated in the development of bone lesions and cartilage degradation in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether IL17, alone or together with tumour necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFalpha), induces cartilage destruction in vitro.
METHODS: Fetal mouse metatarsals stripped of endogenous osteoclast precursors 
were used to study the effect of IL17 on cartilage degradation independently of 
osteoclastic resorption. Cartilage destruction was analysed histologically by 
Alcian blue staining.
RESULTS: IL17 alone, up to 100 ng/ml, had no effect on the cartilage of fetal 
mouse metatarsals. IL17 (>/=0.1 ng/ml), however, induced severe cartilage 
degradation when given together with TNFalpha (>/=1 ng/ml). The cytokine 
combination decreased Alcian blue staining, a marker of proteoglycans, 
throughout the metatarsals and induced loss of the proliferating and early 
hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. TNFalpha alone also decreased Alcian blue 
staining, but not as dramatically as the cytokine combination. In addition, it 
did not induce loss of chondrocyte zones. Treatment with inhibitors of matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and nitric oxide synthesis showed that MMP 
activity played a part in cartilage degradation, whereas nitric oxide production 
did not.
CONCLUSIONS: IL17, together with TNFalpha, induced cartilage degradation in 
fetal mouse metatarsals in vitro. IL17 may, therefore, participate in the 
development of cartilage destruction associated with RA by enhancing the effects 
of TNFalpha and may provide a potential therapeutic target.
