Human and murine lymphocytes express dopamine (DA) D2-like receptors including 
DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4. However, their roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are less 
clear. Here we showed that lymphocyte DRD2 activation alleviates both imbalance 
of T-helper (Th)17/T-regulatory (Treg) cells and inflamed symptoms in a mouse 
arthritis model of RA. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was prepared by 
intradermal injection of chicken collagen type II (CII) in tail base of DBA/1 
mice or Drd2 (-/-) C57BL/6 mice. D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole 
downregulated expression of proinflammatory Th17-related cytokines interleukin- 
(IL-) 17 and IL-22 but further upregulated expression of anti-inflammatory 
Treg-related cytokines transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β and IL-10 in 
lymphocytes in vitro and in ankle joints in vivo in CIA mice. Quinpirole 
intraperitoneal administration reduced both clinical arthritis score and serum 
anti-CII IgG level in CIA mice. However, Drd2 (-/-) CIA mice manifested more 
severe limb inflammation and higher serum anti-CII IgG level and further 
upregulated IL-17 and IL-22 expression and downregulated TGF-β and IL-10 
expression than wild-type CIA mice. In contrast, Drd1 (-/-) CIA mice did not 
alter limb inflammation or anti-CII IgG level compared with wild-type CIA mice. 
These results suggest that DRD2 activation is involved in alleviation of CIA 
symptoms by amelioration of Th17/Treg imbalance.
