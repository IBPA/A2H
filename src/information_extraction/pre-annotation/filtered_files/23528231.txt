Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 inhibition has been proposed as an 
alternative to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition in the treatment of pain and 
inflammation. This novel approach could potentially mitigate the 
gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular side effects seen after long-term treatment 
with traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Coxibs 
respectively. Several human mPGES-1 inhibitors have been developed in the recent 
years. However, they were all shown to be considerably less active on rodent 
mPGES-1, precluding the study of mPGES-1 inhibition in rodent models of 
inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to characterize the new mPGES-1 
inhibitor compound II, a pyrazolone that has similar potency on rat and human 
recombinant mPGES-1, in experimental models of inflammation. In cell culture, 
compound II inhibited PGE2 production in synovial fibroblasts from patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RASF) and in rat peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, compound 
II was first characterized in the rat air pouch model of inflammation where 
treatment inhibited intra-pouch PGE2 production. Compound II was also 
investigated in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model where it attenuated both 
the acute and delayed inflammatory responses. In conclusion, compound II 
represents a valuable pharmacological tool for the study of mPGES-1 inhibition 
in rat models.
