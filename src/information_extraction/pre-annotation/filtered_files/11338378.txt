Angiogenesis is a process involved in several physiological events including 
embryonic development, female reproductive cycle placentation and wound repair. 
It also plays a part in various pathological conditions such as tumor growth, 
diabetic retinopathy and rheumatoid arthritis. Angiogenesis is a very complex 
multistep process involving a variety of biologically active substances, among 
which are the prostaglandins (PGs), which can induce several growth factors and 
proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Angiogenesis is 
reportedly enhanced by prostaglandins (PGs). We investigated whether or not 
COX-2 mediated angiogenesis in chronic and proliferate granuloma. In rat sponge 
implants, angiogenesis was gradually developed over a 14-day experimental period 
as granuloma formed. In sponge granuloma, mRNA of COX-1 was constitutively 
expressed, whereas that of COX-2 was increased with neovascularization in 
parallel with the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). bFGF-stimulated angiogenesis was inhibited by indomethacin or a 
selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398. These results suggested that endogenous PGs 
generated through COX-2 may enhance the neovascularization in sponge granuloma 
by increased expression of VEGF and that a COX-2 inhibitor would facilitate the 
management of conditions involving angiogenesis.
