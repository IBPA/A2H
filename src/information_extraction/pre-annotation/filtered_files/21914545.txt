OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the 
ethanol and aqueous extracts of prop roots of Pandanus fascicularis (P. 
fascicularis) Lam (pandanaceae). And provide experimental evidence for its 
traditional use such as rheumatoid arthritis and spasmodic.
METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity was observed by carrageenan-induced 
edema of the hind paw of rats. Analgesic activities of prop roots of P. 
fascicularis were determined using acetic acid induced writhing model and tail 
clip method in mice and rat, respectively. The ethanol fraction was then 
subjected to chromatographic analysis and a compound has been isolated and 
characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR and mass spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Edema suppressant effect of ethanol extract was found to be 37.03% 
inhibition whereas aqueous extract was found to be 63.22% inhibition after 3 h 
which was nearly equivalent to that of 10 mg/kg of indomethacin (67.81%). 
Percentage inhibition of writhing compared to control were 63.15%, 54.38%, 
14.90% for aspirin, aqueous extract and ethanolic extract, respectively. Both 
ethanol and aqueous extracts show significant activity against appropriate 
controls after 60 min of treatment on tail clip method. The structure of the 
isolated compound is may be characterized as Hepta deca-5-ene-1-ol by analysis 
it's IR, (1)H-NMR and mass spectroscopy data.
CONCLUSIONS: The extracts of prop roots of P. fascicularis produce significant 
analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, supporting the traditional 
application of this herb in treating various diseases associated with 
inflammation and pain.
