Evidences are accumulating that extract of Acanthopanax senticosus Harms (ASH; 
syn Eleutherococcus senticosus [Rupr. & Maxim.] Maxim), a shrub native to 
Northeastern Asia, has antiinflammatory effects. In this study, we examined 
prophylactic and therapeutic effects of ASH extract (ASHE) on rheumatoid 
arthritis using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Acanthopanax 
senticosus Harms extract was administered before the onset of arthritis in the 
prophylaxis model. In the therapeutic model, ASHE was administered after the 
onset of arthritis with or without anti-TNF-α antibody. The ASHE treatment 
showed efficacy before onset of CIA but there was no effect after CIA was 
established. The ASHE treatment delayed the onset and decreased severity of CIA. 
In vitro examinations showed that ASHE is an antioxidant and that ASHE 
suppresses TNF-α and interleukin-6 production in human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. The combination therapy with ASHE and anti-TNF-α antibody 
reduced the severity of arthritis compared with anti-TNF-α antibody alone. The 
present study shows that ASHE has prophylactic effect against CIA and support 
therapeutic effect of anti-TNF-α antibody.
