In order to explore the potential therapeutic effect of Yunnan Baiyao (YNB) on 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rat models were constructed and orally administrated 
with YNB or methotrexate (MTX) in parallel. Clinical physical, histological and 
biochemical parameters showed trivial therapeutic difference between YNB and MTX 
applications. Urine and serum metabonomics results indicated that many 
endogenous metabolites differentially changed among the rats receiving diverse 
therapeutic interventions. Among them, the fluctuation of arachidonic acid (AA) 
was thought to make sense. Thus, its relevant metabolites were subjected to 
quantitation by using osteoblasts treated by YNB in vitro. It was found that YNB 
extract of 20 μg/mL could greatly activate the synthesis of intracellular 
prostaglandin E₂ and thromboxane B₂ in osteoblasts. Excretion of prostaglandin 
D₂ could be suppressed but not the thromboxane B₂. This study proved the 
efficacy of YNB on curing RA and its potential mechanism through modulating AA 
metabolism in osteoblasts to some extent.
