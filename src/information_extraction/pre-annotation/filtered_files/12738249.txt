We investigated the proinflammatory activities of S100A12 in the context of 
synovial inflammation. S100A12 levels were increased in the synovial fluids and 
plasma of patients with gout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and 
undetectable in osteoarthritis, a noninflammatory disorder. S100A12 proved to 
induce neutrophil adhesion to fibrinogen via Mac-1 at concentrations similar to 
those found in the synovial fluids. Similar concentrations induced the 
recruitment of large numbers of neutrophils and monocytes in the murine air 
pouch model. To characterize the effect of increased S100A12 plasma levels, mice 
were injected intravenously with S100A12. This led to the mobilization of 
neutrophils from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. These results suggest 
that S100A12 stimulates the accumulation of neutrophil by inducing their release 
from the bone marrow, as well as by activating their adhesion and migration 
toward inflammatory sites.
