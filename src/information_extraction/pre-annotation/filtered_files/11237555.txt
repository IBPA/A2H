In the present study, we demonstrated the anti-arthritic effect of humanized 
anti-human IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody, MRA, in cynomolgus monkey. MRA can 
react with monkey IL-6R and block signal transduction of IL-6. Collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) was induced by twice immunizing with bovine type II collagen 
(CII) emulsified with complete adjuvant. MRA was intravenously injected once a 
week, from the day of the first collagen immunization, for 13 weeks. The 
symptoms of arthritis were evaluated using a visual scoring system and 
radiography. Inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and concentrations of anti-CII antibody, 
anti-MRA antibody, and MRA were monitored regularly. At the end of the study, 
histological evaluation was carried out. MRA, at a dose of 10 mg/kg, gave rise 
to statistically significant suppression. The elevation of serum CRP and 
fibrinogen levels and ESR were also inhibited. Furthermore, radiographic and 
histological examination showed that MRA treatment suppressed joint destruction. 
Our results demonstrate that IL-6 plays an important role in monkey CIA and that 
MRA may be an attractive agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
