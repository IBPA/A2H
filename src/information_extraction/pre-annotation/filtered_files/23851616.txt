Avastin is the monoclonal antibody for vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). This study aimed to investigate therapeutic effect of Avastin on type II 
collagen-induced arthritis. Type II chicken collagen was injected into the tails 
of Wistar rats, and 60 modeled female rats were randomly divided into three 
groups (n = 20): Avastin group, Etanercept group, and control group. Arthritis 
index and joint pad thickness were scored, and the pathology of back metapedes 
was analyzed. The results showed that compared to control group, the arthritis 
index, target-to-non-target ratio, synovial pathological injury index, serum 
levels of VEGF and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and VEGF staining were decreased 
significantly 14 days after Avastin or Etanercept treatment, but there were no 
significant differences between Avastin group and Etanercept group. These data 
provide evidence that Avastin exhibits similar effects to Etanercept to relieve 
rheumatoid arthritis in rat model and suggest that Avastin is a promising 
therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis.
