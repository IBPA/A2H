BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying tolerance induction and maintenance in 
autoimmune arthritis remain elusive. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, 
collagen type II (CII)-induced arthritis, we explore the contribution of B cells 
to antigen-specific tolerance.
METHODS: To generate expression of the CII-peptide specifically on B-cell major 
histocompatibility complex type II, lentiviral-based gene therapy including a 
B-cell-specific Igk promoter was used.
RESULTS: Presentation of the CII-peptide on B cells significantly reduced the 
frequency and severity of arthritis as well as the serum levels of CII -specific 
IgG antibodies. Further, both frequency and suppressive function of regulatory T 
cells were increased in tolerized mice. Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells 
from tolerized mice to na√Øve mice ameliorated the development of CII-induced 
arthritis.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that endogenous presentation of the CII-peptide on 
B cells is one of the key contributors to arthritis tolerance induction and 
maintenance.
