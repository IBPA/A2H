CXCL14 is a relatively new chemokine with unidentified receptor and undefined 
function. Recently, we found that CXCL14 is upregulated in arthritic joints in a 
mouse model of autoimmune arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis. To examine the 
role of CXCL14 in the development and pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis, we 
have generated transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress CXCL14 under control of 
phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The results showed that CXCL14-Tg mice 
developed more severe arthritis compared with wild-type controls. The draining 
lymph nodes of CXCL14-Tg mice were significantly enlarged and contained an 
increased number of activated T cells, particularly the CD44(+)CD62L(low) 
effector memory cells. In addition, T cells from CXCL14-Tg mice exhibited an 
enhanced proliferative response against collagen II and produced higher levels 
of IFN-gamma but not IL-4 or IL-17. CXCL14-Tg mice also had elevated levels of 
IgG2a autoantibodies. These findings indicated that CXCL14 plays an important 
role in the autoimmune arthritis, which may have an implication in understanding 
the pathogenic mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis in humans and, ultimately, 
therapeutic interference.
