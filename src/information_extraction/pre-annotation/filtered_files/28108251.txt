As demonstrated in preclinical animal models, the disruption of PI3Kδ expression 
or its activity leads to a decrease in inflammatory and immune responses. 
Therefore, inhibition of PI3Kδ may provide an alternative treatment for 
autoimmune diseases, such as RA, SLE, and respiratory ailments. Herein, we 
disclose the identification of 
7-(3-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine derivatives as 
highly potent, selective and orally bioavailable PI3Kδ inhibitors. The lead 
compound demonstrated efficacy in an in vivo mouse KLH model.
