The treatment of some inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
remains an important target for studies because some patients are refractory to 
conventional treatment. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive drug, 
has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the therapy of inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the 
anti-inflammatory effect of MMF administered by oral route in the mouse 
carrageenan-induced air pouch model.
RESULTS: MMF significantly inhibited the influx of leukocytes, exudate 
concentrations (P<0.01), activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and adenosine 
deaminase (ADA), levels of nitrite/nitrate (NO(x)) and inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression, as well as the levels of mRNA expression and 
proteins of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-beta (IL-1β) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor-alpha (VEGF-α) (P<0.05). These results 
provide evidence that MMF has an important anti-inflammatory effect in reducing 
the influx of leukocytes and exudate concentrations. These inhibitory effects 
are correlated with the inhibition of specific pro-inflammatory enzymes (MPO, 
ADA and iNOS), and the levels of mRNA expression and proteins of TNF-α, IL-1β 
and VEGF-α.
