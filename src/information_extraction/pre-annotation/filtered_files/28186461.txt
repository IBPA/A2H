AIM: The aim of present research was to complex aceclofenac with lysine (LYS) 
and the developed aceclofenac-LYS cocrystal was encapsulated in lipid bilayers 
of liposomes by employing dual carrier approach for the treatment of 
pain-related disorders in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MATERIALS & METHODS: The developed carriers were characterized for particle 
size, drug release, ex vivo and in vivo studies, dermatokinetic modeling, 
complete freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA rat model, radiant heat tail-flick 
method, formalin-induced paw-licking model, paw edema model and xylene-induced 
ear edema model in mice.
RESULTS: The developed nanoliposomes offered nanometric size, controlled drug 
release and enhanced drug permeation. Further, hydrogel incorporated nanoproduct 
was found to be rheologically acceptable and substantially compatible with 
rodent skin.
CONCLUSION: The studies indicated the superiority of LYS-conjugated 
liposome-entrapped nanocarriers for improved management of conditions like RA 
over the marketed product.
