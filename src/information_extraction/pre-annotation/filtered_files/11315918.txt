OBJECTIVE: Although increased vascularity was noted in early histopathologic 
studies of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) synovium, the available data on 
angiogenesis in JRA are very limited. The main purposes of this study were to 
assess expression of the key angiogenic factors in JRA synovium, and to evaluate 
a SCID mouse model of JRA as an approach to study in vivo regulation of the 
expression of these factors in JRA.
METHODS: RNase protection assay was used to assess the expression of the key 
angiogenic factors in fresh JRA synovium and in JRA synovial tissue fragments 
that had been minced and then implanted into SCID mice. Vascularity of the 
samples was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor. 
Synovial specimens obtained from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or other 
noninflammatory arthropathies were used as controls.
RESULTS: Detectable levels of messenger RNA for vascular endothelial growth 
factor and angiopoietin 1 and their respective receptors, as well as endoglin 
and thrombin receptors, were present in all JRA tissue specimens studied. The 
levels of expression of these factors in JRA tissues were significantly higher 
than those in tissues obtained from patients with OA or other noninflammatory 
arthropathies. Furthermore, increased expression of the key angiogenic factors 
in the fresh JRA tissues correlated with the exuberant revascularization of JRA 
minced tissue fragments implanted into SCID mice. This was in sharp contrast to 
the poor revascularization of implanted OA tissues.
CONCLUSION: JRA synovium is characterized by high angiogenic activity. SCID 
mouse-human JRA synovium chimeras may provide a good approach to study the in 
vivo regulation of angiogenesis in JRA.
