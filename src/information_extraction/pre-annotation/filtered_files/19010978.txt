Mast cells are implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism by which 
they contribute to disease progression is not clarified. Here we investigated 
whether mouse mast cell protease-4 (mMCP-4), a chymase present in the mast cell 
secretory granule, contributes to experimental arthritis. Two models of 
arthritis were investigated in mMCP-4(+/+) and mMCP-4(-/-) DBA/1 mice: 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced by immunization with collagen II 
(CII) in Freund's complete adjuvant, and a passive model of arthritis was 
induced by administration of anti-CII antibodies. The clinical scores were 
significantly reduced in the mMCP-4(-/-) animals as compared to mMCP-4(+/+) 
controls in both arthritis models. In CIA, the number of affected paws was lower 
in the CII-immunized mMCP-4(-/-) mice, with less cartilage destruction, pannus 
formation, and mononuclear cell and mast cell influx in the mMCP-4(-/-) joints. 
Interestingly, the lower clinical scores in the CII-immunized mMCP-4(-/-) mice 
coincided with lower serum levels of immunoglobulin G anti-CII antibodies. Our 
findings identify a pathogenic role of mMCP-4 in autoimmune arthritis.
