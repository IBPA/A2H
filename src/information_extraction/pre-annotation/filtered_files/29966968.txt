Paeoniflorin (PF) has many effects, such as anti-inflammation, 
immune-regulation, abirritation, and so on. However, the protective mechanisms 
of PF on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was not completely known. Thus, we explored 
deeply the protective mechanisms in a collagen-induced RA (CIA) rat model. CIA 
was induced in rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen in 
complete Freund's adjuvant. Later, the CIA rats received oral administration of 
PF (50 and 100 mg/kg) once a day from the day 21, with the treatment lasting for 
14 days. A variety of indicators were measured for evaluation of anti-rheumatism 
effect, including paw swelling, arthritis scores, and histopathological changes. 
And the contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the 
serum, as well as p-NF-κB p65 and p-MYPT1 in the joint synovial tissues were 
detected to explore the possible mechanisms. The results demonstrated that PF 
treatment significantly ameliorated the symptoms in CIA rats, reduced the levels 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and paw swelling, down-regulated the expressions 
of p-NF-κB p65 and p-MYPT1. The present results revealed that PF could 
effectively improve collagen-induced RA in rats by inhibiting Rho kinase 
activation in the joint synovial tissues, in turn down-regulating expression of 
p-NF-κB p65 and reducing contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, PF 
may be an effective agent for RA.
