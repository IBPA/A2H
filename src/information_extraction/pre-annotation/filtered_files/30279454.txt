In oriental medicine, centipede Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans has long been 
used as a remedy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a well-known chronic autoimmune 
disorder. However, the molecular identities of its bioactive components have not 
yet been extensively investigated. We sought to identify bioactive molecules 
that control RA with a centipede. A novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP) 
(scolopendrasin IX) was identified from Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans. 
Scolopendrasin IX markedly activated mouse neutrophils, by enhancing cytosolic 
calcium increase, chemotactic cellular migration, and generation of superoxide 
anion in neutrophils. As a target receptor for scolopendrasin IX, formyl peptide 
receptor (FPR)2 mediates neutrophil activation induced by the AMP. Furthermore, 
scolopendrasin IX administration strongly blocked the clinical phenotype of RA 
in an autoantibody-injected model. Mechanistically, the novel AMP inhibited 
inflammatory cytokine synthesis from the joints and neutrophil recruitment into 
the joint area. Collectively, we suggest that scolopendrasin IX is a novel 
potential therapeutic agent for the control of RA via FPR2.
