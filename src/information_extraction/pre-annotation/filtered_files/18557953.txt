CD147 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on a wide variety of cell 
types, including all leucocytes. While CD147 is best known as a potent inducer 
of matrix metalloproteinases, it can also function as a regulator of leucocyte 
migration through its cell surface interaction with chemotactic extracellular 
cyclophilins. A potential role for CD147-cyclophilin interactions during 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is suggested from 
several studies. For example, CD147 expression is increased on reactive 
leucocytes in the synovial fluid and tissues of patients with arthritis. In 
addition, the synovial fluid of patients with RA contains high levels of 
extracellular cyclophilin A. In the current studies we investigated the 
contribution of the chemotactic function of CD147-cyclophilin interactions to 
joint inflammation using the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Our data 
demonstrate that proinflammatory leucocytes, specifically neutrophils, monocytes 
and activated CD4(+) T cells, lose their ability to migrate in response to 
cyclophilin A in vitro when treated with anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody. 
Furthermore, in vivo treatment with anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody can reduce 
the development of collagen-induced arthritis in mice by >75%. Such findings 
suggest that CD147-cyclophilin interactions might contribute to the pathogenesis 
of RA by promoting the recruitment of leucocytes into joint tissues.
