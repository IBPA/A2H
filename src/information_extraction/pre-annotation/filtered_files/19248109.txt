OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-33 (IL-33; or, IL-1F11) was recently identified as the 
ligand of the IL-1 family receptor T1/ST2. The aim of this study was to examine 
IL-33 production in human and mouse joints and to investigate the role of IL-33 
and T1/ST2 in experimental arthritis.
METHODS: IL-33 expression was examined in human synovial tissue, rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts, and arthritic mouse joints. Mice with 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with blocking anti-ST2 antibody or 
control antibody beginning at the onset of disease. Arthritis severity was 
assessed by clinical and histologic scoring. Draining lymph node (LN) cell 
responses were examined ex vivo, and joint messenger RNA (mRNA) was used for 
expression profiling.
RESULTS: IL-33 was highly expressed in human RA synovium. In cultured synovial 
fibroblasts, IL-33 expression was strongly induced by IL-1beta and/or tumor 
necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore, IL-33 mRNA was detected in the joints of 
mice with CIA and increased during the early phase of the disease. 
Administration of a blocking anti-ST2 antibody at the onset of disease 
attenuated the severity of CIA and reduced joint destruction. Anti-ST2 antibody 
treatment was associated with a marked decrease in interferon-gamma production 
as well as with a more limited reduction in IL-17 production by ex 
vivo-stimulated draining LN cells. Finally, RANKL mRNA levels in the joint were 
reduced by anti-ST2 treatment.
CONCLUSION: IL-33 is produced locally in inflamed joints, and neutralization of 
IL-33 signaling has a therapeutic effect on the course of arthritis. These 
observations suggest that locally produced IL-33 may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of joint inflammation and destruction.
