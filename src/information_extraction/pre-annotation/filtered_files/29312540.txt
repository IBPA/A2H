Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) play a key role in inflammatory diseases such as 
asthma and their receptors' antagonists are currently used as anti-asthmatic 
drugs. CysLTs have also been found to participate in other inflammatory 
reactions. Here, we reported that in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) animals model, 
collagen-induced arthritis, (CIA), CysLT1, a receptor for CysLTs, was 
up-regulated in hind paw and lymph node, while CysLTs levels in the blood were 
also higher than normal mice. Montelukast, a drug targeting CysLT1, has been 
shown to effectively reduce the CIA incidence, peak severity, and cumulative 
disease scores. Further study indicated that CysLT1 signaling did not affect the 
differentiation of pathogenic T helper cells. We conclude that montelukast may 
play important roles in the pathogenesis of CIA, mainly by inducing infiltration 
of pathogenic T cells, increasing IL-17A secretion and expression of IL-17A, 
while these effects can be blocked by CysLT1 antagonists. Our findings indicate 
that antagonist of CysLT1 receptor may be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
