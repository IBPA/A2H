OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF), an amebic 
peptide with antiinflammatory properties, was evaluated in collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) to test its effects on the onset and acute inflammatory response 
of arthritis.
MATERIAL: DBA1/J mice at 8-10 weeks of age were divided into four groups (eight 
mice per group).
TREATMENT: The adjuvant group received Freund adjuvant, the CIA group was 
immunized with collagen II, the MLIF/CIA group received collagen II and MLIF, 
and the MLIF group received MLIF and Freund adjuvant.
METHODS: All groups were evaluated clinically. Seven weeks after the collagen 
injection, at the peak of the clinical arthritis score, limb specimens were 
collected and histological studies and gene expression analysis using 
microarrays were performed.
RESULTS: MLIF administered weekly as a preventive scheme delayed and reduced the 
severity of acute arthritis. MLIF induced gene changes in functional categories 
including adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and inflammatory 
cytokines.
CONCLUSIONS: MLIF could be an interesting new molecule to investigate in the 
field of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis research for its potential to prevent 
inflammation.
