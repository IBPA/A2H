ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth. is used in 
Chinese traditional medicine to treat arthritis, especially has been used a long 
time ago on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in She ethnic minority group.
AIM OF THE RESEARCH: To investigate the anti-RA effect of Bauhinia championii 
(Benth.) Benth ethyl acetate extract (BCBEE) and the molecular bases of it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: BCBEE was studied on a rat model of RA induced by 
Ⅱcollagen in vivo, as well as on primary synovial cells in vitro.
RESULTS: After BCBEE treatment, in vivo, it was showed that paw and joint edema 
was inhibited, pathological joint changes was ameliorated and the levels of 
interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-<alpha>(TNF-α) was decreased 
significantly. The protein and mRNA expressions of nuclear factor-<kappa>B 
(NF-κB)(p65), IκB, p-IκB and IκB kinase beta (IκKβ) were also down-regulated. 
Moreover, the in vitro study revealed that BCBEE treatment inhibited primary 
synovial cells proliferation, and promoted down-regulation of NF-κB(p65), IκB, 
p-IκB and IκKβ.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the present study demonstrates that BCBEE produces 
a protection in a rat model of RA induced by Ⅱcollagen via inhibiting paw and 
joint edema, ameliorating pathological joint changes and regulating the levels 
of cytokines and its action mechanism maybe is via down-regulating NF-κB(p65), 
IκB, p-IκB and IκKβ expression.
