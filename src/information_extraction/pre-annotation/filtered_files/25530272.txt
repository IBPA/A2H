AIM: To investigate the effects of Tubastatin A, a selective histone 
deacetylase-6 inhibitor, on synovial inflammation and joint destruction in a 
collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mouse model.
METHODS: Collagen antibody-induced arthritis mice were given daily 
intraperitoneal injections of various concentrations of Tubastatin A (0, 10, 50, 
100 mg/kg). The clinical score and paw thickness were measured. Mice were 
sacrificed on day 15, and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 in the serum were analyzed using enyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two pathologists independently measured the 
synovitis score. Micro-computed tomography (CT) scans of the joints were 
performed to quantify joint destruction. The expression of IL-6 from human 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) after incubation with various doses of 
Tubastatin A (0, 0.75, 1.5, 3 μmol/L) was measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: The clinical arthritis score was significantly attenuated and paw 
thickness was lower in the group treated with 100 mg/kg Tubastatin A compared 
with those treated with vehicle alone. The synovitis score was significantly 
reduced in the 100 mg/kg Tubastatin A-treated group compared with the control 
group. Micro-CT showed that quantitative measures of joint destruction were 
significantly attenuated in the 100 mg/kg Tubastatin A-treated group compared 
with the control. The expression of IL-6 in the sera was lower in the mice 
treated with Tubastatin A compared with the control. The expression of IL-6 in 
human FLSs decreased dose-dependently after incubation with Tubastatin A without 
affecting cell viability.
CONCLUSIONS: Tubastatin A successfully ameliorated synovial inflammation and 
protected against joint destruction in CAIA mice, at least in part, by 
modulating IL-6 expression.
