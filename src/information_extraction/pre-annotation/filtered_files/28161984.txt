The purpose of this work was to formulate piperine solid lipid nanoparticle 
(SLN) dispersion to exploit its efficacy orally and topically. Piperine SLN were 
prepared by melt emulsification method and formula was optimized by the 
application of 32 factorial design. The nanoparticulate dispersion was evaluated 
for particle size, entrapment efficiency and zeta potential (ZP). Optimized 
batch (128.80 nm average size, 78.71% entrapment efficiency and -23.34 mV zeta 
potential) was characterized for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray 
diffraction which revealed amorphous nature of piperine in SLN. The prepared SLN 
were administered orally and topically to CFA-induced arthritic rats. Ex vivo 
study using Franz diffusion cell indicate that piperine from SLN gel formulation 
accumulates in the skin. Pharmacodynamic study result indicates both the topical 
and oral piperine evoked a significant response compared to orally administered 
chloroquine suspension. The results of ELISA show significant reduction in TNFα 
in treated rat which might be the reason behind the DMARD action of piperine 
SLN.
