Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular tyrosine kinases that mediate the 
signaling of numerous cytokines and growth factors involved in the regulation of 
immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. As JAK1 pairs with JAK2, JAK3, and 
TYK2, a JAK1-selective inhibitor would be expected to inhibit many cytokines 
involved in inflammation and immune function while avoiding inhibition of the 
JAK2 homodimer regulating erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signaling. Our 
efforts began with tofacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment 
of rheumatoid arthritis. Through modification of the 3-aminopiperidine linker in 
tofacitinib, we discovered highly selective JAK1 inhibitors with nanomolar 
potency in a human whole blood assay. Improvements in JAK1 potency and 
selectivity were achieved via structural modifications suggested by X-ray 
crystallographic analysis. After demonstrating efficacy in a rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (rAIA) model, PF-04965842 (25) was nominated as a 
clinical candidate for the treatment of JAK1-mediated autoimmune diseases.
