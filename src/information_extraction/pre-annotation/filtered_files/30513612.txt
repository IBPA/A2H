Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is an 
intracellular cysteine protease (paracaspase) that plays an integral role in 
innate and adaptive immunity. The phenothiazine mepazine has been shown to 
inhibit the proteolytic activity of MALT1 and is frequently used to study its 
biological role. MALT1 has recently been suggested as a therapeutic target in 
rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we analyzed the effect of mepazine on the receptor 
activator of nuclear factor κ-B (RANK)-induced osteoclastogenesis. The treatment 
of mouse bone marrow precursor cells with mepazine strongly inhibited the RANK 
ligand (RANKL)-induced formation of osteoclasts, as well as the expression of 
several osteoclast markers, such as TRAP, cathepsin K, and calcitonin. However, 
RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis equally well in bone marrow cells derived from 
wild-type and Malt1 knock-out mice. Furthermore, the protective effect of 
mepazine was not affected by MALT1 deficiency. Additionally, the absence of 
MALT1 did not affect RANK-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator 
protein 1 (AP-1) activation. Overall, these studies demonstrate that MALT1 is 
not essential for RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis, and implicate a 
MALT1-independent mechanism of action of mepazine that should be taken into 
account in future studies using this compound.
