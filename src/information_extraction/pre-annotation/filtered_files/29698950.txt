BACKGROUND: Dry skin induced by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes itching, which 
negatively influences a patient's quality of life. We previously reported that 
mast cells are related to dry skin in arthritic mice. However, the mechanism of 
mast cell activation is unclear. In this study, we examined the mechanism 
underlying the formation of dry skin induced by mast cells in arthritis that 
involves thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), neutrophils, reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), and glucocorticoids.
METHODS: Mice with DBA/1JJmsSlc collagen-induced arthritis were treated with 
inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies. We measured transepidermal water loss 
(TEWL) to examine the modulating signal of mast cells.
RESULTS: TEWL, the number of mast cells, and the plasma levels of TSLP, ROS, and 
corticosterone in the arthritic mice were increased when compared with the 
control mice. However, the mice treated with TSLP- and neutrophil-neutralizing 
antibodies and ROS and glucocorticoid receptor inhibitors (N-acetyl-L-cysteine 
[NAC] and RU-486, respectively) experienced an improvement. The ameliorating 
effect was most remarkable following treatment with NAC + RU-486.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that inhibiting ROS and glucocorticoids is 
important to ameliorate dry skin in arthritis, which may provide a novel 
treatment option for dry skin in RA patients.
