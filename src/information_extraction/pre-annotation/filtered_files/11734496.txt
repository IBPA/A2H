Celecoxib was the first of a new class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, 
the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors, marketed as having the same 
antiinflammatory efficacy as other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs without 
their increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration. Among the widest uses of 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is in the treatment of acute soft tissue 
injuries. Although the benefits of celecoxib have been shown when used for 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, we are unaware of any studies 
concerning its effect on soft tissues. We used the surgically incised medial 
collateral ligament of male Sprague-Dawley rats as an experimental model for 
acute ligament injuries to investigate the effects of celecoxib on ligament 
healing. Fifty rats underwent surgical transection of the right medial 
collateral ligament. Postoperatively, half were given celecoxib for the first 6 
days of recovery, the other half were not. The animals were sacrificed 14 days 
after the operation, and both the injured and uninjured medial collateral 
ligaments were mechanically tested to failure in tension. 
Celecoxib-treated/injured ligaments were found to have a 32% lower load to 
failure than untreated/injured ligaments. The results of this study do not 
support use of cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors in the treatment of ligament 
injuries.
