Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 belongs to an 
immunoglobulin super family and is expressed on neutrophils, mature monocytes 
and macrophages. The engagement of TREM-1 synergizes with several Toll Like 
Receptors (TLR) activation in amplifying the inflammatory response. TREM-1 
blockade using a fusion protein containing murine TREM-1 extracellular domain 
and human immunoglobulin Fc portion was reported to prevent death in mouse 
models of microbial peritonitis and protect from organ damage during other 
inflammatory diseases. There are many reports suggesting the involvement of 
TREM-1 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Blockade of TREM-1 could be 
a new therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis without impairing the host 
defense against microbes. In this report, we outline the role of TREM-1 and the 
trial of developing anti-rheumatic drugs by targeting its ligand.
