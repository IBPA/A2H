Abnormal store-operated calcium uptake has been observed in peripheral T 
lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and sustained intracellular 
calcium signalling is known to mediate the functions of many types of immune 
cells. Thus, it is hypothesized that regulating calcium entry through CRACM1 
(the pore-forming subunit of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels; 
also known as ORAI1) may be beneficial for the management of RA. Localized 
CRACM1 knockdown in the joints and draining lymph nodes (DLNs) of mice with 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was achieved via lentiviral-based delivery of 
shRNA targeting mouse CRACM1. Consistent with CRACM1 knockdown, calcium influx 
in synovial cells and the histopathological features of CIA were reduced. These 
effects were also associated with reduced levels of several notable inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-17A, and IFN-γ, in the joints. Additionally, 
CRACM1-shRNA reduced the number of bone marrow-derived osteoclasts in vitro as 
well as osteoclasts in CIA joints, which was associated with reduced RANKL 
levels in the serum and joints. In summary, inhibiting calcium entry by CRACM1 
knockdown suppressed arthritis development and may be therapeutically beneficial 
for RA patients.
