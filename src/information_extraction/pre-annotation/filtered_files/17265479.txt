OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II (Ang II) is known to have proinflammatory actions, and 
Ang II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors are up-regulated in the rheumatoid synovium, 
suggesting that this receptor could be a therapeutic target. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the antiinflammatory potential of the selective AT(1) 
receptor antagonist losartan, which is currently used for the treatment of 
cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: Dose-ranging studies of losartan (1-50 mg/kg) were initially conducted 
in a rat model of acute (carrageenan/kaolin) arthritis, with subsequent 
evaluation in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis (Freund's complete 
adjuvant). Losartan (10(-10) to 10(-6)M) was further tested ex vivo in human 
inflammatory synovitis, using collagenase-digested synovium.
RESULTS: Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses both revealed a 
substantial increase in AT(1) receptor protein content in synovium from acutely 
and chronically inflamed rat knee joints. Similarly, synovial Ang I/II protein 
content was elevated during inflammation. Losartan inhibited acute joint 
inflammation in a dose-dependent manner, with 15 mg/kg being the optimal dose 
(and used in subsequent studies). Both prophylactic and therapeutic 
administration of 15 mg/kg of losartan substantially reduced knee joint swelling 
in rats with adjuvant monarthritis (> or =50%; P < 0.0001). Losartan also 
suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha generation from inflamed human synovium 
in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Targeting the angiotensin pathway, particularly AT(1) receptors, 
could have significant therapeutic potential. Randomized placebo-controlled 
trials are now warranted to establish the extent to which angiotensin receptor 
blockers may provide antiinflammatory benefits.
