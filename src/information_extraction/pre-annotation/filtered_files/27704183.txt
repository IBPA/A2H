This study showed that autoimmune arthritis induces especially severe 
osteoporosis in the periarticular region adjacent to inflamed joints, suggesting 
that arthritis increases the fragility fracture risk near inflamed joints, which 
is frequently observed in patients with RA.
INTRODUCTION: Periarticular osteoporosis near inflamed joints is a hallmark of 
early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we show that rheumatic inflammation 
deteriorates the bone quality and bone quantity of periarticular bone, thereby 
decreasing bone strength and toughness in a mouse model of RA.
METHODS: Female BALB/c mice and SKG mice, a mutant mouse model of autoimmune 
arthritis on the BALB/c background, were used. At 12Â weeks of age, BALB/c mice 
underwent either Sham surgery or bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), and SKG mice 
underwent intraperitoneal injection of mannan to induce arthritis. Eight weeks 
later, the mice were killed and the femurs and tibias were subjected to 
micro-computed tomography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic 
imaging, X-ray diffraction, histology, and mechanical testing.
RESULTS: SKG mice developed significant trabecular bone loss in both the distal 
metaphysis of the femur and the lumbar vertebral body, but the extent of the 
bone loss was more severe in the distal metaphysis. Neither SKG nor OVX mice 
exhibited changes in the geometry and matrix properties of the diaphysis of the 
femur, whereas SKG mice, but not OVX mice, did exhibit changes in these 
properties in the distal metaphysis of the femur. Bone strength and fracture 
toughness of the distal metaphysis of the tibia adjacent to the inflamed ankle 
joint were significantly decreased in SKG mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune arthritis induces periarticular osteoporosis, 
characterized by deterioration of cortical bone geometry and quality as well as 
by trabecular bone loss, leading to severe bone fragility in periarticular bone 
adjacent to inflamed joints.
