AIMS: Previous studies have shown a higher incidence of alveolar bone loss in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and that patients with periodontitis are 
at a greater risk of developing RA. The aim of this study was to develop an 
animal model to assess the relationship between pre-existing periodontitis and 
experimental arthritis (EA).
METHODS: Periodontitis was first induced in mice by oral gavage with 
Porphyromonas gingivalis followed by EA using the collagen antibody-induced 
arthritis model. These animals were compared with animals with periodontitis 
alone, EA alone and no disease (controls). Visual changes in paw swelling were 
assessed to determine clinical development of EA. Alveolar bone and joint 
changes were assessed using micro-CT, histological analyses and 
immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of C-reactive protein were used to monitor 
systemic inflammation.
RESULTS: Mice with pre-existing periodontitis developed more severe arthritis, 
which developed at a faster rate. Mice with periodontitis only also showed 
evidence of loss of bone within the radiocarpal joint. There was also evidence 
of alveolar bone loss in mice with EA alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that pre-existing periodontitis 
exacerbated experimental arthritis in a mouse model.
