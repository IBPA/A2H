In the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, ibuprofen (IBU) is widely used; however, 
it has been limited the clinical use by its systemic side effect, such as 
gastrointestinal lesions. Therefore, we prepared topical gel ointment used IBU 
solid nanoparticles (IBUnano-gel formulation). In addition, we demonstrated 
their anti-inflammatory effect by using arthritis model rat (adjuvant-induced 
arthritis rat, AA rat). The gel formulations were prepared using additives 
(Carbopol 934, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and methylcellulose) and bead 
mill-method. The IBU particle size in the IBUnano-gel formulation was 208 nm. 
The increase in inflammation of the hind feet of AA rats was attenuated by the 
treatment with the IBUnano-gel formulation, and preventive effect was higher 
than that of a gel formulation containing IBUmicroparticles (IBUmicro-gel 
formulation, mean particle size 85.4 μm); the accumulation and permeability 
through the skin of IBU from the IBUnano-gel formulation were significantly 
larger in comparison with the IBUmicro-gel formulation. Further, no 
gastrointestinal lesions were observed in AA rats following the repetitive 
administration of the 5% IBUnano-gel formulation (0.30 g) for 42 days (once a 
day). These results suggest that the dermal application of IBU-nanoparticles 
provide effective and efficient therapy that spares patients from unwanted side 
effects.
