Type II collagen (CII) is expressed exclusively in the joint articular. Although 
the relationship between anti-CII immunity and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
has been studied for a long time, definitive conclusions have not been reached. 
CII, as an autoantigen, has been studied extensively in small animal models, 
such as mice, and the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model has increased our 
understanding of the pathogenesis of human RA. In the present report, we 
summarize the available information on anti-CII immunity and discuss recent 
updates regarding pathogenesis in the CIA model, including the role of Th17 
cells.
