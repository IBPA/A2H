OBJECTIVES: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) display an increased risk of 
heart failure independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. To 
elucidate myocardial disease in RA, we have investigated molecular and cellular 
remodelling of the heart in an established mouse model of RA.
METHODS: The collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) RA mouse model is 
characterised by joint inflammation and increased inflammatory markers in the 
serum. We used CAIA mice in the postinflammatory phase that resembles medically 
controlled RA or RA in remission. Hearts were collected for cardiomyocyte 
isolation, biochemistry and histology analysis.
RESULTS: Hearts from mice subjected to CAIA displayed hypertrophy (heart/body 
weight, mean±SD: 5.9±0.8vs 5.1±0.7 mg/g, p<0.05), fibrosis and reduced left 
ventricular fractional shortening compared with control. Cardiomyocytes from 
CAIA mice showed reduced cytosolic [Ca2+]i transient amplitudes (F/F0, mean±SD: 
3.0±1.2vs 3.6±1.5, p<0.05) that was linked to reductions in sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR) Ca2+ store (F/F0, mean±SD: 3.5±1.3vs 4.4±1.3, p<0.01) measured 
with Ca2+ imaging. This was associated to lower fractional shortening in the 
cardiomyocytes from the CAIA mice (%FS, mean±SD: 3.4±2.2 vs 4.6%±2.3%, p<0.05). 
Ca2+ handling proteins displayed oxidation-dependent posttranslational 
modifications that together with an increase in superoxide dismutase expression 
indicate a cell environment with oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that inflammation during active RA has long-term 
consequences on molecular remodelling and contractile function of the heart, 
which further supports that rheumatology patients should be followed for 
development of heart failure.
