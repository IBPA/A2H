We sequenced a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a rat rheumatoid 
arthritis disease E3 strain for the first time. The total length of the 
mitogenome was 16,305â€‰bp and coding 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA 
genes, 22 transfer RNA genes. This mitochondrial genome sequence will provide 
new genetic resource into rheumatoid arthritis disease.
