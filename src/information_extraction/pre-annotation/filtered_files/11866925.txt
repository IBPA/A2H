OBJECTIVE: To identify the regulatory effect of sodium selenite and vitamin E on 
complement-neutrophil-reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activation feedback 
mechanism-mediated inflammatory response.
METHODS: The modulation of inflammatory response through the 
complement-neutrophil-ROS-activation feedback cycle with sodium selenite and 
alpha-tocopherol was verified both in vitro tests by chemiluminescense technique 
and complement fixation to detect ROS production and complement activation as 
well as in vivo mouse hepatic vasculitis models to test for the regulation of 
the inflammatory response.
RESULTS: Convincing results were observed as the incidence of hepatic vasculitis 
dropped from 100% in the control group down to 20% in the seleno-antioxidant 
vitamin E treated group, indicating down regulation of the inflammatory 
response.
CONCLUSIONS: Elucidation of the mechanism of complement mediated inflammatory 
response is a promising area for new therapeutic developments in the modulation 
of inflammatory response. This study suggests that selenium, vitamin E and other 
antioxidants may be the useful therapeutic agents in those disorders in which 
upregulation of inflammatory response has been implicated, e.g. ischemia, 
reperfusion injury, severe sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and hepatitis.
