OBJECTIVE: The complement system is important in the development of autoimmune 
inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). Complement receptor 1 (CR1) is involved in regulation of complement 
activity. Studies on models of autoimmunity have demonstrated that soluble CR1 
(sCR1) is a potent therapeutic agent. The present study was thus undertaken to 
investigate the feasibility of antiinflammatory gene therapy to prevent CIA by 
delivery of genes encoding truncated sCR1 (tsCR1) and dimeric tsCR1-Ig.
METHODS: Syngeneic fibroblasts or arthritogenic splenocytes, engineered to 
express tsCR1 using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, were injected into DBA/1 
recipients that had been immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII). In 
separate experiments, naked DNA containing tsCR1 and tsCR1-Ig genes was injected 
intramuscularly into the immunized animals. The clinical development of 
arthritis was monitored, anti-CII levels measured, and antigenic T cell response 
studied. Affinity-purified tsCR1-Ig was assayed for its inhibitory effect on the 
alternative complement pathway in mouse serum.
RESULTS: Treatment of CII-immunized mice with the tsCR1-expressing cells 
inhibited development of CIA, reduced anti-CII antibody levels, and inhibited T 
cell response to CII in vitro. Intramuscular injections of DNA encoding the CR1 
genes prevented the progression of disease. Furthermore, compared with 
full-length sCR1, purified tsCR1-Ig was more active in inhibiting the murine 
alternative complement pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that tsCR1 and tsCR1-Ig, when delivered 
via gene therapy, had a beneficial effect on autoimmune inflammation. These 
results indicate that targeting the complement system in RA patients may be of 
clinical importance.
