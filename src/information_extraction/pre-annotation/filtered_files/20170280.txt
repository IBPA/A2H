CONTEXT: VX-702 is a novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor being 
developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the renal excretion profile of VX-702 using the 
isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) model.
METHODS: Studies were performed to assess the dose linearity of VX-702 excretion 
and to evaluate the effect of inhibitors of organic anion (probenecid) and 
organic cation (cimetidine) transport systems on VX-702 disposition. VX-702 
excretion was studied over a range of doses targeting concentrations between 100 
and 600 ng/mL. VX-702 (600 ng/mL) was also co-perfused with probenecid (1 mM) 
and cimetidine (2 mM). The results were compared to parallel experiments 
performed with methotrexate (MTX).
RESULTS: VX-702 excretion was linear over the range of doses studied, and 
clearance data were consistent with net reabsorption by the kidney. Transport 
inhibition studies indicate that VX-702 is not a substrate for renal organic 
anion and organic cation transport systems. MTX (500 ng/mL) also displayed net 
reabsorption in the IPRK, but secretory transport was inhibited upon 
co-administration with probenecid. This finding is consistent with previous IPRK 
studies that demonstrated inhibitory effects of NSAIDS on MTX excretion.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study suggests that a renal drug-drug interaction 
between VX-702 and MTX would be unlikely if these medications were 
co-administered.
