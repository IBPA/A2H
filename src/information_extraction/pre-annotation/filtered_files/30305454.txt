Developing and mature chondrocytes constantly interact with and remodel the 
surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent research indicates that 
integrin-ECM interaction is differentially regulated during cartilage formation 
(chondrogenesis). Integrin signaling is also a key source of the catabolic 
reactions responsible for joint destruction in both rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis. However, we do not understand how chondrocytes dynamically 
regulate integrin signaling in such an ECM-rich environment. Here, we found that 
developing chondrocytes express integrin-β-like 1 (Itgbl1) at specific stages, 
inhibiting integrin signaling and promoting chondrogenesis. Unlike cytosolic 
integrin inhibitors, ITGBL1 is secreted and physically interacts with integrins 
to down-regulate activity. We observed that Itgbl1 expression was strongly 
reduced in the damaged articular cartilage of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). 
Ectopic expression of Itgbl1 protected joint cartilage against OA development in 
the destabilization of the medial meniscus-induced OA mouse model. Our results 
reveal ITGBL1 signaling as an underlying mechanism of protection against 
destructive cartilage disorders and suggest the potential therapeutic utility of 
targeting ITGBL1 to modulate integrin signaling in human disease.
