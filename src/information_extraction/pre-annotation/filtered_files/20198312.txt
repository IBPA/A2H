HE3286 (17alpha-ethynyl-5-androstene-3beta, 7beta, 17beta-triol) is an orally 
bio-available synthetic derivative of naturally occurring androstene-3beta, 
7beta, 17beta-triol. Our present data show that oral treatment with HE3286, 
favourably influenced the course of arthritis in the rat model of 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (reduced cumulative disease scores and paw edema), 
and in the mouse model of collagen antibody-induced arthritis (reduced clinical 
paw scores). Importantly, HE3286 was not immune suppressive in human mixed 
lymphocyte reaction or in animals challenged with Coxsackie B3 virus. HE3286 is 
currently in phase I/II clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative 
colitis and these findings further strengthen the possibility that HE3286 may 
represent an effective anti-inflammatory agent useful for treating chronic 
inflammation with a more attractive safety profile than glucocorticoids or 
cyclooxygenase inhibitors.
