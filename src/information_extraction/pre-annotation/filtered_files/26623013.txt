Tripterygium glycosides (TG) are extracted from a traditional Chinese medicinal 
herb. Using the compound, progress has been made in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), but the underlying mechanism of its action is poorly understood. 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of TG in preventing 
inflammatory arthritis. An inflammatory cell model was established in the rat 
synovial RSC-364 cell line via induction with interleukin (IL)-1β. The 
expression of IL-32 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-9) was 
determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with the control 
group (without IL-1β), IL-1β in the treatment group induced the expression of 
IL-32, MMP-1 and MMP-9 in RSC-364 cells. When a different dose of TG was added 
to RSC-364 cells stimulated with IL-1β, TG decreased the expression levels of 
IL-32, MMP-1 and MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that 
TG suppressed the inflammation response in RSC-364 cells. Taken together, these 
findings may contribute to a better understanding of the role of TG in the 
anti-inflammatory therapeutics for RA.
