BACKGROUND: The current study was intended to investigate the effect of ketamine 
(KET) on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in rats.
METHODS: The CFA was administered in the hind paw of the rats for the induction 
of adjuvant-induced arthritis. The paw swelling of experimental animals was 
measured as hind paw volume. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was estimated and 
pathological changes in the joint tissues were observed under a light 
microscope. Furthermore, the bicinchoninic acid assay was used for protein 
quantification. The antibody-reactive bands were visualized using enhanced 
chemiluminescence.
RESULTS: The present study showed that KET significantly reduces the severity of 
arthritis in CFA mice. The therapeutic effects were linked with reduced joint 
swelling and destruction, as evidenced by analyzing rat paws. The KET also 
revealed to attenuate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6). In western blot analysis, KET inhibit phosphorylation of MAPKs, 
IκBα and nuclear translocation NF-κB in the inflammatory joints of AIA rats. 
Moreover, KET showed to induce apoptosis via mitochondrial signalling pathways 
(Bcl2, Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caapse-9).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, KET show significant anti-rheumatoid arthritis 
activity via multiple mechanisms and may thus have therapeutic benefits for RA.
