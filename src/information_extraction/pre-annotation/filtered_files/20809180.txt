Many macrophage functions are modulated by fatty acids (FAs), including cytokine 
release, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TNF-α is of great interest due 
to its role in the inflammation process observed in several diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and obesity. However, the mechanisms by 
which FA effects occur have not been completely elucidated yet. In this study, 
we used a mouse monocyte lineage (J774 cells) to evaluate the effect of 50 and 
100 μM of saturated (palmitic and stearic acids), monounsaturated (oleic acid) 
and polyunsaturated (linoleic acid) FAs on TNF-α production. Alterations in gene 
expression, poly(A) tail length and activation of transcription factors were 
evaluated. Oleic and linoleic acids, usually known as neutral or 
pro-inflammatory FA, inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α secretion by the cells. 
Saturated FAs were potent inducers of TNF-α expression and secretion under basal 
and inflammatory conditions (in the presence of LPS). Although the effect of the 
saturated FA was similar, the mechanism involved in each case seem to be 
distinct, as palmitic acid increased EGR-1 and CREB binding activity and stearic 
acid increased mRNA poly(A) tail. These results may contribute to the 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which saturated FAs modulate the 
inflammatory response and may lead to design of associations of dietary and 
pharmacological strategies to counteract the pathological effects of TNF-α.
