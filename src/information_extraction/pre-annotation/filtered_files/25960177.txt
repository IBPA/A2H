Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are involved in 
initiation of immune responses to foreign antigens via presentation of peptides 
to receptors of CD4(+) T-cells. An analogous presentation of self-peptides may 
lead to autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The glycopeptide 
fragment CII259-273, derived from type II collagen, is presented by A(q) MHCII 
molecules in the mouse and has a key role in development of collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA), a validated model for RA. We have introduced hydroxyethylene 
amide bond isosteres at the Ala(261)-Gly(262) position of CII259-273. Biological 
evaluation showed that A(q) binding and T cell recognition were dramatically 
reduced for the modified glycopeptides, although static models predicted similar 
binding modes as the native type II collagen fragment. Molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations demonstrated that introduction of the hydroxyethylene isosteres 
disturbed the entire hydrogen bond network between the glycopeptides and A(q). 
As a consequence the hydroxyethylene isosteric glycopeptides were prone to 
dissociation from A(q) and unfolding of the Î²1-helix. Thus, the isostere induced 
adjustment of the hydrogen bond network altered the structure and dynamics of 
A(q)/glycopeptide complexes leading to the loss of A(q) affinity and subsequent 
T cell response.
