Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has crucial roles in the 
regulation of immune response, inflammation and hematopoiesis. Recently, a new 
inflammatory helper T cell subset which produces IL-17A (IL-17), termed Th17 
cells was identified and has been reported to be involved in the development and 
pathogenesis of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) and experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE), which are known as the mouse model of rheumatoid 
arthritis and multiple sclerosis, respectively. It has been demonstrated that 
IL-6 together with TGF-beta induces the differentiation of Th17 cells from naive 
helper T cells in vitro. However, IL-6 independent pathway of Th17 
differentiation has also been reported, suggesting that the role of IL-6 in vivo 
in these diseases remains unclear. With the treatment of anti-IL-6R antibody in 
CIA and EAE, we could suppress the differentiation of antigen specific Th17 
cells and the onset of diseases. These results indicate that IL-6 is involved in 
the induction of Th17 cells in vivo, and anti-IL-6R antibody might be a 
promising therapy of Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases.
