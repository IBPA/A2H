Biologic agents that inhibit proinflammatory cytokines have made a profound 
impact on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of the agents that are 
currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this 
indication, etanercept and infliximab neutralize tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 
and anakinra inhibits interleukin-1 (IL-1). Adalimumab, which was just recently 
approved by the FDA, is also a TNF inhibitor. Despite their common ability to 
inhibit cytokine bioactivity, the molecular structures and mechanisms of action 
of these biologic agents are significantly different. The TNF-binding moiety of 
etanercept is derived from soluble TNF receptor subunits. Infliximab is a 
chimeric (mouse-human) monoclonal antibody to TNF, while adalimumab is a fully 
human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. Anakinra has yet another mechanism of 
action: it is an IL-1 receptor antagonist. The molecular characteristics of 
these agents may be relevant to clinical efficacy and safety. These agents are 
still relatively new: to date, the longest reporting time is 5 years, for 
etanercept. Additional long-term data will be required to determine the relative 
benefits and drawbacks of different molecular characteristics in these 
anticytokine agents.
