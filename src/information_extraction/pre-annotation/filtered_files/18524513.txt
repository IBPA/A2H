AIM OF THE STUDY: To elucidate the pharmacological activities of deer antler 
acupuncture and TGF61538;1 on the acute and chronic phases of rheumatoid 
arthritis diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyarthritis rats were administered with TGF61538;1 and 
water extract of deer antler acupunture (DAA), prepared from the pilose antler 
of Cervus korean TEMMINCK var. mantchuricus Swinhoe. TGF61538; (0.1 to 2 
61549;g/animal) and DAA (5-100 61549;g/kg animal) were initiated 1 day before an 
arthritogenic dose of streptococcal cell wall fragments to see the effects on 
the joint swelling and distortion during the acute phase and the chronic phase 
of the disease. Arthritic index suppression of rat arthritis model was examined 
by TGF61538; and DAA administrations.
RESULTS: TGF61538;1 and DAA diminished the polyarthritis development in rats. 
TGF61538; and DAA eliminated the joint swelling and distortion observed during 
the acute phase and the chronic phase of the disease. The TGF61538; and DAA 
suppressed the arthritis progress when administration was begun after acute 
phase of arthritis.
DISCUSSION: Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into 
the synovium, TGF61538;1 and DAA reversed the leukocytosis associated with the 
chronic phase of the arthritis, respectively.
