OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of bizhongxiao decotion (BZXD) on the plasma 
TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in rats with C II-induced arthritis (CIA) and to explore 
the mechanism of BZXD in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: We divided 75 rats into 4 groups randomly. The rat experimented 
arthritis model was established by subcutaneous injection with collagen II. The 
plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels were detected with the radio-immunity assay 
at different time spots.
RESULTS: The incidence of arthritis in the rats immunized with C II was 
approximately 88%. The plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels of the model group, 
BZXD group and methotrexate (MTX) group were notably higher than those of the 
normal group (P < 0.05). The plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels of the model 
group were higher than those of the MTX control group and BZXD treatment group 
at different time spots (P < 0. 01). The plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels 
rose step by step, but those of the BZXD group and MTX group decreased 
gradually. Moreover, the plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels of the rats of 
BZXD group were lower than those of the MTX group (P < 0. 05).
CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha and IL-1beta play a very important role in the formation 
and development of rheumatoid arthritis. Both BZXD and MTX can notably decrease 
the plasma TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels, but the effect of BZXD is better than 
that of MTX.
