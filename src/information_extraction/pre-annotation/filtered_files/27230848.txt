Study of rare genetic disorder often provides fundamental insights into the 
pathology of common diseases. Cherubism is a rare craniofacial disorder in 
children characterized by the destruction of maxillary and mandibular bones due 
to expansile fibrous inflammatory lesions. Genetic study of cherubism families 
discovered that gain-of-function mutations in the signaling adaptor protein 
SH3BP2 are responsible for cherubism. Analysis of the mouse model revealed that 
cherubism is an autoinflammatory disorder that is caused by dysregulated 
signaling pathway mediated by toll-like receptors and spleen tyrosine kinase. 
Recent study of the SH3BP2-deficient mice showed that SH3BP2 plays important 
roles in bone resorption in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis. These 
results establish SH3BP2 as a key player in the osteoimmune system beyond its 
role in a rare inherited disorder and suggest that the signaling pathway 
mediated by SH3BP2 is involved in the pathogenesis of common inflammatory bone 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
