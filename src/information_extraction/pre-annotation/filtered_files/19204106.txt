Antibodies to citrulline-modified proteins have a high diagnostic value in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their biological role in disease development 
is still unclear. To obtain insight into this question, a panel of mouse 
monoclonal antibodies was generated against a major triple helical collagen type 
II (CII) epitope (position 359-369; ARGLTGRPGDA) with or without arginines 
modified by citrullination. These antibodies bind cartilage and synovial tissue, 
and mediate arthritis in mice. Detection of citrullinated CII from RA patients' 
synovial fluid demonstrates that cartilage-derived CII is indeed citrullinated 
in vivo. The structure determination of a Fab fragment of one of these 
antibodies in complex with a citrullinated peptide showed a surprising beta-turn 
conformation of the peptide and provided information on citrulline recognition. 
Based on these findings, we propose that autoimmunity to CII, leading to the 
production of antibodies specific for both native and citrullinated CII, is an 
important pathogenic factor in the development of RA.
