OBJECTIVE: The use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in rheumatoid arthritis is limited 
by side effects related to unfavorable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. 
Liposomal GC formulations have been studied since the 1970s in an attempt to 
overcome this obstacle, but none has entered clinical use. We undertook this 
study to determine whether a novel approach could overcome the limitations that 
have thus far prevented the clinical use of these formulations: low drug:lipid 
ratio, low encapsulation efficiency, and lack of controlled release.
METHODS: We used approximately 80-nm sterically stabilized (pegylated) 
nanoliposomes (NSSLs), which were remote-loaded with an amphipathic weak acid GC 
(such as methyl prednisolone hemisuccinate) utilizing an intraliposome (aqueous 
compartment)-high/extraliposome (bulk medium)-low transmembrane calcium acetate 
gradient. This unique method actually "traps" the GC in the liposomal aqueous 
phase as a calcium-GC precipitate.
RESULTS: Our liposome formulation exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (94%) 
and a high drug:lipid mole ratio (0.41) and demonstrated controlled release of 
the encapsulated GC during systemic circulation and in inflamed paws in rats 
with adjuvant-induced arthritis. In addition, both in arthritic rats and in a 
Beagle dog, we showed the pharmacokinetic advantage of using liposomes as GC 
carriers. Finally, we demonstrated the superior therapeutic efficacy of our 
liposome formulation over that of free GCs in arthritic rats, both in early and 
in peak disease stages.
CONCLUSION: Amphipathic weak acid GCs remote-loaded into approximately 80-nm 
NSSLs overcome past limitations of liposomal GC formulations. The unique loading 
method, which also leads to controlled release, improves the therapeutic effect 
both systemically and locally. Such a development has great potential for 
improving GC therapy.
