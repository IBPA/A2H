We designed new oral formulations containing indomethacin (IMC) solid 
nanoparticles, and investigate their usefulness by evaluating bioavailability 
and gastrointestinal lesions. The IMC solid nanoparticles were prepared using 
methylcellulose (MC), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), and the bead mill 
method, and high quality dispersions containing 1.0% IMC nanoparticles were 
prepared (IMC(nano), particle size: 76 ± 58 nm, means ± S.D.). The fate of serum 
IMC and the induction of paw edema in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rats 
receiving low-doses IMC(nano) (0.4 mg/kg) were similar to those following the 
administration of a therapeutic dose of conventional IMC prepared with MC and 
HPβCD (conventional IMC, 2 mg/kg), and the bioavailability in 0.4 mg/kg 
IMC(nano) was 5.3-fold higher in comparison with that in 2 mg/kg conventional 
IMC. IMC-induced gastrointestinal lesions in AA rats administered IMC(nano) (8 
mg/kg), in consideration of bioavailability, were significantly less than for 
conventional IMC (40 mg/kg). On the other hand, the toxicity caused by 
conventional IMC and IMC(nano) was similar in Caco-2 cells. It is possible that 
the oral administration of IMC solid nanoparticles will show increased 
effectiveness in treating RA without causing IMC-induced gastrointestinal 
lesions, since the bioavailability is higher than that of conventional IMC. An 
oral drug delivery system using drug nanoparticles may expand the usage of 
NSAIDs for therapy in the inflammatory field.
