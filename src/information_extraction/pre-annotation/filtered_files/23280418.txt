OBJECTIVE: To investigate how tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibiting therapy 
affects bone destruction and inflammation in a TNF-driven mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: In order to evaluate the influence of TNF on osteoclastogenesis in 
vitro, different concentrations of TNF were added to spleen cell-derived 
monocytes in the absence or presence of different concentrations of RANKL. In 
addition, the effects of TNF inhibition on osteoclast precursors as well as 
local bone destruction in vivo were assessed by treating TNF-transgenic mice 
with different doses of adalimumab.
RESULTS: TNF stimulated osteoclastogenesis mainly by increasing the number of 
osteoclast precursor cells in vitro. This TNF effect was independent of the 
presence of RANKL. In the hTNF-transgenic mouse model of destructive arthritis, 
low-dose TNF-inhibiting therapy with adalimumab had no effect on synovial 
inflammation but significantly inhibited local bone destruction and the 
generation of osteoclasts. This inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in the 
number of c-Fms-positive osteoclast precursor cells in the bone marrow and a 
reduction of the osteoclast precursor pools in the blood and inflamed synovial 
membrane of hTNF-transgenic mice.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose TNF-inhibiting therapy significantly reduces bone erosions 
by reducing the number of circulating and joint-invading osteoclast precursors. 
This effect is uncoupled from its antiinflammatory action.
