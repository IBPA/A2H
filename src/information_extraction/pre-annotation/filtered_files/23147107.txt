In addition to the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, 
interleukin-6 and interleukin-1ß, the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) is 
considered an important mediator of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. Because tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1ß have the potential 
to influence the expression of transduction molecules such as transient receptor 
potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and thus to 
contribute to pain we explored in the present study whether IL-17A activates DRG 
neurons and influences the expression of TRPV1. The IL-17A receptor was 
visualized in most neurons in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sections as well as in 
cultured DRG neurons. Upon long-term exposure to IL-17A, isolated and cultured 
rat DRG neurons showed a significant upregulation of extracellular-regulated 
kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB). Long-term exposure of neurons to 
IL-17A did not upregulate the expression of TRPV1. However, we found a 
pronounced upregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) 
which is considered a candidate transduction molecule for mechanical 
hyperalgesia. Upon the injection of zymosan into the paw, IL-17A-deficient mice 
showed less mechanical hyperalgesia than wild type mice but thermal hyperalgesia 
was not attenuated in IL-17A-deficient mice. These data show, therefore, a 
particular role of IL-17 in mechanical hyperalgesia, and they suggest that this 
effect is linked to an activation and upregulation of TRPV4.
