OBJECTIVE: To evaluate any additive effect on attenuation of collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA) in tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRI) and interleukin 6 
(IL-6) double knockout (DKO) mice.
METHODS: CIA was induced in wild-type (Wt), TNFRI knockout (TNFRIKO), IL-6 
knockout (IL-6KO), and DKO mice. Comparative studies were performed among these 
different mouse genotypes observing clinical (incidence, arthritis score), 
histological, radiologic, and immunological aspects.
RESULTS: More than 90% of the Wt, TNFRIKO, and IL-6KO mice developed definite 
CIA, while only 20% of the DKO mice did so. Severity of arthritis, indicated by 
the arthritis score, was significantly reduced in both the TNFRIKO and IL-6KO 
mice compared with the Wt mice. Moreover, the severity of arthritis in the DKO 
mice was significantly reduced compared with each single KO mouse (by arthritis 
scores; DKO vs TNFRIKO, IL-6KO mice, p < 0.05). In addition, histological and 
radiologic changes were also significantly reduced in the DKO mice compared with 
each single KO mouse (by histological and radiologic scores; DKO vs TNFRIKO, 
IL-6KO mice, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively). In immunological studies, 
serum anti-type II collagen (anti-CII) antibody concentrations were 
significantly decreased in the DKO mice compared with each single KO mouse (DKO 
vs TNFRIKO, IL-6KO mice, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Simultaneous blockade of TNFRI and IL-6 showed synergistic rather 
than additive effects on the attenuation of CIA. Combinations of anti-TNF-a and 
anti-IL-6 therapy may provide clinical benefits for treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis compared with therapy against each single cytokine.
