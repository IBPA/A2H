Quantifying the bone erosion in preclinical models of rheumatoid arthritis is 
valuable for the evaluation of drug treatments. This study introduces a 
three-dimensional method for bone surface roughness measurement from 
micro-computed tomographic data obtained from rats subjected to collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA), in which the degree of bone erosion is related to the severity 
and the duration of the disease. In two studies of rat CIA, the surface 
roughness of the talus bone following 21 days of disease increased 559% and 486% 
from the control group. At 41 days following disease induction, the roughness of 
the bone surface increased 857% above baseline. The roughness of the control 
samples was similar from each study (less than 4% different), demonstrating the 
robustness of the algorithm. Treatment with methotrexate at 0.1 mg/kg daily 
demonstrated significant protection from bone erosion, whereas the 0.05 mg/kg 
daily dose was not efficacious (98% versus 22% inhibition of roughness-measured 
bone erosion). The main advantage of such an algorithm is demonstrated in the 
preclinical drug study of rat CIA with methotrexate treatment, indicating the 
immediate utility of this approach in drug development studies.
