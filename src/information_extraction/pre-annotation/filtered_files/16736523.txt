OBJECTIVE: The advent of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking drugs has provided 
rheumatologists with an effective, but highly expensive, treatment for the 
management of established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our aim was to explore 
preclinically the application of camelid anti-TNF VHH proteins, which are 
single-domain antigen binding (VHH) proteins homologous to human immunoglobulin 
V(H) domains, as TNF antagonists in a mouse model of RA.
METHODS: Llamas were immunized with human and mouse TNF, and antagonistic 
anti-TNF VHH proteins were isolated and cloned for bacterial production. The 
resulting anti-TNF VHH proteins were recombinantly linked to yield bivalent 
mouse and human TNF-specific molecules. To increase the serum half-life and 
targeting properties, an anti-serum albumin anti-TNF VHH domain was incorporated 
into the bivalent molecules. The TNF-neutralizing potential was analyzed in 
vitro. Mouse TNF-specific molecules were tested in a therapeutic protocol in 
murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Disease progression was evaluated by 
clinical scoring and histologic evaluation. Targeting properties were evaluated 
by 99mTc labeling and gamma camera imaging.
RESULTS: The bivalent molecules were up to 500 times more potent than the 
monovalent molecules. The antagonistic potency of the anti-human TNF VHH 
proteins exceeded even that of the anti-TNF antibodies infliximab and adalimumab 
that are used clinically in RA. Incorporation of binding affinity for albumin 
into the anti-TNF VHH protein significantly prolonged its serum half-life and 
promoted its targeting to inflamed joints in the murine CIA model of RA. This 
might explain the excellent therapeutic efficacy observed in vivo.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that because of the flexibility of their format, 
camelid anti-TNF VHH proteins can be converted into potent therapeutic agents 
that can be produced and purified cost-effectively.
