YM-58483/BTP2 is a blocker of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which regulates 
the activation of non-excitable cells such as lymphocytes. YM-58483 has been 
reported to inhibit cytokine production and proliferation in T cells, and to be 
useful as a probable medicinal candidate for treatment of bronchial asthma. The 
present study investigated the pharmacological profile and therapeutic potential 
of YM-58483 in relation to cell-mediated immune responses. In the mouse 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, YM-58483 (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.) and 
cyclosporine A (1-30 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited donor anti-host cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte (CTL) activity and IFN-gamma production, and also reduced the number 
of donor T cells, especially donor CD8+ T cells, in the spleen. YM-58483 and 
cyclosporine A inhibited T cell proliferation in a one-way mixed lymphocyte 
reaction (MLR) with IC50 values of 330 and 12.7 nM, respectively. Additionally, 
YM-58483 (1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) and cyclosporine A (2, 10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the 
sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
response. These results suggest that the inhibition of SOCE leads to the 
prevention of antigen-induced T cell responses, which participate in autoimmune 
diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis.
