Novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis also include the use of naturally 
occurring compounds possessing antioxidant properties. In the present work, the 
effects of oral administration of quercetin were investigated in a rat model of 
adjuvant arthritis. Arthritis was induced by a single intradermal injection of 
heat-inactivated Mycobacterium butyricum in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The 
experimental groups were treated with an oral daily dose of 150 mg/kg b.w. of 
quercetin for 28 days. Results indicated that quercetin was able to ameliorate 
all markers of inflammation and oxidative stress measured. Quercetin lowered 
levels of interleukin-1β, C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 
and restored plasma antioxidant capacity. In addition, quercetin inhibited the 
enzymatic activity of pro-inflammatory 12/15-lipoxygenase in lung and liver and 
increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 in joint and lung of arthritic 
rats. Finally, quercetin inhibited the 2-fold increase of NF-қB activity 
observed in lung, liver and joint after induction of arthritis.
