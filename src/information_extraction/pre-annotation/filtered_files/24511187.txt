BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that 
involves inflammation and pain of the joints. Light-Emitting Diode (LED) 
irradiation is being evaluated for treating RA; however, the mechanism is 
unclear. Monocyte chemotaxis protein (MCP)-1 is a key chemokine in the 
inflammatory status of RA, and MCP-1 levels in plasma are described as a marker 
for joint inflammation in RA.
AIM: To understand the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of LED 
irradiation on RA, the expression of MCP-1 was examined in the knee joints of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rats were immunized with type II collagen and CIA 
development was confirmed. CIA rat joints were irradiated with LED energy (3 
sessions/week, 2 weeks. 840 nm, 2 J/cm(2)). Total RNA was isolated from the rat 
knee joint tissues and the MCP-1 mRNA levels were monitored with the reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique and real-time PCR. 
MCP-1 production in the rat knee joints was analyzed immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MCP-1 mRNA levels had increased in 
CIA animals when compared to controls, and LED irradiation significant reduced 
the gene expression in CIA rats. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed a significant 
reduction in MCP-1 gene expression. The immunohistochemical analysis 
demonstrated strong MCP-1 staining in CIA rat joint synovial membrane tissue, 
and LED irradiation significantly reduced the staining.
DISCUSSION: Since MCP-1 has been identified as an important chemokine in the 
pathogenesis of RA, the reduction of MCP-1 expression would appear to be one of 
the mechanisms in the reduction of inflammation by LED irradiation.
CONCLUSION: LED irradiation reduced RA-related inflammation through the 
reduction of MCP-1 gene expression in CIA rat knee joint synovial tissue.
