Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine and a contributing factor in many 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman's disease, Crohn's disease, and 
multiple myeloma. Since the blockade of the signaling pathway of the 
IL-6/interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R)/gp130 complex is considered to have 
therapeutic value in such diseases, we developed an IL-6R humanized antibody 
(tocilizumab). In the current report, distribution of IL-6R in both normal human 
and cynomolgus monkey tissues was assessed as fundamental data to support 
preclinical and clinical studies of tocilizumab. Human and cynomolgus monkey 
tissue panels were stained with commercially available anti-human IL-6R and a 
species- and isotype-matched negative antibody, as well as assay control slides. 
The detection system applied used an Envision immunoperoxidase staining 
procedure with DAB reaction. Positive reactions were observed in the tissue 
elements of lymphatic, hematopoietic, digestive, reproductive, exocrine, 
endocrine, neural, muscular, epidermal, respiratory, and urinary systems of the 
human and cynomolgus monkey tissue panels. The current report is inclusive of a 
wide variety of tissues and shows the distribution of IL-6R to be similar for 
both human and monkey tissues. We consider this information fundamental for the 
support and interpretation of preclinical and clinical studies of anti-IL-6R 
antibody therapy.
