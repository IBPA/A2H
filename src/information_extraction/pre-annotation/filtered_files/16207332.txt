Antibodies against type II collagen (CII) are important in the development of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and possibly also in rheumatoid arthritis. We 
have determined the fine specificity and arthritogenicity of the antibody 
response to CII in chronic relapsing variants of CIA. Immunization with rat CII 
in B10.Q or B10.Q(BALB/cxB10.Q)F2 mice induces a chronic relapsing CIA. The 
antibody response to CII was determined by using triple-helical peptides of the 
major B cell epitopes. Each individual mouse had a unique epitope-specific 
response and this epitope predominance shifted distinctly during the course of 
the disease. In the B10.Q mice the antibodies specific for C1 and U1, and in the 
B10.Q(BALB/cxB10.Q)F2 mice the antibodies specific for C1, U1 and J1, correlated 
with the development of chronic arthritis. Injection of monoclonal antibodies 
against these epitopes induced relapses in chronic arthritic mice. The 
development of chronic relapsing arthritis, initially induced by CII 
immunization, is associated with an arthritogenic antibody response to certain 
CII epitopes.
