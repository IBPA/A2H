The present study was aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effect of triphala 
and its underlying mechanism on adjuvant-induced rat model. For comparison 
purpose, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin was used. Arthritis 
was induced by intradermal injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (0.1 ml) into 
the right hind paw of the Wistar albino rats. Triphala (100 mg/kg body weight 
[bwt]) was administered intraperitoneally (from 11th to 20th day) after the 
arthritis induction. Arthritis induction increased the levels of reactive oxygen 
species (LPO and NO), elastase, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-β, IL-17, IL-6 and MCP-1), inflammatory marker enzymes 
(iNOS and COX-2), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), 
and transcription factors (NF-kB p65 and AP-1) in the paw tissues of rats. The 
levels of bone collagen were found to decrease with increased urinary 
constituents (hydroxyproline and total glycosaminoglycans) in arthritic rats. In 
addition, the immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased expression of 
NF-kBp65 and COX-2 in the paw tissues of arthritic rats. However, administration 
of triphala significantly inhibited the biochemical and molecular alterations in 
adjuvant-induced arthritic rats compared to indomethacin (3 mg/kg bwt) as 
evidenced by the radiological and histopathological analysis. In conclusion, our 
results suggest that triphala administration ameliorate bone and cartilage 
degradation during rheumatoid arthritis.
