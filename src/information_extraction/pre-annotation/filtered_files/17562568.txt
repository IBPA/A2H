Withania somnifera (WS) is an important herb with known antiinflammatory 
activity. Its molecular mechanism of action has not been investigated. The 
effect of a WS crude ethanol extract was studied on peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells of normal individuals and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and synovial 
fluid mononuclear cells of RA patients in vitro. The WS extract significantly 
suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced production of proinflammatory 
cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12p40 in normal individuals and RA 
patients, but had no effect on IL-6 production at the protein and transcript 
level. WS also suppressed LPS activated nitric oxide production in the mouse 
macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. The extract inhibited nuclear translocation of 
the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 and phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha 
in normal and RA patients' mononuclear cells. HPLC analysis of the crude extract 
showed the presence of withaferin A and pure withaferin A also inhibited 
NF-kappaB translocation. The study demonstrated that the WS crude ethanol 
extract suppressed the production of proinflammatory molecules in vitro. This 
activity is partly through the inhibition of transcription factors NF-kappaB and 
AP-1 by the constituent withanolide. The role of additional constituents needs 
to be studied. Studies on the mechanism of action of the extract may yield 
potentially useful compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
