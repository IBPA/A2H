The early phase of cartilage degeneration was immunohistochemically examined in 
order to clarify the importance of autoimmune reaction against type II collagen 
in MRL/Mp- lpr/lpr (MRL/ l) mouse in an experimental model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Anti-type II collagen antibodies were detectable in 3-week-old 
mice and preceded the appearance of rheumatoid factors. Furthermore, mesenchymal 
cells and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells began to accumulate 
remarkably in the periphysis, a fibrochondro-osseous area in the bone marrow 
vicinity. The numbers of these cells increased with mice age, together with 
serum levels of anti-type II collagen antibodies. Immunostaining of the 
periphysis revealed expression of type II collagen, IgG, C3, Mac-3, MHC class II 
antigen Ia, and cathepsin-L. Osteoclast-like cells and macrophage infiltration 
into the lesion area were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The 
results indicate that cartilage degeneration in MRL/ l mouse may originate in 
the periphysis and progress via a pathway independent of synovial invasion.
