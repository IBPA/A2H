Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease mainly 
affecting synovial joints. The clinical presentation of RA shows the 
heterogeneity of this disease with its underlying complex interactions between 
the innate and adaptive immune system and flare-ups of disease. Different 
disease models such as collagen induced arthritis, antigen induced arthritis, 
and Streptococcal cell wall induced arthritis can be exploited to investigate 
different aspects of the pathogenesis of arthritis. The disease can be monitored 
macroscopically over time via scoring systems. For histological examination, 
paraffin embedded knee sections can be used for hematoxylin and eosin staining 
to visualize cellular infiltration as well as for tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP) staining to identify osteoclast-like cells. Cellular 
infiltration of the synovium by different myeloid cells such as tissue resident 
macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils can be monitored using flow 
cytometry. Here, we describe the methods for inducing the different mouse models 
for arthritis, including scoring systems per model, histological and flow 
cytometric analysis.
