Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibits high remission rates after initial 
chemoimmunotherapy, but with relapses with treatment, refractory disease is the 
most common outcome, especially in CLL with the deletion of chromosome 11q or 
17p. In addressing the need of treatments for relapsed disease, we report the 
identification of an existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved 
small-molecule drug to repurpose for CLL treatment. Auranofin (Ridaura) is 
approved for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but it exhibited preclinical 
efficacy in CLL cells. By inhibiting thioredoxin reductase activity and 
increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, auranofin induced a 
lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response in cultured and primary CLL cells. 
In addition, auranofin displayed synergistic lethality with heme oxygenase-1 and 
glutamate-cysteine ligase inhibitors against CLL cells. Auranofin overcame 
apoptosis resistance mediated by protective stromal cells, and it also killed 
primary CLL cells with deletion of chromosome 11q or 17p. In TCL-1 transgenic 
mice, an in vivo model of CLL, auranofin treatment markedly reduced tumor cell 
burden and improved mouse survival. Our results provide a rationale to 
reposition the approved drug auranofin for clinical evaluation in the therapy of 
CLL.
