BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Translational animal models are essential in the 
prediction of the efficacy and side effects of new chemical entities. We have 
carried out a thorough study of three distinct disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in the rat and 
critically appraised the results in the context of the reported clinical 
experience in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Teriflunomide - a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) 
inhibitor; AL8697 - a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor; and tofacitinib - a Janus 
kinase (JAK) inhibitor; were selected as representatives of their class and 
dose-response studies carried out using a therapeutic 10-day administration 
scheme in arthritic rats. Paw swelling and body weight were periodically 
monitored, and joint radiology and histology, lymph organ weight and 
haematological and biochemical parameters evaluated at study completion.
KEY RESULTS: All three drugs demonstrated beneficial effects on paw swelling, 
bone lesions and splenomegalia, with p38 inhibition providing the best 
anti-inflammatory effect and JAK inhibition the best DMARD effect. Leukopenia, 
body weight loss and gastrointestinal toxicity were dose-dependently observed 
with teriflunomide treatment. p38 MAPK inhibition induced leukocytosis and 
increased total plasma cholesterol. JAK inhibition, normalized platelet, 
reticulocyte and neutrophil counts, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
while inducing lymphopenia and cholesterolemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This multiparametric approach can reveal specific 
drug properties and provide translational information. Whereas the complex 
profile for p38 inhibition in AIA is not observed in human RA, 
immunosuppressants such as DHODH and JAK inhibitors show DMARD properties and 
side effects seen in both AIA and RA.
