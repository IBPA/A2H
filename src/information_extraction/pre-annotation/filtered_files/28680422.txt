We recently reported that the intraperitoneal inoculation of Lactobacillus 
helveticus SBT2171 inhibited the development of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA), a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the present study, we 
evaluated the effect of the oral administration of L. helveticus SBT2171 on CIA 
development and on the regulation of antigen-specific antibody production and 
inflammatory immune cells, which have been implicated in the development of RA. 
Both oral administration and intraperitoneal inoculation of L. helveticus 
SBT2171 reduced joint swelling, body weight loss, and the serum level of bovine 
type II collagen (CII)-specific antibodies in the CIA mouse model. The 
intraperitoneal inoculation also decreased the arthritis incidence, joint 
damage, and serum level of interleukin (IL)-6. In addition, the numbers of total 
immune cells, total B cells, germinal center B cells, and CD4+ T cells in the 
draining lymph nodes were decreased following intraperitoneal inoculation of L. 
helveticus SBT2171. These findings demonstrate the ability of L. helveticus 
SBT2171 to downregulate the abundance of immune cells and the subsequent 
production of CII-specific antibodies and IL-6, thereby suppressing the CIA 
symptoms, indicating its potential for use in the prevention of RA.
