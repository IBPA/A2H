The object of this study is to observe the effects of platycodin D, a saponin 
purified from Platycodi Radix, on mice collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). A daily 
dose of 200, 100, and 50 mg/kg platycodin D was administered orally to male 
DBA/1J mice for 40 days after initial collagen immunization. To ascertain the 
effects administering the collagen booster, CIA-related features (including body 
weight, poly-arthritis, knee and paw thickness, and paw weight increase) was 
measured from histopathological changes in the spleen, left popliteal lymph 
node, third digit, and the knee joint regions. CIA-related bone and cartilage 
damage improved significantly in the platycodin D-administered CIA mice. 
Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in the paw were reduced in platycodin 
D-treated CIA mice compared to CIA control groups. The level of malondialdehyde 
(MDA), an indicator of oxidative stress, decreased in a dose-dependent manner in 
the platycodin D group. Finally, the production of IL-6 and TNF- α , involved in 
rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis, was suppressed by treatment with platycodin 
D. Taken together, these results suggest that platycodin D is a promising new 
effective antirheumatoid arthritis agent, exerting anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidative and immunomodulatory effects in CIA mice.
