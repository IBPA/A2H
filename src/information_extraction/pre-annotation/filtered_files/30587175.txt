BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and refractory autoimmune 
joint disease. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) produce inflammatory cytokines 
and are involved in the migration and invasion of panuus tissue, which leads to 
the destruction of joints in RA. Receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility 
(RHAMM), is known to be one of the important receptors for hyaluronic acid. It 
has the ability to regulate migration of fibrocytes and infiltration of 
inflammatory cells. Here,we explored the mechanisms of RHAMM in RAFs.
METHODS: Quantitative PCR and western blot were performed to test the expression 
of RHAMM in synoviocytes of RA patients and osteoarthritis (OA) controls. 
Collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) was used to investigate the RHAMM 
expression in mouse synovial issues. RHAMM siRNA was used to detect the function 
of RHAMM in FLS.
RESULTS: RA-FLS has a significantly higher expression of RHAMM than OA-FLS. 
Expression of RHAMM in joint synovial tissue was markedly increased in the CAIA 
mice compared with the controls. RHAMM silencing using SiRNA was not only 
decreased the production of IL-6 and IL-8, but also inhibited the migration and 
invasion of RA-FLS.
CONCLUSIONS: RHAMM has an important role in the FLS induced modulation of 
inflammation and destruction of joints in RA.
