AIM: To assess diagnostic informative value of specific autoantibodies 
(AAB)--antikeratin antibodies (AKA), antiperinuclear factor (APF) and antibodies 
to cyclic peptide containing citrullin (CCP) from the family of antifilaggrine 
autoantibodies (AFA)--in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients with RA and 45 patients with 
seronegative spondylarthropathies. Rheumatoid factor was detected with latex 
agglutination. AKA and APF were estimated with indirect immunofluorescence the 
substrate of which was series frozen sections of rat esophagus in the middle 
third of 4 mcm and cells of the epithelium of the internal surface of healthy 
donor's cheek. For detection of antibodies to cyclic peptide, the test DIASTAT 
Anti-CCP ELISA (Axis Shield, Great Britain) was made.
RESULTS: The RF was detected in 67.8% patients with RA; AKA, APF and antibodies 
to CCP--in 43.6, 52.9 and 68.0% patients, respectively. AKA were most specific 
for RA (100%) while the RF was least specific among the AAB studied (87%). 
Simultaneous use of RF and AFA allows AAB detection in 84% RA patients at early 
stages of the disease. AFA were detected in patients with high 
clinico-laboratory activity of the process, high indices of functional joint 
insufficiency. 95% of all cases of destructive arthritis were detected in 
patients with RF, AKA, APF and antibodies to CCP.
CONCLUSION: For RA patients it is necessary to determine both RF and AFA. 
Detection of AFA allows early diagnosis of RA as well as to single out patients 
with more aggressive course of the disease and unfavourable prognosis.
