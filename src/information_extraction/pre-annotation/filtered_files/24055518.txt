Polyphenols from red fruits and bee-derived propolis (PR) are bioactive natural 
products in various in vitro and in vivo models. The present study shows that 
hematotoxicity-free doses of grape polyphenols (GPE) and PR differentially 
decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from activated human 
peripheral blood leucocytes. While GPE inhibited the monocytes/macrophage 
response, propolis decreased both monokines and interferon γ (IFNγ) production. 
When used together, their distinct effects lead to the attenuation of all 
inflammatory mediators, as supported by a significant modulation of the 
transcriptomic profile of pro-inflammatory genes in human leukocytes. To enforce 
in vitro data, GPE+PR were tested for their ability to improve clinical scores 
and cachexia in chronic rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA). Extracts 
significantly reduced arthritis scores and cachexia, and this effect was more 
significant in animals receiving continuous low doses compared to those 
receiving five different high doses. Animals treated daily had significantly 
better clinical scores than corticoid-treated rats. Together, these findings 
indicate that the GPE+PR combination induces potent anti-inflammatory activity 
due to their complementary immune cell modulation.
