Osteoclasts are responsible for bone erosion in diseases as diverse as 
osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Antifungal products have 
received recent attention as potential therapeutic and preventative drugs in 
human disease. Since little is known about the action of miconazole, an 
antifungal imidazole, on bone metabolism, we investigated the effects of 
miconazole on osteoclast formation using mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). 
Miconazole inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent 
manner without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, miconazole inhibited the bone 
resorptive activity of osteoclasts. Miconazole suppressed RANKL-induced 
expression of c-Fos and NFATc1, two essential transcription factors for 
osteoclast differentiation. Miconazole seemed to inhibit osteoclast formation 
MAPK pathways as well as Blimp1 through MafB expression. Miconazole also 
inhibited RANKL-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX-2 and 
iNOS. In accordance with the in vitro study, miconazole reduced 
lipopolysaccharide-induced osteoclast formation in vivo. Therefore, miconazole 
exerted an inhibitory effect on osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. It 
could be useful for the treatment of bone diseases associated with excessive 
bone resorption.
