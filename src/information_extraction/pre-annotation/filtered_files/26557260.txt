Rituximab (RTX), a mouse/human chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 monoclonal antibody has 
been effectively used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy 
regimen to treat lymphoma since 1997. In addition, it has been used to treat 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Recently, RTX has also been 
suggested for the treatment of certain connective tissue disease-related 
interstitial lung diseases (ILD) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Rare but 
serious pulmonary adverse reactions are reported. To raise awareness about this 
serious side effect of RTX treatment, as the indication for its use increases 
with time, we report five cases of probable RTX-ILD and discuss the current 
literature on this potentially lethal association.
