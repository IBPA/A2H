Zoledronate, a third-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, is a new 
therapeutic agent for the prevention of joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Due to the poor oral absorption of zoledronate, the intravenous 
route has been the preferred method of administration. To evaluate whether the 
lung is a promising alternative route of zoledronate administration for the 
prevention of joint destruction in RA, we examined the pharmacokinetics, safety 
and therapeutic potential of zoledronate after intrapulmonary administration. 
The bioavailability of zoledronate was 55% after intrapulmonary administration 
in rats. In a collagen-induced RA mouse model, an intrapulmonary administration 
of zoledronate given 7 d before the 2nd collagen immunization effectively 
suppressed bone loss and joint destruction to a level similar to that achieved 
with intravenous injection at 21 d after the 2nd collagen immunization. 
Zoledronate only slightly affected lactate dehydrogenase activity in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 4 h after intrapulmonary administration of the 
therapeutic dose in rats. Moreover, zoledronate only slightly changed the plasma 
level of creatinine after intrapulmonary administration while creatinine 
significantly increased after intravenous injection of zoledronate in mice. 
These results indicate that the lung is a promising alternative route of 
zoledronate administration for the treatment and prevention of joint destruction 
in RA.
