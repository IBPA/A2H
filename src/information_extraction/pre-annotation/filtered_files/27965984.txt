The aim of this study was to explore the possible mechanism of rheumatoid 
arthritis- (RA-) related abnormal glucose metabolism. The model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was established by intradermal injection of 
type II collagen into Wistar rats; complete Freund's adjuvant injections were 
used as the control group. Fasting plasma glucose (FBG) was measured by the 
glucose oxidase method. Fasting insulin (FIns) and the expressions of IL-6 were 
detected by ELISA. Islet caspase-3 was examined by immunohistochemistry. On day 
17 after immunization, FBG of the CIA group showed an elevated FBG value 
compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the FIns of group CIA was lower when 
compared with the control group. Interestingly, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 
expression was significantly increased when compared with the control group. As 
expected, the abnormal glucose metabolism was accompanied by the increased IL-6 
expression. Furthermore, in line with the upregulated IL-6 expression, the 
apoptosis related enzyme caspase-3 was also markedly increased. These data 
showed that the elevated FBG in CIA may be associated with the reduced FIns 
level secondary to the overapoptosis of pancreas islet cells induced by IL-6.
