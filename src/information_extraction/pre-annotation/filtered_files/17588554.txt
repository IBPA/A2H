BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent and debilitating disease 
that affects the joints. Infiltration of blood-derived cells in the affected 
joints upon activation generate reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, resulting in 
an oxidative stress. One approach to counteract this oxidative stress is the use 
of antioxidants as therapeutic agents.
OBJECTIVES: Kalpaamruthaa (KA), a modified indigenous Siddha preparation 
constituting Semecarpus anacardium nut milk extract (SA), Emblica officinalis 
(EO) and honey was evaluated for its synergistic antioxidant potential in 
adjuvant induced arthritic rats than sole SA treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Levels/activities of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS), myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxide and 
enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were determined in control, arthritis 
induced, SA and KA treated (150 mg/kg b.wt.) animals.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The levels/activities of ROS/RNS, myeloperoxidase and 
lipid peroxide were increased significantly (p<0.05) and the activities of 
enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants were in turn decreased in arthritic rats, 
whereas these changes were reverted to near normal levels upon SA and KA 
treatment. KA showed an enhanced antioxidant potential than sole treatment of SA 
in adjuvant induced arthritic rats. KA via enhancing the antioxidant status in 
adjuvant induced arthritic rats than sole SA treatment proves to be an important 
therapeutic modality in the management of RA and thereby instituting the role of 
oxidative stress in the clinical manifestation of the disease RA. The profound 
antioxidant efficacy of KA than SA alone might be due to the synergistic action 
of the polyphenols such as flavonoids, tannins and other compounds such as 
vitamin C and hydroxycinnamates present in KA.
