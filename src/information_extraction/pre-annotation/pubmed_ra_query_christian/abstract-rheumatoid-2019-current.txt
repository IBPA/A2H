PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the pathogenic association between periodontal 
disease and rheumatoid arthritis focusing on the role of Porphyromonas 
gingivalis.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the last decades our knowledge about the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis substantially changed. Several evidences demonstrated that 
the initial production of autoantibodies is not localized in the joint, rather 
in other immunological-active sites. A central role seems to be played by 
periodontal disease, in particular because of the ability of P. gingivalis to 
induce citrullination, the posttranslational modification leading to the 
production of anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies, the most sensitive 
and specific rheumatoid arthritis biomarker.
SUMMARY: The pathogenic role of P. gingivalis has been demonstrated in mouse 
models in which arthritis was either triggered or worsened in infected animals. 
P. gingivalis showed its detrimental role not only by inducing citrullination 
but also by means of other key mechanisms including induction of NETosis, 
osteoclastogenesis, and Th17 proinflammatory response leading to bone damage and 
systemic inflammation.

IL-17-producing T helper (Th17) cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Targeting the effector cytokines 
IL-17 and GM-CSF secreted by autoimmune Th17 cells has been shown to be 
effective for the treatment of the diseases. Understanding a molecular basis of 
Th17 differentiation and effector functions is therefore critical for the 
regulation of the pathogenicity of tissue Th17 cells in chronic inflammation. 
Here, we discuss the roles of proinflammatory cytokines and environmental 
stimuli in the control of Th17 differentiation and chronic tissue inflammation 
by pathogenic Th17 cells in humans and in mouse models of autoimmune diseases. 
We also highlight recent advances in the regulation of pathogenic Th17 cells by 
gut microbiota and immunometabolism in autoimmune arthritis.

Rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been used over decades to study 
the immunopathogenesis of the disease and to explore intervention strategies. 
Nevertheless, mouse models of RA reach their limit when it comes to testing of 
new therapeutic approaches such as cell-based therapies. Differences between the 
human and the murine immune system make it difficult to draw reliable 
conclusions about the success of immunotherapies. To overcome this issue, 
humanized mouse models have been established that mimic components of the human 
immune system in mice. Two main strategies have been pursued for humanization: 
the introduction of human transgenes such as human leukocyte antigen molecules 
or specific T cell receptors, and the generation of mouse/human chimera by 
transferring human cells or tissues into immunodeficient mice. Recently, both 
approaches have been combined to achieve more sophisticated humanized models of 
autoimmune diseases. This review discusses limitations of conventional mouse 
models of RA-like disease and provides a closer look into studies in humanized 
mice exploring their usefulness and necessity as preclinical models for testing 
of cell-based therapies in autoimmune diseases such as RA.

Osteoclasts have a unique bone-destroying capacity, playing key roles in 
steady-state bone remodeling and arthritic bone erosion. Whether the osteoclasts 
in these different tissue settings arise from the same precursor states of 
monocytoid cells is presently unknown. Here, we show that osteoclasts in pannus 
originate exclusively from circulating bone marrow-derived cells and not from 
locally resident macrophages. We identify murine CX3CR1hiLy6CintF4/80+I-A+/I-E+ 
macrophages (termed here arthritis-associated osteoclastogenic macrophages 
(AtoMs)) as the osteoclast precursor-containing population in the inflamed 
synovium, comprising a subset distinct from conventional osteoclast precursors 
in homeostatic bone remodeling. Tamoxifen-inducible Foxm1 deletion suppressed 
the capacity of AtoMs to differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. 
Furthermore, synovial samples from human patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
contained CX3CR1+HLA-DRhiCD11c+CD80-CD86+ cells that corresponded to mouse 
AtoMs, and human osteoclastogenesis was inhibited by the FoxM1 inhibitor 
thiostrepton, constituting a potential target for rheumatoid arthritis 
treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a representative autoimmune disease characterized 
by chronic inflammation and joint destruction. Although biological inhibitors 
such as TNF-α and IL-6 antibodies have achieved success in clinical therapy, 
small molecule inhibitors against the Janus kinases (JAKs) involved in the 
signaling pathways of various cytokine receptors have gained more attraction as 
safe and efficacious options. In this study, we identified CS12192 as a novel 
selective JAK3/JAK1/TBK1 inhibitor and investigated its pharmacological effects 
on the experimental arthritis models in rat and mouse. We found that CS12192 
showed a more selective inhibitory activity on JAK3, and to a less extent on 
JAK1 and TBK1, that were verified by decreased activation of p-STATs and p-IRF3 
as well as down-regulation of IFN gene expression in the cultured cells with 
relevant stimuli. Furthermore, oral treatment with CS12192 dose-dependently 
ameliorated the disease severity, hind paw swelling, body weight loss, and bone 
destruction in rat models of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In a mouse CIA model, CS12192 also attenuated 
the disease severity, which was correlated with the suppressed CD4+ T cell 
activation and Th17 function, as well as the reduced cytokine levels in sera and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression in joint tissue. 
Corroboratively, RANKL-induced osteoclast formation was inhibited by CS12192. 
Thus, these results suggest that CS12192 as a novel selective JAK inhibitor has 
therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA and may provide a new strategy for 
the control of autoimmune diseases.

7. Monoclonal Antibodies.

LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
[Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Diseases; 2012–.
2019 Apr 12.

Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity 
(mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are 
typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human 
plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen 
cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant 
self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the 
hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These 
initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in 
laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as 
therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. 
Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means 
of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal 
antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal 
antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized 
(-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and 
experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in 
clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific 
immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the 
pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, 
monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), 
which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically 
mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In 
addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or 
inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or 
signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat 
severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to 
therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic 
dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or 
bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall 
into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. 
Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large 
proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often 
intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, 
but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis 
and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The 
hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are 
broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can 
used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate 
toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce 
drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other 
hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously 
administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and 
generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal 
antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an 
immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the 
immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including 
tuberculosis and hepatitis B.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models in mice induced by immunization enable the 
analyses of molecular mechanism involved in disease development, progression, 
and resolution of inflammation. Here, we describe three different models 
mimicking clinic symptoms of human rheumatoid arthritis, which could be 
transferable to any genetically modified mouse. We will present the protocol for 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), K/BxN serum-induced arthritis (SIA), and the 
antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) models. To do so, we will detail their way of 
induction but also how to analyze RA clinical score and pathology 
characterization. Finally, we will briefly discuss the main characteristics and 
disadvantages of all three models.

The targeted delivery of therapeutics to sites of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has 
been a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the intrinsic inflammation-targeting 
capacity of macrophages, a macrophage-derived microvesicle (MMV)-coated 
nanoparticle (MNP) was developed for targeting RA. The MMV was efficiently 
produced through a novel method. Cytochalasin B (CB) was applied to relax the 
interaction between the cytoskeleton and membrane of macrophages, thus 
stimulating MMV secretion. The proteomic profile of the MMV was analyzed by 
iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). The MMV membrane 
proteins were similar to those of macrophages, indicating that the MMV could 
exhibit bioactivity similar to that of RA-targeting macrophages. A poly(lactic- 
co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle was subsequently coated with MMV, and the 
inflammation-mediated targeting capacity of the MNP was evaluated both in vitro 
and in vivo. The in vitro binding of MNP to inflamed HUVECs was significantly 
stronger than that of the red blood cell membrane-coated nanoparticle (RNP). 
Compared with bare NP and RNP, MNP showed a significantly enhanced targeting 
effect in vivo in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. The targeting 
mechanism was subsequently revealed according to the proteomic analysis, 
indicating that Mac-1 and CD44 contributed to the outstanding targeting effect 
of the MNP. A model drug, tacrolimus, was encapsulated in MNP (T-RNP) and 
significantly suppressed the progression of RA in mice. The present study 
demonstrates MMV as a promising and rich material, with which to mimic 
macrophages, and demonstrates that MNP is an efficient biomimetic vehicle for RA 
targeting and treatment.

Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) have an important role in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) owing to their ability to generate citrullinated 
proteins - the hallmark autoantigens of RA. Of the five PAD enzyme isoforms, 
PAD2 and PAD4 are the most strongly implicated in RA at both genetic and 
cellular levels, and PAD inhibitors have shown therapeutic efficacy in mouse 
models of inflammatory arthritis. PAD2 and PAD4 are additionally targeted by 
autoantibodies in distinct clinical subsets of patients with RA, suggesting 
anti-PAD antibodies as possible biomarkers for RA diagnosis and prognosis. This 
Review weighs the evidence that supports a pathogenic role for PAD enzymes in RA 
as both promoters and targets of the autoimmune response, as well as discussing 
the mechanistic and therapeutic implications of these findings in the wider 
context of RA pathogenesis. Understanding the origin and consequences of 
dysregulated PAD enzyme activity and immune responses against PAD enzymes will 
be important to fully comprehend the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this 
disease and for the development of novel strategies to treat and prevent RA.

Curcumin is a natural herbal product that has been popularly used to treat 
autoimmune diseases in China; however, its effects on rheumatoid arthritis and 
its mechanism are not clear. The main purposes of this study are to explore the 
therapeutic effects of curcumin on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and the 
pharmacological mechanism. In the present study, CIA rats were established by 
injecting bovine type II collagen. Curcumin and methotrexate were then orally 
administered daily, and the swelling degree of the hind limb joints was scored 
every two days. Histopathological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin 
staining. The levels of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17 and TGF-β) were detected 
by radioimmunoassay, while the expression of IκBα and COX-2 was detected by 
Western blot. In addition, cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay, and the 
effect of curcumin on macrophage apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and 
TUNEL assay. The results indicated that in vivo curcumin attenuated the degree 
of joint swelling of rats and the further development of joint histopathology. 
Moreover, it downregulated the levels of cytokines. In vitro curcumin inhibited 
the degradation of IκBα and reduced the production of COX-2 in LPS-induced 
inflammatory RAW264.7 cells. Importantly, curcumin significantly induced 
macrophage apoptosis. In conclusion, in this study, we have demonstrated that 
curcumin exerts therapeutic effects on arthritis in CIA rats and has a strong 
pharmacological activity on reducing the inflammatory response in macrophages. 
Its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway 
and the promotion of macrophage apoptosis.

The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic 
processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive 
oxygen species1. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also 
known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family2 and links 
succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and 
inflammation3-5. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger 
signal6-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver 
fibrosis7, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis3,8-it is of interest as a 
therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat 
SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive 
conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in 
conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for 
species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the 
high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a 
high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that 
these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and 
its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will 
further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.

A role for B cells in autoimmune diseases is now clearly established both in 
mouse models and humans by successful treatment of multiple sclerosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies that eliminate B 
cells. However, the underlying mechanisms by which B cells promote the 
development of autoimmune diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we review 
evidence that patients with autoimmune disease suffer from defects in early 
B-cell tolerance checkpoints and therefore fail to counterselect developing 
autoreactive B cells. These B-cell tolerance defects are primary to autoimmune 
diseases and may result from altered B-cell receptor signaling and dysregulated 
T-cell/regulatory T-cell compartment. As a consequence, large numbers of 
autoreactive naive B cells accumulate in the blood of patients with autoimmune 
diseases and may promote autoimmunity through the presentation of self-antigen 
to T cells. In addition, new evidence suggests that this reservoir of

Because of its role in mediating both B cell and Fc receptor signaling, Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a promising target for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). Evobrutinib is a novel, highly selective, irreversible BTK inhibitor that 
potently inhibits BCR- and Fc receptor-mediated signaling and, thus, subsequent 
activation and function of human B cells and innate immune cells such as 
monocytes and basophils. We evaluated evobrutinib in preclinical models of RA 
and SLE and characterized the relationship between BTK occupancy and inhibition 
of disease activity. In mouse models of RA and SLE, orally administered 
evobrutinib displayed robust efficacy, as demonstrated by reduction of disease 
severity and histological damage. In the SLE model, evobrutinib inhibited B cell 
activation, reduced autoantibody production and plasma cell numbers, and 
normalized B and T cell subsets. In the RA model, efficacy was achieved despite 
failure to reduce autoantibodies. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling 
showed that mean BTK occupancy in blood cells of 80% was linked to near-complete 
disease inhibition in both RA and SLE mouse models. In addition, evobrutinib 
inhibited mast cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Thus, 
evobrutinib achieves efficacy by acting both on B cells and innate immune cells. 
Taken together, our data show that evobrutinib is a promising molecule for the 
chronic treatment of B cell-driven autoimmune disorders.

OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease lacking 
highly effective treatment options. Here we tested if targeting both BAFF and 
ICOSL has superior efficacy than single target inhibition in the mouse arthritis 
and lupus models. We also generated AMG 570, an ICOSL and BAFF bispecific 
inhibitory molecule, for potential treatment of autoimmune diseases such as SLE.
METHODS: Murine BAFF/ICOSL bispecific, combination of BAFF and ICOSL inhibitors 
or single inhibitor was evaluated in the sheep red blood cell (SRBC) challenge 
model, mouse collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model, or NZB/NZW lupus models. 
AMG 570 was tested for human and cyno BAFF and ICOSL binding affinities by 
Kinexa A. AMG 570 dual target blocking activities was evaluated in human and 
cyno BAFF and ICOSL mediated B cell and T cell assay, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamics effect of AMG 570 was evaluated in cynomolgus monkey.
RESULTS: Treatment with murine ICOSL/BAFF bispecific or combination therapy was 
more efficacious than single ICOSL or BAFF inhibitor in mouse NZB/NZW lupus 
model. Dual ICOSL and BAFF inhibition was also more effective in the mouse 
collagen induced arthritis (CIA) model. AMG 570 was developed as the clinical 
bispecific lead. AMG 570 inhibits human and cynomolgus monkey ICOSL and BAFF. B 
cell reduction was observed after AMG 570 treatment in cynomolgus monkeys, 
consistent with the pharmacological effect of BAFF inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: By targeting both ICOSL and BAFF, AMG 570 has the potential to 
achieve superior efficacy in treatment of autoimmune diseases such as SLE and 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Regulatory T (Treg ) cells represent an essential component of peripheral 
tolerance. Given their potently immunosuppressive functions that is orchestrated 
by the lineage-defining transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3), 
clinical modulation of these cells in autoimmunity and cancer is a promising 
therapeutic target. However, recent evidence in mice and humans indicates that 
Treg cells represent a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneic population. 
Indeed, both suppressive and non-suppressive Treg cells exist in human blood 
that are otherwise indistinguishable from one another using classical Treg cell 
markers such as CD25 and FoxP3. Moreover, murine Treg cells display a degree of 
plasticity through which they acquire the trafficking pathways needed to home to 
tissues containing target effector T (Teff ) cells. However, this plasticity can 
also result in Treg cell lineage instability and acquisition of proinflammatory 
Teff cell functions. Consequently, these dysfunctional CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells in 
human and mouse may fail to maintain peripheral tolerance and instead support 
immunopathology. The mechanisms driving human Treg cell dysfunction are largely 
undefined, and obscured by the scarcity of reliable immunophenotypical markers 
and the disregard paid to Treg cell antigen-specificity in functional assays. 
Here, we review the mechanisms controlling the stability of the FoxP3+ Treg cell 
lineage phenotype. Particular attention will be paid to the developmental and 
functional heterogeneity of human Treg cells, and how abrogating these 
mechanisms can lead to lineage instability and Treg cell dysfunction in diseases 
like immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) 
syndrome, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

Vagus nerve stimulation can ameliorate autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis by modulation of the immune system. Its efficacy for the treatment of 
type 1 diabetes has not been explored, in part because the nerves projecting to 
the pancreatic lymph nodes (pLNs) in mice are unmapped. Here, we map the nerve 
projecting to the pancreas and pLNs in mice and use a minimally invasive 
surgical procedure to implant micro-cuff electrodes onto the nerve. Pancreatic 
nerve electrical stimulation (PNES) resulted in β-adrenergic 
receptor-mediated-accumulation of B and T cells in pLNs and reduced production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. 
Autoreactive T cells showed reduced proliferation in pLNs of mice receiving PNES 
as compared to sham controls. In a spontaneous mouse model of autoimmune 
diabetes, PNES inhibited disease progression in diabetic mice.

Rho family proteins are prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase type I 
(GGTase-I), which normally target proteins to membranes for GTP-loading. 
However, conditional deletion of GGTase-I in mouse macrophages increases 
GTP-loading of Rho proteins, leading to enhanced inflammatory responses and 
severe rheumatoid arthritis. Here we show that heterozygous deletion of the Rho 
family gene Rac1, but not Rhoa and Cdc42, reverses inflammation and arthritis in 
GGTase-I-deficient mice. Non-prenylated Rac1 has a high affinity for the adaptor 
protein Ras GTPase-activating-like protein 1 (Iqgap1), which facilitates both 
GTP exchange and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of Rac1. Consistently, 
inactivating Iqgap1 normalizes Rac1 GTP-loading, and reduces inflammation and 
arthritis in GGTase-I-deficient mice, as well as prevents statins from 
increasing Rac1 GTP-loading and cytokine production in macrophages. We conclude 
that blocking prenylation stimulates Rac1 effector interactions and unleashes 
proinflammatory signaling. Our results thus suggest that prenylation normally 
restrains innate immune responses by preventing Rac1 effector interactions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease. We examined the effect of gut microbiota in a mouse 
model of RA that develops atherosclerosis.
METHODS: We created three groups of K/BxN female mice that were positive for the 
anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) antibody: control diet (CD), high fat 
diet (HFD), and HFD with hydroxychloroquine (HFD + HCQ). Serological tests were 
used to detect the serum levels of total cholesterol (TCHO), low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), anti-GPI antibody titers, and serum cytokines. 
Atherosclerotic plaque was determined by histological analysis, and gut 
microbiota were determined by 16sV4 sequencing.
RESULTS: Relative to mice given the CD, those receiving the HFD had increased 
serum levels of LDL-C, TCHO, and TG, decreased serum levels of HDL-C, increased 
atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root, and altered gut microbiota. Addition 
of HCQ to HFD decreased the serum levels of LDL-C, TCHO, and TG, increased serum 
levels of HDL-C, and decreased the atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root. 
Mice receiving HFD + HCQ also had the greatest bacterial diversity among the 
three experimental groups. Moreover, HCQ treatment significantly increased the 
abundance of Akkermansia and Parabacteroides, and decreased the abundance of 
Clostridium sensu stricto cluster 1, and therefore may be responsible for the 
reduced RA-associated atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia.
CONCLUSION: Our mouse model of RA indicated that HFD increased ankle width and 
aggravated atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia, and that HCQ alleviated the 
dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, but had no effect on ankle width.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the pathophysiology of cardiovascular (CV) dysfunction 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is crucial, but limited by the paucity of animal 
models able to mimic CV impairments. We wanted to determine if the rat model of 
Pristane-Induced Arthritis (PIA) reproduced cardiometabolic impairments of RA.
METHODS: Dark Agouti rats received an injection of pristane or saline (controls) 
at day 0. Reactivity to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators was studied in aortic 
rings and mesenteric arteries at day 28 (acute) and day 120 post-induction 
(chronic phase). Circulating markers of inflammation, lipid and glucose levels, 
arthritis and radiographic scores were assessed.
RESULTS: In aortic rings, PIA induced a reduced vasoconstriction to 
phenylephrine and serotonin in both phases of the model. The relaxant effect of 
acetylcholine was decreased in PIA in acute (P < 0.05) but not in chronic phase. 
In mesenteric arteries, only the acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was 
impaired in PIA rats in the chronic phase (P < 0.001). Serum interleukin-6 
levels were higher, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were lower in PIA 
in both phases (P < 0.001) whereas myeloperoxidase activity and blood glucose 
were unchanged. Adiponectine levels were lower in PIA in acute (P < 0.001) but 
not in chronic phase. Endothelial function correlated with interleukin-6, total 
cholesterol levels and arthritis score in aorta but not in mesenteric arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: As new information, PIA induces endothelial dysfunction in 
micro-/macro-vascular beds and low lipid levels, like in RA. This model of 
chronic arthritis might be useful to study CV pathophysiology and to screen new 
therapeutic options for reducing CV risk in RA.

AIM: Anemia of chronic disease is considered the most common extra-articular 
manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study aimed to 
investigate the effect of etanercept (anti-tumor necrosis factor) on anemia and 
hepcidin gene expression in a rat model of RA.
METHOD: Rheumatoid arthritis was induced in rats by Freund Complete Adjuvant 
(FCA; 1 mg/0.1 ml paraffin oil, subcutaneously) on days (0, 30 and 40). 
Etanercept was administered subcutaneously at a dose of (0.3 mg/kg 3 
times/week). Arthritis parameters, erythrocytic indices, iron profile, serum 
TNF-α, serum IL-6 and hepatic RT-PCR hepcidin expression were assessed.
RESULTS: FCA-rats developed arthritis and anemia, with significant increase of 
serum TNFα and IL-6 levels, and of hepcidin gene expression. In RA-rats, 
etanercept administration improved arthritis, corrected the erythrocyte indices 
and restored serum iron and ferritin with significant reduction in TNF-α, IL-6 
and hepcidin gene expression. Hepcidin expression was negatively correlated to 
erythrocytic indices and iron profile, while it was positively correlated to 
serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels.
CONCLUSION: Etanercept improved anemia in this animal model of RA, which could 
be explained in part by the reduction in hepcidin gene expression.

The hormone melatonin has many properties, including antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Melatonin has been demonstrated 
to be beneficial in several inflammatory autoimmune diseases, but its effects in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain controversial. We sought to determine how 
melatonin regulates inflammation in RA. We found that melatonin dose-dependently 
inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1β expression 
through the PI3K/AKT, ERK, and NF-κB signaling pathways. We also identified that 
melatonin inhibits TNF-α and IL-1β production by upregulating miR-3150a-3p 
expression. Synovial tissue specimens from RA patients and culture of human 
rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes confirmed that the MT1 receptor is 
needed for the anti-inflammatory activities of melatonin. Importantly, melatonin 
also significantly reduced paw swelling, cartilage degradation, and bone erosion 
in the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Our results indicate that 
melatonin ameliorates RA by inhibiting TNF-α and IL-1β production through 
downregulation of the PI3K/AKT, ERK, NF-κB signaling pathways, as well as 
miR-3150a-3p overexpression. The role of melatonin as an adjuvant treatment in 
patients with RA deserves further clinical studies.

Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai, China.

Platelets play important roles in blood clotting, hemostasis and wound repair, 
while more and more research show that platelets also have significant 
contributions in the process of inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic 
systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. Platelet microparticles, which are 
membrane vesicles shed by activated platelets, are reported to amplify 
inflammation in Rheumatoid arthritis. Here we show that either platelet-specific 
deletion of Rac1 (Rac1-/-) or Rac1-specific inhibitor NSC23766 dramatically 
inhibit platelet-derived microparticles formation. As we all know, 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model is the most common autoimmune model 
of rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, NSC23766 alleviated the process of 
collagen-induced arthritis of DBA mice in vivo, including the reduced hind paw 
thickness and ankle stiffness, the reduction of arthritic scores and incidence 
of arthritis. Our work also found that NSC23766-treated CIA mouse spleen is less 
swollen and contains less enlarged white pulp than PBS control. The histological 
analysis shows that NSC23766-treated but not solvent control improve the 
cartilage erosion symptom in the joint of CIA mouse. Interestingly, platelet 
microparticles in the peripheral blood of NSC23766-treated CIA mice were 
decreased significantly compared with PBS-treated CIA mice. In conclusion, our 
work demonstrated that Rac1 inhibition alleviates collagen-induced arthritis 
through the decrease of platelet microparticles' release. In short, Rac1 
aggravate the rheumatoid arthritis deterioration through the regulation of 
platelet microparticles formation.

Due to atrophy, muscle weakness is a common occurrence in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). The majority of human studies are conducted on the vastus lateralis 
muscle-a muscle with mixed fiber type-but little comparative data between 
multiple muscles in either rodent or human models are available. The current 
study therefore assessed both muscle ultrastructure and selected redox 
indicators across various muscles in a model of collagen-induced rheumatoid 
arthritis in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Only three muscles, the gastrocnemius, 
extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus, had lower muscle mass (38%, 27%, 
and 25% loss of muscle mass, respectively; all at least P < 0.01), while the 
vastus lateralis muscle mass was increased by 35% (P < 0.01) in RA animals when 
compared to non-RA controls. However, all four muscles exhibited signs of 
deterioration indicative of rheumatoid cachexia. Cross-sectional area was 
similarly reduced in gastrocnemius, EDL, and soleus (60%, 58%, and 64%, 
respectively; all P < 0.001), but vastus lateralis (22% smaller, P < 0.05) was 
less affected, while collagen deposition was significantly increased in muscles. 
This pathology was associated with significant increases in tissue levels of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all muscles except the vastus lateralis, while 
only the gastrocnemius had significantly increased levels of lipid peroxidation 
(TBARS) and antioxidant activity (FRAP). Current data illustrates the 
differential responses of different skeletal muscles of the hindlimb to a 
chronic inflammatory challenge both in terms of redox changes and resistance to 
cachexia.

The present study was designed to explore the biological role of resveratrol 
(RES) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the underlying mechanism. The 
adjuvant-induced arthritic rats were administered RES on the 12th day after 
model establishment, and then arthritis assessment, oxidative stress 
measurement, histological examination, and immunohistochemical staining were 
performed. The primary rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated and 
treated with RES in vitro and then cell proliferation and apoptosis assay were 
examined. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, luciferase reporter assay, 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination, western blot, and 
quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to 
investigate the mechanisms. RES administration decreased arthritis scores and 
serum levels of antioxidant enzymes, attenuated paw swelling, synovial 
hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage degradation, as well 
as inhibited synoviocyte proliferation in synovial tissues. Further 
investigation indicated that RES inhibited ROS production and FLS proliferation 
through activating the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. NF-κB was confirmed to 
negatively regulate miR-29a-3p and miR-23a-3p expression by directly binding to 
its promoter. Mechanistic analyses further revealed that Kelch-like erythroid 
cell-derived protein with CNC homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap1), a 
negative regulator of Nrf2, was a downstream target of miR-29a-3p, while 
miR-23a-3p directly targeted cullin3 (cul3), a master regulator of 
ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. Together, the present study provided 
evidence that RES ameliorated RA through activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling 
pathway via SIRT1/NF-κB/miR-29a-3p/Keap1 and SIRT1/NF-κB/miR-23a-3p/cul3 
signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Genomic medicine has paved the way for identifying biomarkers and 
therapeutically actionable targets for complex diseases, but is complicated by 
the involvement of thousands of variably expressed genes across multiple cell 
types. Single-cell RNA-sequencing study (scRNA-seq) allows the characterization 
of such complex changes in whole organs.
METHODS: The study is based on applying network tools to organize and analyze 
scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis and human rheumatoid arthritis, 
in order to find diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Diagnostic 
validation studies were performed using expression profiling data and potential 
protein biomarkers from prospective clinical studies of 13 diseases. A candidate 
drug was examined by a treatment study of a mouse model of arthritis, using 
phenotypic, immunohistochemical, and cellular analyses as read-outs.
RESULTS: We performed the first systematic analysis of pathways, potential 
biomarkers, and drug targets in scRNA-seq data from a complex disease, starting 
with inflamed joints and lymph nodes from a mouse model of arthritis. We found 
the involvement of hundreds of pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets that 
differed greatly between cell types. Analyses of scRNA-seq and GWAS data from 
human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) supported a similar dispersion of pathogenic 
mechanisms in different cell types. Thus, systems-level approaches to prioritize 
biomarkers and drugs are needed. Here, we present a prioritization strategy that 
is based on constructing network models of disease-associated cell types and 
interactions using scRNA-seq data from our mouse model of arthritis, as well as 
human RA, which we term multicellular disease models (MCDMs). We find that the 
network centrality of MCDM cell types correlates with the enrichment of genes 
harboring genetic variants associated with RA and thus could potentially be used 
to prioritize cell types and genes for diagnostics and therapeutics. We 
validated this hypothesis in a large-scale study of patients with 13 different 
autoimmune, allergic, infectious, malignant, endocrine, metabolic, and 
cardiovascular diseases, as well as a therapeutic study of the mouse arthritis 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support that our strategy has the potential to 
help prioritize diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by joint 
synovial inflammation and is a challenge for researchers and clinicians. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) represent a group of small non-coding RNA molecules that 
post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA expression and are involved in various 
diseases, including cancer, autoimmune and metabolic diseases, as well as 
neurological disorders. In the present study, various experiments were performed 
to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of miR-155 in RA using rat 
synoviocytes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to model rheumatoid arthritis. 
It was revealed that synovial fibroblasts exhibited significantly higher miR-155 
mRNA levels than the control group. Compared with the RA group, the viability of 
synovial fibroblasts was significantly decreased in the miR-155 mimics + RA 
group, but markedly increased in the miR-155 inhibitor + RA group. Compared with 
that in the RA + NC mimic or RA + NC inhibitor groups, the apoptosis of synovial 
fibroblasts increased significantly in the miR-155 mimics + RA group, but was 
significantly decreased in the miR-155 inhibitor + RA group. The miR-155 mimics 
+ RA group exhibited higher expression levels of β-catenin, matrix 
metalloproteinase 7 and cyclin D1 compared with the miR-155 inhibitor + RA 
group, and the glycogen synthase kinase protein levels was lower compared with 
the miR-155 inhibitor + RA group. In brief, it was inferred that the Wnt 
signaling pathway is involved in the miR-155-associated inhibition of RA 
synovial fibroblast viability and induction of cell apoptosis. Inhibition of 
miR-155 may be an effective treatment for RA through regulation of the Wnt 
signaling pathway to reduce cell apoptosis and enhance cell viability.

Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurodegeneration. 
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor however, mechanisms 
independent of IOP play a role in RGC pathology. Both antibodies and CD4 T-cells 
as well as microbiota take part in the pathogenesis of both glaucoma and 
rheumatoid arteritis (RA).Heat shock proteins (HSPs) which originate in bacteria 
cross-react with RCG epitopes and were involved in rat model of retinal injury. 
Enhanced expression of HSPs in the retina was associated with glaucoma-like 
neuropathology and previous studies have also suggested a pathogenic role for 
HSPs in RA. In view of these data we suggest that glaucoma should be included in 
the spectrum of autoimmune diseases and that proven medications for RA should be 
adopted as an innovative IOP -independent therapeutic strategy for glaucoma.

Exercise therapy inhibits joint destruction by suppressing pro-inflammatory 
cytokines. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for rheumatoid arthritis differs 
depending on the phase of the disease, but that of exercise therapy for each 
phase is unknown. We assessed the differences in the efficacy of treadmill 
running on rheumatoid arthritis at various phases, using rat rheumatoid 
arthritis models. Rats with collagen-induced arthritis were used as rheumatoid 
arthritis models, and the phase after immunization was divided as pre-arthritis 
and established phases. Histologically, the groups with forced treadmill running 
in the established phase had significantly inhibited joint destruction compared 
with the other groups. The group with forced treadmill running in only the 
established phase had significantly better bone morphometry and reduced 
expression of connexin 43 and tumor necrosis factor α in the synovial membranes 
compared with the no treadmill group. Furthermore, few cells were positive for 
cathepsin K immunostaining in the groups with forced treadmill running in the 
established phase. Our results suggest that the efficacy of exercise therapy may 
differ depending on rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Active exercise 
during phases of decreased disease activity may effectively inhibit arthritis 
and joint destruction.

OBJECTIVES: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase 
required for intracellular signaling downstream of multiple immunoreceptors. We 
evaluated ABBV-105, a covalent BTK inhibitor, using in vitro and in vivo assays 
to determine potency, selectivity, and efficacy to validate the therapeutic 
potential of ABBV-105 in inflammatory disease.
METHODS: ABBV-105 potency and selectivity were evaluated in enzymatic and 
cellular assays. The impact of ABBV-105 on B cell function in vivo was assessed 
using mechanistic models of antibody production. Efficacy of ABBV-105 in chronic 
inflammatory disease was evaluated in animal models of arthritis and lupus. 
Measurement of BTK occupancy was employed as a target engagement biomarker.
RESULTS: ABBV-105 irreversibly inhibits BTK, demonstrating superior kinome 
selectivity and is potent in B cell receptor, Fc receptor, and TLR-9-dependent 
cellular assays. Oral administration resulted in rapid clearance in plasma, but 
maintenance of BTK splenic occupancy. ABBV-105 inhibited antibody responses to 
thymus-independent and thymus-dependent antigens, paw swelling and bone 
destruction in rat collagen induced arthritis, and reduced disease in an 
IFNα-accelerated lupus nephritis model. BTK occupancy in disease models 
correlated with in vivo efficacy.
CONCLUSION: ABBV-105, a selective BTK inhibitor, demonstrates compelling 
efficacy in pre-clinical mechanistic models of antibody production and in models 
of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder demanding the 
development of novel therapeutic strategy. Butyrate is a functional short-chain 
fatty acid produced by the anaerobic intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to 
investigate the attenuation of butyrate on RA. The collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) mouse model was established and butyrate was administered in drinking 
water along with the collagen immunization. The histopathological features, 
clinical score, paw swelling, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-17A were measured to 
determine the amelioration of butyrate on arthritis. The differentiation of Treg 
cells and Th17 cells in the splenic cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The 
expression of Foxp3, IL-10, Rorγt and IL-17A were detected by RT-PCR and FACS 
immunostaining. Anti-IL10R antibody was used in the CIA and CD4+ cell cultures 
to mediate the effects of butyrate. Butyrate significantly inhibited expressions 
of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17A, but promoted the expression of IL-10. Butyrate also 
increased systematical Treg cells and reduced Th17 cells. Mechanism study 
revealed that butyrate directly enhanced the polarization of Treg cells but not 
Th17 cells. All effects of butyrate on RA were inversed by the co-administered 
anti-IL10R antibody. This study showed that butyrate administration inhibited 
arthritis in CIA mice model, suppressed the expression of inflammatory 
cytokines. The modulation may be mediated the differentiation of CD4 T cells 
towards Treg cells, which produce anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and thus 
influenced the function of Th17 cells.

Targeted noninvasive control of the nervous system and end-organs may enable 
safer and more effective treatment of multiple diseases compared to invasive 
devices or systemic medications. One target is the cholinergic anti-inflammatory 
pathway that consists of the vagus nerve to spleen circuit, which has been 
stimulated with implantable devices to improve autoimmune conditions such as 
rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report that daily noninvasive ultrasound (US) 
stimulation targeting the spleen significantly reduces disease severity in a 
mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Improvements are observed only with 
specific parameters, in which US can provide both protective and therapeutic 
effects. Single cell RNA sequencing of splenocytes and experiments in 
genetically-immunodeficient mice reveal the importance of both T and B cell 
populations in the anti-inflammatory pathway. These findings demonstrate the 
potential for US stimulation of the spleen to treat inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: Early treatment is key for optimizing the therapeutic success of 
drugs, and the current initiating treatment that blocks the progression of bone 
destruction during the pre-arthritic stages remains unsatisfactory. The 
microbial disorder in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is significantly 
reversed with effective treatment. Modulating aberrant gut microbiomes into a 
healthy state is a potential therapeutic approach for preventing bone damage.
RESULTS: By using metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide 
association study, we assessed the effect of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) on 
the induction of arthritis as well as on the associated gut microbiota and 
immune disorders in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. Treatment of AIA rats 
with L. casei inhibited joint swelling, lowered arthritis scores, and prevented 
bone destruction. Along with the relief of arthritis symptoms, dysbiosis in the 
microbiome of arthritic rats was significantly reduced after L. casei 
intervention. The relative abundance of AIA-decreased Lactobacillus strains, 
including Lactobacillus hominis, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus 
vaginalis, were restored to normal and Lactobacillus acidophilus was upregulated 
by the administration of L. casei to the AIA rats. Moreover, L. casei 
downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are closely 
linked to the effect of the L. casei treatment-associated microbes. 
Functionally, the maintenance of the redox balance of oxidative stress was 
involved in the improvement in the L. casei-treated AIA rats.
CONCLUSION: A single bacterium, L. casei (ATCC334), was able to significantly 
suppress the induction of AIA and protect bones from destruction in AIA rats by 
restoring the microbiome dysbiosis in the gut, indicating that using probiotics 
may be a promising strategy for treating RA, especially in the early stage of 
the disease.

Genetic variants at the PTPN2 locus, which encodes the tyrosine phosphatase 
PTPN2, cause reduced gene expression and are linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and other autoimmune diseases. PTPN2 inhibits signaling through the T cell and 
cytokine receptors, and loss of PTPN2 promotes T cell expansion and CD4- and 
CD8-driven autoimmunity. However, it remains unknown whether loss of PTPN2 in 
FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) plays a role in autoimmunity. Here we aimed to 
model human autoimmune-predisposing PTPN2 variants, the presence of which 
results in a partial loss of PTPN2 expression, in mouse models of RA. We 
identified that reduced expression of Ptpn2 enhanced the severity of autoimmune 
arthritis in the T cell-dependent SKG mouse model and demonstrated that this 
phenotype was mediated through a Treg-intrinsic mechanism. Mechanistically, we 
found that through dephosphorylation of STAT3, PTPN2 inhibits IL-6-driven 
pathogenic loss of FoxP3 after Tregs have acquired RORγt expression, at a stage 
when chromatin accessibility for STAT3-targeted IL-17-associated transcription 
factors is maximized. We conclude that PTPN2 promotes FoxP3 stability in mouse 
RORγt+ Tregs and that loss of function of PTPN2 in Tregs contributes to the 
association between PTPN2 and autoimmunity.

BACKGROUND: Genkwanin is a flavone isolated from the traditional Chinese herb 
Daphne genkwa. Our previous work proved that four flavonoids (including 
genkwanin) isolated from D. genkwa (FFD) significantly improved the symptoms of 
arthritis in rat models. Recent studies have revealed that genkwanin exhibited 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, both of which were closely 
related to the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, studying the 
anti-RA effects and mechanisms of genkwanin may give us insight into FFD's 
therapeutic effects on RA.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis activity 
of genkwanin on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in rats and explore the 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: The anti-rheumatoid arthritis activity of genkwanin was evaluated on 
AIA rat model by determining the paw swelling degrees and arthritis index 
scores, along with histopathological analysis of joint tissues. The serum 
cytokine levels were measured by ELISA method, and serum NO levels were measured 
by Griess method. The expression and phosphorylation levels of proteins in 
JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways were determined by western blot analysis 
and immunohistochemistry analysis.
RESULTS: Genkwanin significantly decreased the paw swelling and arthritis index 
in AIA rats and also decreased the inflammation and bone destruction in joint 
tissues. The serum TNF-α, IL-6, and NO concentrations were markedly reduced 
while the IL-10 concentration was markedly increased with the treatment of 
genkwanin. Genkwanin inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling 
pathways in synovial tissues of AIA rats.
CONCLUSION: Genkwanin exerted anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects on AIA rats 
through inhibiting the activation of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. The 
results obtained in this work lead us to suggest that Genkwanin could play 
a crucial role on the previously demonstrated anti-rheumatoid arthritis activity 
of flavonoid extract of D. genkwa (namely FFD).

Background/Introduction: Aberrant expression of Toll like receptors (TLR) plays 
a vital role in pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Micro RNAs (miRs) 
could play important role in the related signaling pathways. The present study 
was undertaken to establish the link between miR-147 and TLR-7 in rat 
macrophages (in vitro) and in pristane (PS) induced arthritic rats.
METHODOLOGY: Dual luciferase assay was done to confirm the interaction between 
miR-147 and TLR-7. The effect of miR-147 on regulation of TLR-7 was done by 
RT-qPCR and Immunoblotting studies in rat macrophages (ATCC® CRL-2192TM) after 
treating them with miR-147 mimics and inhibitors. R-848 (Imiquimod) was used as 
TLR-7 stimulant, the mRNA and protein expression levels of IFN-β and TNF-α were 
recorded to determine the regulation of TLR-7. The levels of miR-147 and TLR-7 
were evaluated during induction of rat bone marrow derived macrophage in the PS 
induced rat macrophages and spleens of methotrexate exposed rats. The miR-147 
mimics was injected intraperitoneal to the PS treated rats and the severity of 
arthritis was studied.
RESULTS: The study confirmed TLR-7 mRNA as the potential target of miR-147 in 
rats. Alterations in miR-147 by transfecting mimics or inhibitors in ATCC® 
CRL-2192TM cells exhibited suppression and amelioration of TLR-7 and cytokine 
expression. The alteration in expression of miR-147 was inversely correlated 
with expression of TLR-7 during bone marrow derived macrophages induction in PS 
exposed cells and spleens. The abnormal expression was reversed in spleens of 
methotrexate treated arthritic rats. The treatment of miR-147 mimic caused 
suppression in expression of TLR-7 and improved the severity of arthritis in PS 
induced arthritic rats.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-147 inversely regulates the TLR-7 signaling by targeting TLR-7 
itself both in vivo and in vitro. The study provides a novel approach for 
conditions involving abnormal TLR-7 expression in arthritis.

Leukocytes travel within the circulation and enter connective tissues by 
interactions with endothelium of postcapillary venules mediated by cell adhesion 
molecules, summarized as the leukocyte adhesion cascade. In the severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial 
fibroblasts (SF) migrated to distant cartilage through the vasculature. 
Therefore, RASF adhesion toward endothelial cells (EC) and E- and P-selectins 
were analyzed. Cell-to-cell binding assays between SF and EC were performed. 
Interactions of SF with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-activated EC or selectins 
were analyzed in flow adhesion assays. Immunohistochemistry for E-selectin 
ligand CD15s was performed. CD15s induction in RASF by human serum or media was 
evaluated. Wild-type and E-/-/ P-/- Selectin-SCID mice were used for 
inverse-wrap surgery. After laser-mediated microdissection, real-time PCR for 
E-/P-selectin/vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 was performed. Adhesion between 
SF/EC under static conditions was highest in Roswell Park Memorial 
Institute-cultured RASF to TNFαα-activated human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (2.25-fold) and RASF adhesion was higher toward venous than arterial EC 
(Dulbecco's modified eagle medium P = 0.0419, RPMI P = 0.0119). In flow chamber 
assays, RASF adhesion to E-selectin was higher than to P-selectin (e.g. 
0.9 dyn cm-2 P = 0.0001). Osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts showed lower 
rolling/adhesion properties (e.g. 0.5 dyn cm-2 , P = 0.0010). RASF adhesion to 
TNFαα-activated EC was increased (e.g. 0.9 dyn cm-2 , P = 0.0061). CD15s 
induction in RASF was strongest in RA serum. Vimentin/CD15s double-positive 
cells were detectable. In E-/P-selectin-deficient mice, contralateral invasion 
was reduced (P = 0.023). E- and P-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 
1 expression in EC of implants was confirmed. Our data indicate that the milieu 
within vessels induces CD15s which enables RASF to interact with E-selectin/EC 
under flow. Therefore, RASF may migrate to distant sites and leave the 
vasculature similarly to leukocytes.

Skin dryness is a characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model mice. 
However, the mechanism underlying the induction of dry skin by RA is unclear. We 
hypothesized that T helper (Th)2 and Th17 cells mediate this process. A mouse 
model of DBA/1JJmsSlc collagen-induced arthritis was treated with Th2 or Th17 
cell inhibitor, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and the expression of 
markers associated with allergic reaction and inflammation were evaluated. TEWL 
and plasma levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin (IL)-6 and -17, 
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were increased in the arthritis mouse model 
compared to that in control mice. Administration of Th2 cell inhibitor abolished 
the increase in TEWL, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, whereas Th17 cell inhibitor 
reversed TEWL and decreased IL-17 level. Th2 and Th17 cells contribute to the 
induction of dry skin, but via distinct mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: To examine and quantify the sexual dimorphism in pathologic features 
manifested in the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems and incidence of 
mortality in the tumor necrosis factor-transgenic (TNF-Tg; Tg3647 strain) mouse 
model of inflammatory erosive arthritis.
METHODS: Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were determined in male and female 
Tg3647 mice and sex-matched wild-type (WT) littermate mice. Longitudinal and 
cross-sectional pathologic outcomes in the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary 
systems were assessed via ultrasound, micro-computed tomography, grip strength 
measurements, histologic and serologic analyses, flow cytometry, and skeletal 
muscle physiologic measures.
RESULTS: Compared to male Tg3647 mice (n = 30), female Tg3647 mice (n = 34) had 
significantly shorter lifespans (P < 0.001) and exhibited the following 
pathologic features (n = 4-6 per group; P < 0.05 versus male Tg3647 
littermates): gross deficits in body mass and muscle weight, early-onset 
inflammatory arthritis with severity of end-stage arthritis that was as severe 
as that seen in male transgenic mice, and early onset and increased severity of 
inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD). Histologically, the ILD observed 
in Tg3647 mice was characterized by inflammatory cell accumulation and pulmonary 
arteriole thickening, which was concomitant with the presence of right 
ventricular hypertrophy, a feature that was also more severe in the female 
compared to male Tg3647 mice (P < 0.05). No sexual dimorphisms in TNF-induced 
deficient grip strength, axial skeletal growth, or bone loss were found. 
Globally, the extent of the pathologic changes observed in female Tg3647 mice 
was greater than that observed in male Tg3647 mice when each group was compared 
to their sex-matched WT littermates.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that TNF selectively drives the early onset 
of arthritis and progression of pathologic changes in the cardiopulmonary system 
in female Tg3647 mice. These results in the Tg3647 mouse identify it as a 
suitable model to better understand the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism 
and cardiopulmonary disease in the setting of inflammatory arthritis and other 
connective tissue diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Association between periodontal disease (PD) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) has been extensively described, but direct evidence of causal 
involvement of PD in RA is missing. We investigated the priming role of oral 
Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in PD and subsequent RA and we assessed 
biomarkers of bone resorption and arthritis development in rats.
METHODS: Lewis rats were orally exposed to either P. gingivalis, Prevotella 
intermedia or control gel for 1 month and then followed for 8 months. The onset 
and development of PD was assessed by serology, gingivitis severity and micro-CT 
(µCT). We investigated arthritis development using circulating proinflammatory 
markers, anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), anticitrullinated protein 
antibody (ACPA), ankle histology and µCT.
RESULTS: PD was only observed in the P. gingivalis treated rats, as early as 
1 month postexposure. Joint and systemic inflammation were detected only in the 
P. gingivalis group after 4 and 8 months. At 8 months, inflammatory cell 
infiltrate was observed in ankle joints and paralleled cortical erosions and 
overall cortical bone reduction. Furthermore, anti-CCP2 correlated with local 
and systemic bone loss.
CONCLUSIONS: In our long-term study, PD induced by oral exposure to P. 
gingivalis triggered seropositive arthritis, with systemic inflammation and bone 
erosions. This is the first in vivo demonstration of arthritis induced by oral 
priming with P. gingivalis.

Poor O2 supply to the infiltrated immune cells in the joint synovium of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) up-regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) 
expression and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, both of which 
exacerbate synovial inflammation. Synovial inflammation in RA can be resolved by 
eliminating pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and inducing anti-inflammatory M2 
macrophages. Because hypoxia and ROS in the RA synovium play a crucial role in 
the induction of M1 macrophages and reduction of M2 macrophages, herein, we 
develop manganese ferrite and ceria nanoparticle-anchored mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles (MFC-MSNs) that can synergistically scavenge ROS and produce O2 
for reducing M1 macrophage levels and inducing M2 macrophages for RA treatment. 
MFC-MSNs exhibit a synergistic effect on O2 generation and ROS scavenging that 
is attributed to the complementary reaction of ceria nanoparticles (NPs) that 
can scavenge intermediate hydroxyl radicals generated by manganese ferrite NPs 
in the process of O2 generation during the Fenton reaction, leading to the 
efficient polarization of M1 to M2 macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. 
Intra-articular administration of MFC-MSNs to rat RA models alleviated hypoxia, 
inflammation, and pathological features in the joint. Furthermore, MSNs were 
used as a drug-delivery vehicle, releasing the anti-rheumatic drug methotrexate 
in a sustained manner to augment the therapeutic effect of MFC-MSNs. This study 
highlights the therapeutic potential of MFC-MSNs that simultaneously generate O2 
and scavenge ROS, subsequently driving inflammatory macrophages to the 
anti-inflammatory subtype for RA treatment.

Recent studies indicate a causal relationship between the periodontal pathogen 
P. gingivalis and rheumatoid arthritis involving the production of 
autoantibodies against citrullinated peptides. We therefore postulated that 
therapeutic eradication P. gingivalis may ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis 
development and here turned to a mouse model in order to challenge our 
hypothesis. F1 (DBA/1 x B10.Q) mice were orally inoculated with P. gingivalis 
before collagen-induced arthritis was provoked. Chlorhexidine or metronidazole 
were orally administered either before or during the induction phase of 
arthritis and their effects on arthritis progression and alveolar bone loss were 
compared to intraperitoneally injected methotrexate. Arthritis incidence and 
severity were macroscopically scored and alveolar bone loss was evaluated via 
microcomputed tomography. Serum antibody titres against P. gingivalis were 
quantified by ELISA and microbial dysbiosis following oral inoculation was 
monitored in stool samples via microbiome analyses. Both, oral chlorhexidine and 
metronidazole reduced the incidence and ameliorated the severity of 
collagen-induced arthritis comparable to methotrexate. Likewise, all three 
therapies attenuated alveolar bone loss. Relative abundance of 
Porphyromonadaceae was increased after oral inoculation with P. gingivalis and 
decreased after treatment. This is the first study to describe beneficial 
effects of non-surgical periodontal treatment on collagen-induced arthritis in 
mice and suggests that mouthwash with chlorhexidine or metronidazole may also be 
beneficial for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a coexisting 
periodontitis. Methotrexate ameliorated periodontitis in mice, further raising 
the possibility that methotrexate may also positively impact on the tooth 
supporting tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: (-)-Epicatechin-3-O-β-d-allopyranoside (ECAP) is isolated from the 
popular Chinese herbal medicine Davallia formosana, which has been used to treat 
bone diseases including bone fracture, arthritis, and osteoporosis.
PURPOSE: To investigate the antiarthritic and the anti-inflammatory effect of 
ECAP on a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in vitro.
METHODS: Male DBA/1 J mice were immunized by administering an intradermal 
injection of 100 µg of type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant. The 
control groups (vehicle) and ECAP were administered orally at doses of 1 ml/kg 
(H2O), 50 and 100 mg/ml/kg once a day from Day 22 to Day 42 after primary 
immunization. Paw swelling, arthritis severity score, and histological changes 
were examined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the levels 
of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 
(IL)-10, IL-17, IL-4, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in splenocytes. Furthermore, the 
anti-inflammatory activities of ECAP were investigated in vitro by measuring 
nitric oxide (NO) levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW264.7 
macrophages.
RESULTS: In the CIA model, the oral administration of ECAP ameliorated paw edema 
and reduced the arthritis severity score and disease incidence. 
Histopathological examination demonstrated that ECAP treatment effectively 
protected the bone and cartilage of knee joints from erosion, lesion formation, 
and deformation compared with the vehicle treatment. ECAP also reduced IL-1β and 
MMP-9 expression in inflamed joints. Compared with the vehicle-treated mice with 
CIA, the reduced severity of the disease in ECAP-treated mice was associated 
with decreased levels of TNF-α and IL-17 and increased levels of IL-10 and IL-4 
in the supernatants of splenocyte cultures. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated 
that ECAP increased the population of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, thereby 
inhibiting the B cell population. Anticollagen IgG1 and IgG2a levels decreased 
in the serum of ECAP-treated mice. ECAP suppressed LPS-induced NO production in 
RAW264.7 macrophages.
CONCLUSION: The administration of ECAP effectively suppressed inflammation and 
inflammatory pain and adjuvant-induced arthritis, indicating its therapeutic 
potential in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and more recently, 
subcutaneously-delivered Ig (SCIg), are used to treat a variety of autoimmune 
diseases; however, there are challenges associated with product production, 
availability, access and efficacy. These challenges have provided incentives to 
develop a human recombinant Fc as a more potent alternative to IVIg and SCIg for 
the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Recently, a recombinant human IgG1 Fc 
hexamer (Fc-μTP-L309C) was shown to be more efficacious than IVIg in a variety 
of autoimmune mouse models. We have now examined its efficacy compared to IVIg 
and SCIg in the K/BxN mouse model of endogenous, chronic rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
RESULT: Using the serum-transfer K/BxN model and the endogenous autoimmune 
model, amelioration of the arthritis was achieved. Effective treatment required 
high and frequent doses of IVIg, SCIg and Fc-μTP-L309C. However, Fc-μTP-L309C 
was efficacious at 10-fold lower doses that IVIg/SCIg. Also, arthritis could be 
prevented when Fc-μTP-L309C was given prior to onset of the arthritis in both 
the endogenous model and in the serum transfer model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Fc-μTP-L309C is a powerful treatment for the 
prevention and amelioration of severe, chronic arthritis in a true autoimmune 
mouse model of RA. Thus, the K/BxN endogenous arthritis model should be useful 
for testing potential therapeutics for RA. Our findings provide rationale for 
further examination of the treatment efficacy of immunoglobulin-based 
therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased cardiovascular 
risk, secondary to endothelial dysfunction. There is accumulating evidence that 
methotrexate reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis, but the 
mechanisms involved are still unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the 
effect of methotrexate on endothelial function and traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors in the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model.
METHODS: On the first signs of arthritis, methotrexate (1 mg/kg/week, s.c.) or 
saline (Vehicle) was administered to AIA for 3 weeks. Endothelial function was 
studied in aortic rings relaxed with acetylcholine in the presence or not of 
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, arginase, EDHF and 
superoxide anions production. Arthritis and radiological scores, blood pressure 
and blood levels of cytokines, triglycerides, cholesterol, homocysteine and 
BMP-4 were measured.
RESULTS: Although methotrexate significantly reduced the arthritis score, it had 
no effect on Ach-induced relaxation. As regards mechanisms, methotrexate 
increased nitric oxide synthase activity and reduced the superoxide anions 
production but did not change arginase, cyclooxygenase-2 and EDHF pathways. 
Methotrexate did not change the radiological score or blood pressure, lipid, 
glucose and homocysteine levels. By contrast, methotrexate significantly reduced 
plasma IL-1β and TNF-α levels and increased serum BMP-4 level.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction of clinical and biological inflammation, 
methotrexate did not improve endothelial function in AIA rats. Overall data 
suggest that mechanisms other than the ED reduction are likely involved, and 
remain to be elucidated to better understand the cardiovascular benefits of 
methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: We applied systems biology approaches to investigate circadian 
rhythmicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: We recruited adults (age 16-80 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of 
RA (active disease [DAS28 > 3.2]). Sleep profiles were determined before 
inpatient measurements of saliva, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear 
leukocytes (PBML). Transcriptome and proteome analyses were carried out by 
RNA-SEQ and LC-MS/MS. Serum samples were analysed by targeted lipidomics, along 
with serum from mouse collagen induced-arthritis (CIA). Bioinformatic analysis 
identified RA-specific gene networks and rhythmic processes differing between 
healthy and RA.
RESULTS: RA caused greater time-of-day variation in PBML gene expression, and ex 
vivo stimulation identified a time-of-day-specific RA transcriptome. We found 
increased phospho-STAT3 in RA patients, and some targets, including 
phospho-ATF2, acquired time-of-day variation in RA. Serum ceramides also gained 
circadian rhythmicity in RA, which was also seen in mouse experimental 
arthritis, resulting from gain in circadian rhythmicity of hepatic ceramide 
synthases.
CONCLUSION: RA drives a gain in circadian rhythmicity, both in immune cells, and 
systemically. The coupling of distant timing information to ceramide synthesis 
and joint inflammation points to a systemic re-wiring of the circadian 
repertoire. Circadian reprogramming in response to chronic inflammation has 
implications for inflammatory co-morbidities and time-of-day therapeutics.

Management of pain in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a priority 
that is not fully addressed by the conventional therapies. In the present study, 
we evaluated the efficacy of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonist JWH-015 using 
RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) obtained from patients diagnosed with RA and in 
a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model of RA. Pretreatment of human RASFs 
with JWH-015 (10-20 μM) markedly inhibited the ability of pro-inflammatory 
cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to induce production of IL-6 and IL-8 and 
cellular expression of inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). JWH-015 was 
effective in reducing IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 (Thr184/187) and 
JNK/SAPK in human RASFs. While the knockdown of CB2 in RASFs using siRNA method 
reduced IL-1β-induced inflammation, JWH-015 was still effective in eliciting its 
anti-inflammatory effects despite the absence of CB2, suggesting the role of 
non-canonical or an off-target receptor. Computational studies using molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that JWH-105 favorably binds 
to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with the binding pose and interactions similar 
to its well-known ligand dexamethasone. Furthermore, knockdown of GR using siRNA 
abrogated JWH-015's ability to reduce IL-1β-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. In 
vivo, administration of JWH-015 (5 mg/kg, daily i.p. for 7 days at the onset of 
arthritis) significantly ameliorated AIA in rats. Pain assessment studies using 
von Frey method showed a marked antinociception in AIA rats treated with 
JWH-015. In addition, JWH-015 treatment inhibited bone destruction as evident 
from micro-CT scanning and bone analysis on the harvested joints and modulated 
serum RANKL and OPG levels. Overall, our findings suggest that CB2 agonist 
JWH-015 elicits anti-inflammatory effects partly through GR. This compound could 
further be tested as an adjunct therapy for the management of pain and tissue 
destruction as a non-opioid for RA.

OBJECTIVE: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) develop many years 
before the clinical onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was 
undertaken to address the molecular basis of the specificity and 
cross-reactivity of ACPAs from patients with RA.
METHODS: Antibodies isolated from RA patients were expressed as monoclonal 
chimeric antibodies with mouse Fc. These antibodies were characterized for 
glycosylation using mass spectrometry, and their cross-reactivity was assessed 
using Biacore and Luminex immunoassays. The crystal structures of the 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the monoclonal ACPA E4 in complex with 3 
different citrullinated peptides were determined using x-ray crystallography. 
The prevalence of autoantibodies reactive against 3 of the citrullinated 
peptides that also interacted with E4 was investigated by Luminex immunoassay in 
2 Swedish cohorts of RA patients.
RESULTS: Analysis of the crystal structures of a monoclonal ACPA from human RA 
serum in complex with citrullinated peptides revealed key residues of several 
complementarity-determining regions that recognized the citrulline as well as 
the neighboring peptide backbone, but with limited contact with the side chains 
of the peptides. The same citrullinated peptides were recognized by high titers 
of serum autoantibodies in 2 large cohorts of RA patients.
CONCLUSION: These data show, for the first time, how ACPAs derived from human RA 
serum recognize citrulline. The specific citrulline recognition and 
backbone-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the 
promiscuous recognition of citrullinated peptides by RA-specific ACPAs.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease of the joints that causes decreased 
quality of life. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have immunosuppressive 
properties, with possible use in the treatment of RA. Similarly, interleukin 
(IL)-4 has been shown as a potential RA treatment. However, their combination 
has not been explored before. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 
effect of a combination therapy of MSCs and IL-4 in the treatment of RA, using a 
murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Arthritis was induced in Balb/c 
mice by two intradermal injections of type II collagen (CII), at days 0 and 21. 
CIA mice were randomly assigned to four groups; group I received an intravenous 
injection of mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs, while group II received an 
intraperitoneal injection of IL-4. Group III received a combined treatment of 
MSC and IL-4, while group IV served as a CIA diseased control group receiving 
phosphate buffer saline (PBS). A fifth group of healthy mice served as the 
normal healthy control. To assess changes induced by different treatments, 
levels of RA-associated inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers were measured in 
the serum, knee joints, and synovial tissue, using ELISA and Real Time-qPCR. 
Histopathological features of knee joints were analyzed for all groups. Results 
showed that combined MSC and IL-4 treatment alleviated signs of synovitis in CIA 
mice, reverting to the values of healthy controls. This was evident by the 
decrease in the levels of rheumatic factor (RF), C-reactive protein (CRP) and 
anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) by 64, 80, and 71%, respectively, compared to the 
diseased group. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels decreased by 63 and 68%, respectively. 
Similarly, our gene expression data showed improvement in mice receiving 
combined therapy compared to other groups receiving single treatment, where 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Comp), tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 
(Timp1), matrix metalloproteinase1 (Mmp-1), and IL-1 receptor (Il-1r) gene 
expression levels decreased by 75, 70, and 78%, respectively. Collectively, 
treatment with a combined therapy of MSC and IL-4 might have an efficient 
therapeutic effect on arthritis. Thus, further studies are needed to assess the 
potential of different MSC populations in conjugation with IL-4 in the treatment 
of experimental arthritis.

Neural reflexes regulate inflammation and electrical activation of the vagus 
nerve reduces inflammation in models of inflammatory disease. These discoveries 
have generated an increasing interest in targeted neurostimulation as treatment 
for chronic inflammatory diseases. Data from the first clinical trials that use 
vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's 
disease suggest that there is a therapeutic potential of electrical VNS in 
diseases characterized by excessive inflammation. Accordingly, there is an 
interest to further explore the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential 
of electrical VNS in a range of experimental settings and available genetic 
mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a method for electrical VNS in 
experimental inflammation in mice.

Early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progress are of significant importance 
in the effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), because the continuing 
inflammation can lead to irreversible joint damage and systemic complications. 
However, applying imaging modalities for the prognosis of RA remains 
challenging, because no tissue-specific guidelines are available to monitor the 
progressive course of RA. In this study, fluorometric imaging of RA is reported 
using bioengineered targeted agents of the blood vessel, bone, and cartilage in 
combination with the customized optical fluorescence imaging system. Separate 
but simultaneous tissue-specific images of synovitis, cartilage destruction, and 
bone resorption are obtained from a mouse model of RA, which allows 
quantification of the prognosis of diseases at each stage. Thus, the 
fluorometric imaging of RA by using tissue-specific contrast agents plays a key 
role in the systemic treatment of RA by monitoring structural damage and disease 
progression.

Patients suffering from systemic autoimmune diseases are at significant risk of 
cardiovascular complications. This can be due to systemically increased levels 
of inflammation leading to accelerated atherosclerosis, or due to direct damage 
to the tissues and cells of the heart. Cardiac complications include an 
increased risk of myocardial infarction, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, 
valve disease, endothelial dysfunction, excessive fibrosis, and bona fide 
autoimmune-mediated tissue damage by autoantibodies or auto-reactive cells. 
There is, however, still a considerable need to better understand how to 
diagnose and treat cardiac complications in autoimmune patients. A range of 
inducible and spontaneous mouse models of systemic autoimmune diseases is 
available for mechanistic and therapeutic studies. For this Review, we 
systematically collated information on the cardiac phenotype in the most common 
inducible, spontaneous and engineered mouse models of systemic lupus 
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis. We also highlight 
selected lesser-known models of interest to provide researchers with a decision 
framework to choose the most suitable model for their study of heart involvement 
in systemic autoimmunity.

Aminopeptidase N/CD13 is expressed by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and 
monocytes (MNs) in inflamed human synovial tissue (ST). This study examined the 
role of soluble CD13 (sCD13) in angiogenesis, MN migration, phosphorylation of 
signaling molecules, and induction of arthritis. The contribution of sCD13 was 
examined in angiogenesis and MN migration using sCD13 and CD13-depleted 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluids (SFs). An enzymatically inactive 
mutant CD13 and intact wild-type (WT) CD13 were used to determine whether its 
enzymatic activity contributes to the arthritis-related functions. CD13-induced 
phosphorylation of signaling molecules was determined by Western blotting. The 
effect of sCD13 on cytokine secretion from RA ST and RA FLS was evaluated. sCD13 
was injected into C57BL/6 mouse knees to assess its arthritogenicity. sCD13 
induced angiogenesis and was a potent chemoattractant for MNs and U937 cells. 
Inhibitors of Erk1/2, Src, NF-κB, Jnk, and pertussis toxin, a G protein-coupled 
receptor inhibitor, decreased sCD13-stimulated chemotaxis. CD13-depleted RA SF 
induced significantly less MN migration than sham-depleted SF, and addition of 
mutant or WT CD13 to CD13-depleted RA SF equally restored MN migration. sCD13 
and recombinant WT or mutant CD13 had similar effects on signaling molecule 
phosphorylation, indicating that the enzymatic activity of CD13 had no role in 
these functions. CD13 increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by 
RA FLS, and a CD13 neutralizing Ab inhibited cytokine secretion from RA ST organ 
culture. Mouse knee joints injected with CD13 exhibited increased circumference 
and proinflammatory mediator expression. These data support the concept that 
sCD13 plays a pivotal role in RA and acute inflammatory arthritis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Celastrol exhibits anti-arthritic effects in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), but the role of celastrol-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in 
treatment of RA remains undefined. Here, we describe a regulatory role for 
celastrol-induced Ca2+ signalling in synovial fibroblasts of RA patients and 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used computational docking, Ca2+ dynamics and 
functional assays to study the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 
pump (SERCA). In rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs)/rheumatoid 
arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS), mechanisms of Ca2+ -mediated 
autophagy were analysed by histological, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric 
techniques. Anti-arthritic effects of celastrol, autophagy induction, and growth 
rate of synovial fibroblasts in AIA rats were monitored by microCT and 
immunofluorescence staining. mRNA from joint tissues of AIA rats was isolated 
for transcriptional analysis of inflammatory genes, using siRNA methods to study 
calmodulin, calpains, and calcineurin.
KEY RESULTS: Celastrol inhibited SERCA to induce autophagy-dependent 
cytotoxicity in RASFs/RAFLS via Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase 
kinase-β-AMP-activated protein kinase-mTOR pathway and repressed arthritis 
symptoms in AIA rats. BAPTA/AM hampered the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness 
of celastrol. Inflammatory- and autoimmunity-associated genes down-regulated by 
celastrol in joint tissues of AIA rat were restored by BAPTA/AM. Knockdown of 
calmodulin, calpains, and calcineurin in RAFLS confirmed the role of Ca2+ in 
celastrol-regulated gene expression.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Celastrol triggered Ca2+ signalling to induce 
autophagic cell death in RASFs/RAFLS and ameliorated arthritis in AIA rats 
mediated by calcium-dependent/-binding proteins facilitating the exploitation of 
anti-arthritic drugs based on manipulation of Ca2+ signalling.

A mounting evidence exists for the despicable role of the aberrant immune 
response in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) can activate synovial fibroblasts that lead to the chronic 
inflammation and joint destruction, thus making TLR4 a potent drug target in RA. 
We report that novel TLR4-antagonizing peptide, PIP2, inhibits the induction of 
inflammatory biomarkers in vitro as well as in vivo. Systemically, PIP2 inhibits 
the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-elicited TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12p40 in a mouse 
model. The rationally designed cyclic derivative, cPIP2, is capable of 
inhibiting LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines at significantly lower 
concentration as compared to PIP2 (PIP2 IC50 = 20 μM, cPIP2 IC50 = 5 μM). 
Finally, cPIP2 was able to relieve the inflammatory symptoms and synovial tissue 
destruction in the RA rat model. Cumulatively, these data suggest that PIP2 and 
cPIP2 hold strong promise for the development of peptide-based 
immunotherapeutics that could be of great value in curbing TLR-related immune 
complications including RA.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that 
causes inflammation, swelling, and pain in the joints and involves systemic 
complications. Mouse models of RA have been extensively used to model the 
pathogenesis of RA and to develop effective therapies. Although many components 
of the immune system have been studied in these models, the role of 
crystallizable fragment (Fc) gamma receptors (FcγRs) in RA has been sorely 
neglected. The aim of this review was to introduce the different mouse models of 
RA and to describe the different drug development strategies that have been 
tested in these models to target FcγR function, with the focus being on drugs 
that have been made from the Fc of immunoglobulin G (IgG).
SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that FcγRs play a major role in immune 
complex-induced inflammation in autoimmune diseases, such as RA. However, there 
is limited knowledge on the importance of FcγRs in the human disease even though 
there has been extensive work in mouse models of RA. Numerous mouse models of RA 
are available, with each model depicting certain aspects of the disease. Induced 
models of RA have nonspecific immune activation with cartilage-directed 
autoimmunity, whereas spontaneous models of RA develop without immunization, 
which results in a more chronic form of arthritis. These models have been used 
to test FcγR-targeting monoclonal antibodies, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), 
subcutaneously administered IVIg, and recombinant Fcs for their ability to 
interact with and modify FcγR function. Recombinant Fcs avidly bind FcγRs and 
exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of RA. Key Message: The 
therapeutic utility of targeting FcγRs with recombinant Fcs is great and should 
be explored in human clinical trials for autoimmune diseases, such as RA.

BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of the ability of microRNAs (miRs) in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), thus our objective was to discuss the impact of 
miR-365 on the apoptosis and proliferation of synoviocytes in mice with RA by 
targeting IGF1 and mediating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
METHODS: RA model mice was induced by type II collagen and freund's adjuvant. 
The successfully modeled mice were injected with normal saline, miR-365 mimics, 
miR-365 inhibitors or their controls. TUNEL assay was adopted to detect 
apoptosis in synovial tissues, and expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in serum and 
synovial tissues was measured by ELISA and RT-qPCR. Mouse synoviocytes were 
isolated and cultured in vitro and identified by experiments. Cells were 
transfected with miR-365 mimics, IGF1 siRNA, or their controls to verify the 
role of miR-365 and IGF1 in cell vitality, proliferation and apoptosis of 
synoviocytes.
RESULTS: Upregulation of miR-365 increased the number of TUNEL positive cells, 
depressed arthritis index, X-ray imaging score, and the expression of IL-1β and 
IL-6. High expression of miR-365 and low expression of IGF1 restrained the 
proliferation and facilitated apoptosis of synoviocytes. MiR-365 inhibited the 
expression of IGF1 and inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our study presents that up-regulation of miR-365 drives on apoptosis 
and restrains proliferation of synoviocytes in RA through downregulation of IGF1 
and the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, miR-365 may be a 
potential candidate for treatment of RA.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether activated protein C (APC), a physiological 
anticoagulant can inhibit the inflammatory/invasive properties of immune cells 
and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) in vitro and prevent 
inflammatory arthritis in murine antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and CIA models.
METHODS: RASFs isolated from synovial tissues of patients with RA, human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and mouse thymus cells were treated 
with APC or TNF-α/IL-17 and the following assays were performed: RASF 
proliferation and invasion by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cell invasion assays, respectively; cytokines and 
signalling molecules using ELISA or western blot; Th1 and Th17 phenotypes in 
human PBMCs or mouse thymus cells by flow cytometry. The in vivo effect of APC 
was evaluated in AIA and CIA models.
RESULTS: In vitro, APC inhibited IL-1β, IL-17 and TNF-α production, 
IL-17-stimulated cell proliferation and invasion and p21 and nuclear factor κB 
activation in RASFs. In mouse thymus cells and human PBMCs, APC suppressed Th1 
and Th17 phenotypes. In vivo, APC inhibited pannus formation, cartilage 
destruction and arthritis incidence/severity in both CIA and AIA models. In CIA, 
serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α and soluble endothelial protein C 
receptor were significantly reduced by APC treatment. Blocking endothelial 
protein C receptor, the specific receptor for APC, abolished the early or 
preventative effect of APC in AIA.
CONCLUSION: APC prevents the onset and development of arthritis in CIA and AIA 
models via suppressing inflammation, Th1/Th17 phenotypes and RASF invasion, 
which is likely mediated via endothelial protein C receptor.

Autoimmune diseases resulting from MHC class II-restricted autoantigen-specific 
T cell immunity include the systemic inflammatory autoimmune conditions 
rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis. While currently treated with broad-acting 
immunosuppressive drugs, a preferable strategy is to regulate antigen-specific 
effector T cells (Teffs) to restore tolerance by exploiting DC antigen 
presentation. We targeted draining lymph node (dLN) phagocytic DCs using 
liposomes encapsulating 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and antigenic 
peptide to elucidate mechanisms of tolerance used by DCs and responding T cells 
under resting and immunized conditions. PD-L1 expression was upregulated in dLNs 
of immunized relative to naive mice. Subcutaneous administration of liposomes 
encapsulating OVA323-339 and calcitriol targeted dLN PD-L1hi DCs of immunized 
mice and reduced their MHC class II expression. OVA323-339/calcitriol liposomes 
suppressed expansion, differentiation, and function of Teffs and induced Foxp3+ 
and IL-10+ peripheral Tregs in an antigen-specific manner, which was dependent 
on PD-L1. Peptide/calcitriol liposomes modulated CD40 expression by human DCs 
and promoted Treg induction in vitro. Liposomes encapsulating calcitriol and 
disease-associated peptides suppressed the severity of rheumatoid arthritis and 
Goodpasture's vasculitis models with suppression of antigen-specific memory T 
cell differentiation and function. Accordingly, peptide/calcitriol liposomes 
leverage DC PD-L1 for antigen-specific T cell regulation and induce 
antigen-specific tolerance in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.

Objective: To investigate the potential role of β-galactosidase in altering 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) galactosylation in serum of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).Methods: The expression level and activity of β-galactosidase in serum and 
CD 19+ B cells were measured by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The 
effect of β-galactosidase on the N-glycan changes in serum from mice 
intravenously treated with β-galactosidase was observed by linear ion-trap 
quadrupole-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LTQ-ESI-MS). We 
established a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model to explore the 
biological function of β-galactosidase in RA.Results: The expression level of 
β-galactosidase in serum of 32 patients was elevated when compared with those of 
30 healthy controls. The activity and expression level of β-galactosidase in 
CD19+ B cells from RA patients was higher than those from healthy controls. The 
ratio of m/z 1142/937 was reduced in mice treated with β-galactosidase when 
compared with normal mice. We found that β-galactosidase was implicated in the 
development of inflammation by affecting body weight and elevating the 
expression level of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and rheumatoid 
factor in the serum.Conclusions: Our results suggested the high level of 
β-galactosidase in B cells and serum of RA patients and revealed that altered 
β-galactosidase may be implicated in the progression of inflammation.

Bioactive peptides are attractive candidates for drug development. QAW is a 
tripeptide that is obtained from an anti-inflammatory protein-Annexin A1 
(ANXA1). Previous studies showed that QAW alleviated inflammation in 
experimental colitis and inflammatory bowel disease via NF-κB inhibition. This 
study establishes adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mouse models and explores the 
anti-inflammatory efficacy of QAW in AIA mice. To enhance the targeting, 
responsiveness, and efficacy of QAW to inflammation, QAW (Q) is modified with a 
cell penetrating peptide (T), a matrix metalloproteases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) digestive 
peptide (M), and an inflammation targeting peptide-RGD (R). The designed RMTQ 
demonstrates enhanced delivery to cytoplasm, higher reduction of 
pro-inflammatory factors, and better efficacy than QAW. The anti-inflammatory 
efficacy of RMTQ is similar to that of DEX in this study whereas RMTQ treatment 
shows a higher safety than that of DEX. In sum, this study demonstrates that 
RMTQ can be a potential therapeutic for inflammatory arthritis.

Caulophyllum robustum Maxim (CRM) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM) mainly present in the northeast, northwest and southwest regions of China, 
which is belong to the family Berberidaceae. The roots and rhizomes of CRM have 
been used as a famous TCM for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
selective, sensitive and accurate high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) 
method for the determination and pharmacokinetic study cauloside H, leonticin D, 
cauloside G, cauloside D, cauloside C and magnoflorine in rat plasma was 
developed and validated in this paper. Chromatographic separation was achieved 
by using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) with gradient 
elution using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1 % formic acid in 
water at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The detection was performed in multiple 
reaction monitoring (MRM) mode and electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and 
negative modes. The linearity, precision, accuracy, extraction recovery, matrix 
effects and stability were assessed to validate the current high-performance 
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) assay. Good linearity was 
achieved for each analyte with a correlation coefficient (r2) > 0.99). All the 
precision (RSD) data were less than 12.20 %, the accuracies ranged from -12.39 % 
to 10.55 %, the recovery rates from the rat plasma ranged from 85.48%-98.69 %, 
and the matrix effects ranged from 80.96 % to 91.35 %. The validated approach 
was successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
saponins and alkaloids in plasma after administering CRME to rats, and this 
assay provides a platform for studying the active components of multicomponent 
traditional Chinese medicines and provides useful information for further 
clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Bone destruction is one of many severe complications that occurs in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and current therapies are unable to cure 
this manifestation. This study here aims to determine whether GMSC can directly 
inhibit osteoclast formation and eventually attenuate osteoclastogenesis and 
bone erosion in an inflammatory milieu.
METHOD: GMSC were co-cultured with osteoclast precursors with or without CD39 
inhibitor, CD73 inhibitor or adenosine receptors inhibitors pretreatment and 
osteoclast formation were evaluated in vitro. 2×10^6 GMSC per mouse were 
transferred to CIA mice and pathology scores, the frequency of osteoclasts, bone 
erosion in joints were assessed in vivo.
FINDING: GMSC but not control cells, markedly suppressed human or mice 
osteoclastogenesis in vitro. GMSC treatment also resulted in a dramatically 
decreased level of NF-κB p65/p50 in osteoclasts in vitro. Infusion of GMSC to 
CIA significantly attenuated the severity of arthritis, pathology scores, 
frequency of osteoclasts, particularly bone erosion, as well as a decreased 
expression of RANKL in synovial tissues in vivo. Blockade of CD39/CD73 or 
adenosine receptors has significantly abrogated the suppressive ability of GMSC 
in vitro and therapeutic effect of GMSC on bone erosion during CIA in vivo.
INTERPRETATION: GMSC inhibit osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo partially 
via CD39-CD73-adenosine signals. Manipulation of GMSC may have a therapeutic 
implication on rheumatoid arthritis and other bone erosion related diseases. 
FUND: This study was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of 
China (2017YFA0105801 to F.H); the Zhujiang Innovative and Entrepreneurial 
Talent Team Award of Guangdong Province (2016 ZT 06S 252 to F·H) and National

Isoagglutinin-reduced immunoglobulin retains efficacy in mouse models of immune 
thrombocytopenia and rheumatoid arthritis and is less likely to cause 
intravenous immunoglobulin-associated hemolysis.

BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin therapy including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
has been used as an effective treatment for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions 
with few side effects. However, high-dose IVIg (1-2 g/kg) has been recognized as 
a cause of hemolytic anemia in non-blood group O patients. Hemolysis when 
observed has been due to anti-A/anti-B isoagglutinins contained in the IVIg. 
Recently, an isoagglutinin-reduced IVIg, whereby the anti-A and anti-B titers 
have been reduced by immunoaffinity chromatography, has been introduced; 
however, whether this new product is as efficacious as nonreduced immunoglobulin 
(Ig) or will result in less IVIg-associated hemolysis has not been resolved.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used in vitro phagocytosis by monocytes and 
proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory macrophages, with isoagglutinin-reduced and 
-nonreduced Ig opsonized group A1 , B, and A1 B red blood cells, to estimate 
clinical significance of the IgG isoagglutinins. We also used immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse models to examine the 
in vivo efficacy of isoagglutinin-reduced versus -nonreduced Ig on the 
amelioration of the diseases.
RESULTS: In contrast to nonreduced Ig, phagocytosis was largely absent when 
isoagglutinin-reduced Ig was used at a concentration equivalent to a patient 
receiving 2 g/kg. The in vivo efficacy of isoagglutinin-reduced versus 
nonreduced Ig on the amelioration of experimental ITP and RA was similar, 
indicating no loss of efficacy due to the chromatographic removal of 
isoagglutinins.
CONCLUSION: Isoagglutinin-reduced Ig should have efficacy similar to nonreduced 
Ig and result in less IVIg-associated hemolysis.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) contribute to 
the development of chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease. In this study, 
we assessed the ILC function in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), we identified and 
purified the ILC subsets in peripheral blood (PB), local lymph nodes (LNs), and 
joints by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and used quantitative PCR to 
assess the expression levels of representative cytokines. We also correlated the 
frequencies of each ILC subset in synovial fluid (SF) with clinical parameters 
in RA patients.
RESULTS: In the CIA model, the proportion of CCR6+ ILC3s to total ILCs in joints 
with active inflammation significantly increased relative to non-arthritic 
joints (median 29.6% vs 16.7%, p = 0.035). CCR6+ ILC3s from mice with arthritis 
expressed significantly higher levels of IL-17A and IL-22 mRNA than did 
comparable cells from control mice (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.015). In RA patients, 
the proportion of CCR6+ ILCs in SF was positively correlated with tender joint 
counts (TJC) and swollen joint counts (SJC) (ρ=0.689, p = 0.0032 and ρ=0.644, 
p = 0.0071, respectively). Levels of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) increased in 
SF of patients with RA and were significantly correlated with CCR6+ ILC number 
(ρ=0.697, p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: CCR6+ ILC3s may play some roles in the development of RA through the 
production of IL-17 and IL-22.

PURPOSE: Given to the anti-inflammatory effect of Nicotine and Thymol, this 
study was done to evaluate the effects of co-administration of Nicotine and 
Thymol on the clinical aspects, and immunity responses in Freund's complete 
adjuvant (FCA)-induced RA in Wistar rat.
METHODS: The study population contained a total of 50 male Wistar rats with a 
weight range 150 ± 7 g, which RA was induced through FCA at them. These animals 
were randomly allocated into five groups (n = 10): RA rats treated with PBS 
(100 mg/kg orally), RA rats treated with Thymol (100 mg/kg orally), RA rats 
treated with Nicotine (2.5mg/kg-orally), and RA rats treated with combined 
Nicotine and Thymol (half doses with each one-orally). All treatments were 
initiated at day seven p.i. when all rats showed a clinical score of ≥1. 
Clinical symptoms of the disease were recorded every other day until the day 23 
p.i.
RESULTS: Obtained data revealed the combination therapy reduced the severity of 
the disease and improved weight-gaining more profound than each medication 
alone. Furthermore, combination therapy caused a reduction in some hematological 
and biochemical RA parameters, such as Rheumatoid factor, C-Reactive Protein, 
Nitric oxide, Myeloperoxidase, IL-1, and IL-17 more impressive than each 
treatment alone. Interestingly, the combination therapy with half doses of 
Nicotine and Thymol did not have any synergistic advantage in anti-proliferation 
effect, and therefore immunosuppression side effect compared with using each of 
agents alone.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, it is possible that combination therapy can be applied 
as a beneficial strategy to control RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by synovial 
inflammation in multiple joints. Autoantibodies (Abs) are the hallmark of RA, 
and as disease-specific and diagnostic markers, rheumatoid factor and 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) are produced pre-clinically, but 
their pathogenic roles in RA remain elusive. In this review, we focus on one of 
the candidate autoantigens in RA; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). The 
arthritogenic role of GPI has been confirmed in two different mouse models: the 
K/BxN- and GPI-induced arthritis models. Both anti-GPI Abs and citrullinated-GPI 
peptide Abs have been detected in human RA. Studies conducted in these rodent 
models have confirmed that the pathogenesis of arthritis involves the 
localization of autoantigens not only in the joints but also in the circulation. 
In this review, we revisit and summarize the arthritogenic relevance of GPI in 
animal RA models and in human RA, and extend the discussion to joint-specific 
inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Pain is a debilitating symptom of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), caused 
by joint inflammation and cartilage and bone destruction. Nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain and inflammation in RA, 
but are not disease-modifying and do not prevent joint destruction when 
administered alone. KBPs (Key Bioscience peptides) are synthetic peptides based 
on salmon calcitonin and are expected to inhibit bone resorption and to be 
chondroprotective. In this study, we investigated if combining a standard of 
care NSAID (naproxen) with a KBP resulted in improvement in pain scores, as well 
as disease activity and structural damage in a rat model of RA.
METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in 40 female Lewis rats by 
immunization with porcine type II collagen; 10 rats were given sham injections. 
CIA rats were treated with KBP and/or naproxen. Health scores and joint scores 
were evaluated daily. Mechanical and cold allodynia tests and burrowing tests 
were used to assess pain-like behaviors. Blood samples were collected for 
biomarker testing, and paws were collected for histology and microcomputed 
tomography.
RESULTS: Naproxen monotherapy increased the time until humane endpoints was 
reached, and improved health score, pain assessments, and trabecular thickness, 
while KBP monotherapy did not result in improvements. Combination therapy had 
improved efficacy over naproxen monotherapy; combination therapy resulted in 
improved health scores, and importantly reduced mechanical and cold allodynia 
assessment. Furthermore, protection of articular cartilage structure and 
preservation of bone structure and bone volume were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that combining KBP and naproxen may be a 
relevant therapeutic strategy for RA, resulting in improvements to the overall 
health, pain, inflammation, and joint structure.

OBJECTIVES: Most therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases either 
neutralize or suppress production of inflammatory cytokines produced by 
activated macrophages (e.g., TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, GM-CSF). However, no 
approved therapies directly target this activated subset of macrophages.
METHODS: First, we undertook to examine whether the folate receptor beta (FR-β) 
positive subpopulation of macrophages, which marks the inflammatory subset in 
animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, might constitute the prominent population 
of macrophages in inflamed lesions in humans. Next, we utilized anti-FR-β 
monoclonal antibodies capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) to treat animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis.
RESULTS: Human tissue samples of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, 
ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nonspecific interstitial 
pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
psoriasis, and scleroderma are all characterized by dramatic accumulation of 
macrophages that express FR-β, a protein not expressed on resting macrophages or 
any other healthy tissues. A monoclonal antibody to FR-β accumulates 
specifically in inflamed lesions of murine inflammatory disease models and 
successfully treats such models of rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis. More 
importantly, elimination of FR-β-positive macrophages upon treatment with an 
anti-FR-β monoclonal antibody promotes the departure of other immune cells, 
including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells from the inflamed 
lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that specific elimination of FR-β-expressing 
macrophages may constitute a highly specific therapy for multiple autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases and that a recently developed human anti-human FR-β 
monoclonal antibody (m909) might contribute to suppression of this subpopulation 
of macrophages.

Shexiang-Wulong Pill (SWP) is derived from "Moschus Yuan," first formulated 
during the Song Dynasty for the treatment of joint pain. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SWP in a mouse model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Forty-five DBA/1 mice were randomly divided 
into control group, model group, and SWP-treated group. SWP was administered by 
oral gavage for 22 days after the booster immunization. The clinical arthritic 
scores and joint histopathology, including synovial hyperplasia and hypoxic 
regions, cartilage erosion, and bone destruction, were evaluated. Microcomputed 
tomography (micro-CT) was used to assess microstructural changes in the bone. 
Serum levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IFN-γ were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed a statistically significant 
improvement in joint pathological changes in the SWP-treated group. Imaging 
assessment confirmed that SWP protected the bone tissue from CIA-induced erosion 
and increased the bone density. In addition, the serum levels of TNF-a, IL-6, 
and IFN-γ in SWP-treated mice were significantly lower than those in the model 
group (P<0.05). Taken together, Shexiang-Wulong Pill can effectively alleviate 
joint swelling in CIA mice, inhibit synovial tissue hyperplasia, reduce 
inflammatory cell infiltration, and delay bone destruction. These results 
indicate that Shexiang-Wulong Pills could be an efficient medication for the 
treatment of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes 
irreversible damage to the joints. However, effective drugs exist that can stop 
disease progression, leading to intense interest in early detection and 
treatment monitoring to improve patient outcomes. Imaging approaches have the 
potential for early detection, but current methods lack sensitivity and/or are 
time-consuming and expensive. We examined potential routes for 
self-administration of molecular imaging agents in the form of subcutaneous and 
oral delivery of an integrin binding near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging 
agent in an animal model of RA with the long-term goal of increasing safety and 
patient compliance for screening. NIR imaging has relatively low cost, uses 
non-ionizing radiation, and provides minimally invasive spatial and molecular 
information. This proof-of-principle study shows significant uptake of an 
IRDye800CW agent in inflamed joints of a collagen antibody induced arthritis 
(CAIA) mouse model compared to healthy joints, irrespective of the method of 
administration. The imaging results were extrapolated to clinical depths in 
silico using a 3D COMSOL model of NIR fluorescence imaging in a human hand to 
examine imaging feasability. With target to background concentration ratios 
greater than 5.5, which are achieved in the mouse model, these probes have the 
potential to identify arthritic joints following oral delivery at clinically 
relevant depths.

BACKGROUND: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and CCR7- effector memory T (TEM) 
cells are two of the major cell types implicated in the progression of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In particular, FLS become highly invasive, whereas 
TEM cells proliferate and secrete proinflammatory cytokines, during RA. FLS and 
T cells may also interact and influence each other's phenotypes. Inhibition of 
the pathogenic phenotypes of both FLS and TEM cells can be accomplished by 
selectively blocking the predominant potassium channels that they upregulate 
during RA: KCa1.1 (BK, Slo1, MaxiK, KCNMA1) upregulated by FLS and Kv1.3 (KCNA3) 
upregulated by activated TEM cells. In this study, we investigated the roles of 
KCa1.1 and Kv1.3 in regulating the interactions between FLS and TEM cells and 
determined if combination therapies of KCa1.1- and Kv1.3-selective blockers are 
more efficacious than monotherapies in ameliorating disease in rat models of RA.
METHODS: We used in vitro functional assays to assess the effects of selective 
KCa1.1 and Kv1.3 channel inhibitors on the interactions of FLS isolated from 
rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with syngeneic TEM cells. We also 
used flow cytometric analyses to determine the effects of KCa1.1 blockers on the 
expression of proteins used for antigen presentation on CIA-FLS. Finally, we 
used the CIA and pristane-induced arthritis models to determine the efficacy of 
combinatorial therapies of KCa1.1 and Kv1.3 blockers in reducing disease 
severity compared with monotherapies.
RESULTS: We show that the interactions of FLS from rats with CIA and of rat TEM 
cells are regulated by KCa1.1 and Kv1.3. Inhibiting KCa1.1 on FLS reduces the 
ability of FLS to stimulate TEM cell proliferation and migration, and inhibiting 
Kv1.3 on TEM cells reduces TEM cells' ability to enhance FLS expression of 
KCa1.1 and major histocompatibility complex class II protein, as well as 
stimulates their invasion. Furthermore, we show that combination therapies of 
selective KCa1.1 and Kv1.3 blockers are more efficacious than monotherapies at 
reducing signs of disease in two rat models of RA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the importance of KCa1.1 and Kv1.3 in 
regulating FLS and TEM cells during RA, as well as the value of combined 
therapies targeting both of these cell types to treat RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease that affects the osteoarticular 
system, associated with bone fragility and increased risk of fractures. Herein, 
we aimed to characterize the systemic impact of the rat collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) model and explore its combination with femoral bone defect (FD). 
The impact of CIA on endogenous mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) was also 
investigated. CIA induction led to enlarged, more proliferative, spleen and 
draining lymph nodes, with altered proportion of lymphoid populations. Upon FD, 
CIA animals increased the systemic myeloid cell proportions, and their 
expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. Screening plasma 
cytokine/chemokine levels showed increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-12 in CIA, and IL-2 and IL-6 increased 
in CIA and CIA+FD, while Fractalkine and Leptin were decreased in both groups. 
CIA-derived MSC showed lower metabolic activity and proliferation, and 
significantly increased osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation markers. 
Exposure of control-MSC to TNF-α partially mimicked the CIA-MSC phenotype in 
vitro. In conclusion, inflammatory conditions of CIA led to alterations in 
systemic immune cell proportions, circulating mediators, and in endogenous MSC. 
CIA animals respond to FD, and the combined model can be used to study the 
mechanisms of bone repair in inflammatory conditions.

Mutations of the genes encoding T-cell receptor (TCR)-proximal signaling 
molecules, such as ZAP-70, can be causative of immunological diseases ranging 
from T-cell immunodeficiency to T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. For example, 
SKG mice, which carry a hypomorphic point mutation of the Zap-70 gene, 
spontaneously develop T-cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis immunopathologically 
similar to human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The Zap-70 mutation alters the 
sensitivity of developing T cells to thymic positive/negative selection by 
self-peptides/MHC complexes, shifting self-reactive TCR repertoire to include a 
dominant arthritogenic specificity and also affecting thymic development and 
function of autoimmune suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Polyclonal 
self-reactive T cells, including potentially arthritogenic T cells, thus 
produced by the thymus recognize self-peptide/MHC complexes on 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the periphery and stimulate them to produce 
cytokines including IL-6 to drive the arthritogenic T cells to differentiate 
into arthritogenic T-helper 17 (Th17) cells. Insufficient Treg suppression or 
activation of APCs via microbial and other environmental stimuli evokes 
arthritis by activating granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor-secreting effector Th17 cells, mediating chronic bone-destructive joint 
inflammation by activating myeloid cells, innate lymphoid cells, and 
synoviocytes in the joint. These findings obtained from the study of SKG mouse 
arthritis are instrumental in understanding how arthritogenic T cells are 
produced, become activated, and differentiate into effector T cells mediating 
arthritis, and may help devising therapeutic measures targeting autoimmune 
pathogenic Th17 cells or autoimmune-suppressing Treg cells to treat and prevent 
RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a highly inflammatory autoimmune disease. Although 
proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 
(IL)-6, play a key role in the pathogenesis of RA, the causes of chronic 
inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that protein phosphatase 
magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A) levels were increased in RA synovial fluid 
compared with osteoarthritis (OA) synovial fluid and positively correlated with 
TNF levels. In addition, PPM1A expression was increased in synovial tissue from 
RA patients and joint tissue from a mouse model of arthritis. Finally, 
extracellular PPM1A induced inflammation by stimulating macrophages to produce 
TNF through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary 
response protein 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that 
extracellular PPM1A may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA by functioning as a 
damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) to induce inflammation.

During rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, long-term injection of antitumor 
necrosis factor α antibodies (anti-TNFα Abs) may induce on-target toxicities, 
including severe infections (tuberculosis [TB] or septic arthritis) and 
malignancy. Here, we used an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) hinge as an Ab lock to 
cover the TNFα-binding site of Infliximab by linking it with matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP) -2/9 substrate to generate pro-Infliximab that can be 
specifically activated in the RA region to enhance the selectivity and safety of 
treatment. The Ab lock significantly inhibits the TNFα binding and reduces the 
anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) Ab binding to pro-Infliximab by 395-fold, 108-fold 
compared with Infliximab, respectively, and MMP-2/9 can completely restore the 
TNFα neutralizing ability of pro-Infliximab to block TNFα downstream signaling. 
Pro-Infliximab was only selectively activated in the disease site (mouse paws) 
and presented similar pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bio-distribution to Infliximab. 
Furthermore, pro-Infliximab not only provided equivalent therapeutic efficacy to 
Infliximab but also maintained mouse immunity against Listeria infection in the 
RA mouse model, leading to a significantly higher survival rate (71%) than that 
of the Infliximab treatment group (0%). The high-selectivity pro-Infliximab 
maintains host immunity and keeps the original therapeutic efficiency, providing 
a novel strategy for RA therapy.

Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a soluble pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is mainly 
secreted by Th17 cells. In humans, IL-17A mRNA and protein levels are increased 
in several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
This study describes the preclinical in vitro and in vivo characterization of 
GR1501, a human IL-17A-neutralizing IgG4 monoclonal antibody. GR1501 binds 
human, rhesus and cynomolgus IL-17A with high affinity but does not bind to 
mouse IL-17A or other IL-17 family members. GR1501 effectively blocks the 
interaction between IL-17A and its receptor IL-17RA, thereby inhibiting 
IL-17A-induced CXCL1 and IL-6 release in cells and mice. In mouse air pouch 
model, GR1501 effectively inhibits IL-17A induced leukocytes infiltration into 
the air pouch. GR1501 also reduces joint swelling and inflammation in mouse 
arthritis model. These data suggest that GR1501 is a potent and selective 
IL-17A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody and will support the clinical 
investigation of this monoclonal antibody in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Genetic variants in C5orf30 have been associated with development of the 
autoimmune conditions primary biliary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In 
rheumatoid arthritis, C5orf30 expression is cell-specific, with highest 
expression found in macrophages and synovial fibroblasts. C5orf30 is highly 
expressed in inflamed joints and is a negative regulator of tissue damage in a 
mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Transcriptomic analysis from 
ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy of inflamed joints in a well characterized 
clinical cohort of newly diagnosed, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs-naive 
rheumatoid arthritis patients was used to determine the clinical association of 
C5orf30 expression with disease activity. A combined molecular and computational 
biology approach was used to elucidate C5orf30 function in macrophages both in 
vitro and in vivo. Synovial expression of C5orf30 is inversely correlated with 
both clinical measures of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and with 
synovial TNF mRNA expression. C5orf30 plays a role in regulating macrophage 
phenotype and is differentially turned over in inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory macrophages. Inhibition of C5orf30 reduces wound 
healing/repair-associated functions of macrophages, reduces signaling required 
for resolution of inflammation, and decreases secretion of anti-inflammatory 
mediators. In an animal model of wound healing (zebrafish), C5orf30 inhibition 
increases the recruitment of macrophages to the wound site. Finally, we 
demonstrate that C5orf30 skews macrophage immunometabolism, demonstrating a 
mechanism for C5orf30-mediated immune regulation.

INTRODUCTION: Abnormal glycolytic metabolism contributes to joint inflammation 
and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examine the expression and 
function of hexokinases in RA and evaluate the potential of their specific 
inhibitor for clinical treatment.
METHODS: Detection of HKs was assessed in synovial tissue by immunohistology and 
Western blot. SiRNA and a specific hexokinases inhibitor, lonidamine (LND), were 
used to evaluate the role of hexokinase-I/II (HK-I/II). Pro-inflammatory and 
glycolysis factors, cell viability, and apoptosis were assessed by ELISA, 
RT-qPCR, MTS, and flow cytometry. The clinical effects of LND on type II 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA-/1 mouse model was evaluated by scoring 
their clinical responses, synovitis, and cartilage destructions, and ELISA was 
employed to analyze the concentrations of antibody in the serum of CIA model.
RESULTS: HK-I/II expression and their activities increased in the synovium of RA 
compared with osteoarthritis (OA). Silencing HK-I/II (siHK-I/II) or LND 
treatment decreased the production of pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, 
IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, and cell viability, but induced cell apoptosis 
of RASFs. The expression of TNF-α and IL-1β of macrophage in response to LPS 
stimulation were depressed as well after treatment with siHK-I/II or LND. 
Furthermore, leucocyte infiltration co-cultured with RASFs was also suppressed 
after inhibiting the expression or activity of HK-I/II. These anti-inflammatory 
effects overlapped with their anti-glycolytic activities. Treatment with LND in 
mice with CIA decreased the production of antibodies against IgG1, IgG2a, and 
IgG2b and consequently attenuated joint inflammation and destruction.
CONCLUSIONS: HK-I/II contribute to shape the inflammatory phenotype of RASFs and 
macrophages. LND may be a potential drug in treating patients with RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of synovial 
inflammation and joint destruction. This study reports anti-arthritic potential 
of opuntioside-I opuntiol, and its gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs) against 
Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritic rats. The mechanistic studies 
were performed targeting TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) 
expressions to validate their anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory response. 
The nano-formulations were successfully characterized employing Atomic Force 
Microscopy (AFM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis. Opuntiol and 
opuntioside (OP and OPG: 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg) and opuntiol-coated silver and 
gold NPs (OP-AgNPs and OP-AuNPs: 0.5, 1 and 3 mg/kg) treatments in arthritic rat 
have shown minimal arthritic score exhibiting mild to moderate articular changes 
and tissue swelling in ankle joints. Radiographic examination reveals 
significant reduction in synovitis with improvement in joints degenarative 
changes in the presence of aforementioned treatments. Likewise, histology of rat 
ankle joints depicted comparatively lesser influx of inflammatory cells and 
diminished granulamatous inflammation. Moreover, treatment groups suppressed 
protein and mRNA expressions of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (IL-1β and 
TNF-α) levels were also significantly declined in the presence of OPG, OP and 
its NPs comparing to arthritic control. This investigation concludes, the tested 
compounds and nano-formulations successfully restored the disease progression in 
CFA-induced arthritic rat owing to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory 
potentials and can be considered for RA targeted therapy to address the utmost 
challenges of the disease.

Background: Transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) curing rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) for long-term treatment can improve patients' compliance and reduce the 
accumulation of drug side effects. However, TDDS is constrained by the tight 
junction of the stratum corneum and low permeation efficiency. It is necessary 
to adopt proper permeation methods to ensure the therapeutic effect. The 
transethosome (TE), which is derived from transfersome and ethosome (E), 
containing a high content of ethanol along with an edge activator or permeation 
enhancer, has superior deformability and higher permeation efficiency. Methods 
and Results: In this study, sinomenine hydrochloride-loaded TE was decorated 
with ascorbic acid to form antioxidant surface transethosome (AS-TE). It was 
revealed that TE and AS-TE containing sodium deoxycholate can effectively 
increase the entrapment efficiency of hydrophilic drug, and has superior 
deformability and higher permeation efficiency than E group. The plasma 
pharmacokinetics of rabbits showed that TE group and AS-TE group had similar 
blood concentration and bioavailability; however, micro-dialysis on synovial 
fluid demonstrated that AS-TE group had higher drug concentration. In RA rat 
models, the alleviation of the joint swell of AS-TE group was more obvious in 
the course of 3 weeks of treatment. The inflammatory cytokines and erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate were significantly lower than those in the negative control 
group and TE1 group. Conclusion: AS-TE, which can enhance transdermal 
permeability and drug deposition for the oxidant stress of RA, had further 
research potential to serve as a TDDS of RA.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may display atypical CD21-/lo B cells in 
their blood, but the implication of this observation remains unclear. We report 
here that the group of patients with RA and elevated frequencies of CD21-/lo B 
cells shows decreased ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) expression and 
activation in B cells compared with other patients with RA and healthy donor 
controls. In agreement with ATM involvement in the regulation of V(D)J 
recombination, patients with RA who show defective ATM function displayed a 
skewed B cell receptor (BCR) Igκ repertoire, which resembled that of patients 
with ataxia telangiectasia (AT). This repertoire was characterized by increased 
Jκ1 and decreased upstream Vκ gene segment usage, suggesting improper secondary 
recombination processes and selection. In addition, altered ATM function in B 
cells was associated with decreased osteoprotegerin and increased receptor 
activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) production. These changes favor 
bone loss and correlated with a higher prevalence of erosive disease in patients 
with RA who show impaired ATM function. Using a humanized mouse model, we also 
show that ATM inhibition in vivo induces an altered Igκ repertoire and RANKL 
production by immature B cells in the bone marrow, leading to decreased bone 
density. We conclude that dysregulated ATM function in B cells promotes bone 
erosion and the emergence of circulating CD21-/lo B cells, thereby contributing 
to RA pathophysiology.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-21 on 
rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through the Wnt signaling pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 rats were divided into three groups: 
control group (healthy rats, n=10), model group (rat model of RA, n=10), and MiR 
group (rat model of RA injected with miR-21 lentivirus, n=10). The paw volume, 
arthritis indexes, and protein expression level in each group were analyzed by 
means of paw volume and arthritis index measurement, reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and fluorescent Western 
blotting.
RESULTS: The expression levels of inflammatory factors declined in MiR group 
compared with those in model group, while they were higher in model group than 
those in control group and MiR group (p<0.05). At 15 d after transfection with 
lentivirus, the paw volume in MiR group was smaller than that in model group, 
which was decreased markedly with the extended time of transfection (p<0.05). On 
the 30th d, MiR group had a remarkably smaller paw volume than model group. In 
comparison with that in control group, the paw volume in model group was 
increased notably from the 7th d and displayed a significant difference in the 
30th d (p<0.05). The arthritis indexes in MiR group were lower than those in 
model group; however, there were no apparent inflammations at the joints at 15 d 
after drug administration. Moreover, the longer the time of drug administration 
was, the less apparent the inflammations at the joints will be. The 
inflammations at the joints were ameliorated evidently on the 30th d in MiR 
group (p<0.05). Compared with those in control group, the inflammations in model 
group were increased significantly from the 7th d, with significant differences 
in the 30th d (p<0.05). The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and Wnt in MiR group were higher than those in 
control group, but lower than those in model group (p<0.05), while they were 
higher in model group than those in control group (p<0.05). The expression level 
of Wnt protein was decreased in MiR group compared with that in model group 
(p<0.05), and model group had a prominently elevated expression level of Wnt 
protein in comparison with control group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-21 overexpression can repress the expressions of IL-6 and IL-8 
and relieve the symptoms of RA by down-regulating the Wnt signal.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complicated chronic multisystem autoimmune 
disease, wherein the inflammatory cascade leads to vasospasm and 
osteoclastogenesis, which ultimately results in bone and cartilage destruction. 
In this study, we investigated the expression and localization of the alpha-7 
nicotinic receptor (α7nAchR) gene CHRNA7 in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, 
kidney, and joints of the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. The CHRNA7 
mRNA and protein expression levels in these tissues of rats from CIA and normal 
groups were analyzed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. The cellular localization of 
CHRNA7 protein was determined via immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. CHRNA7 was 
expressed at varying levels in different tissues of rats from the groups, among 
which joints showed significantly higher CHRNA7 expression levels than other 
tissues (P < 0.05). CIA rats had significantly higher CHRNA7 expression levels 
in the spleen and joints than the control group rats (P < 0.05). Positive 
expression signals for CHRNA7 were detected in various tissues of CIA and 
control group rats, among which strong positive signals were detected in joint 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), endothelial cells, stromal cells, and 
macrophages. Our results further confirmed the involvement of the CAP in the 
onset and development of inflammatory responses in RA, suggesting that CHRNA7 
may be a new therapeutic target for RA. This study is of great clinical and 
theoretical significance for understanding the differential expression of CHRNA7 
in various tissues and cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)-targeted 
treatment of RA.

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells 
present in the synovial tissue secrete numerous inflammatory mediators including 
pro-inflammatory cytokines critical for the induction of chronic joint 
inflammation and bone destruction. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in the 
non-hematopoietic cell compartment are key inflammatory cells activated in 
inflamed joints and driving the disease; yet how synovial tissue inflammation is 
modulated by autoimmune T cells is not fully understood. In this review, mainly 
based on recent findings with a mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune arthritis, 
we discuss the mechanism of Th17-mediated synovial tissue inflammation; that is, 
what environmental stimuli and arthritogenic self-antigens trigger arthritis, 
how arthritogenic T cells initiate joint inflammation by stimulating FLSs, and 
how the cellular sources of GM-CSF from lymphoid and tissue stromal cells in the 
synovium contribute to the development of arthritis. We also highlight possible 
plasticity of Th17 cells toward pathogenic GM-CSF producers, and the functional 
instability of regulatory T cells under inflammatory conditions in RA joints.

BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis model (CIA) rats were treated by tail vein 
injection of IL-10-modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to 
investigate its feasibility and intrinsic molecular mechanism. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS The CIA rat model was established by induction type II collagen, and 
IL-10-modified BMSCs was established by transfecting BMSCs with adenovirus. 
IL-10-modified BMSCs were used to treat the CIA rats. The therapeutic effect was 
evaluated by measuring the changes in body weight, ankle swelling, and forced 
swimming time, as well as observation of synovial hyperplasia and cartilage 
tissue repair by HE staining. Western blot analysis and ELISA were used to 
detect gene expression. RESULTS After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment with 
IL10-BMSCs, the body weight, swelling value, resting time, and forced swimming 
struggle time of CIA rats were significantly higher than those of BMSCs-treated 
and -untreated CIA rats (P<0.05). Compared to BMSCs-treated CIA model rats, 
after treatment with IL10-BMSCs, the repair rate of osteoarticular cartilage was 
higher and the inhibition of synovial proliferation was better, and serum IL-17, 
IL-1ß, and TNF-alpha levels were lower. We found that the protein level of SIRT1 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was lower, the protein level in spleen was 
higher, and phosphorylation of p65 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
was reduced. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of tail vein injection of IL-10-modified 
BMSCs in treatment of CIA rats was superior to that of BMSCs alone, which may be 
related to the more pronounced suppression of IL-10-modified BMSCs in peripheral 
blood inflammation and spleen immune response.

BACKGROUND: Diallyl Trisulfide (DATS) is an organosulfur compound extracted from 
garlic bulb, and exerts cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
antimicrobial and anticancer effects. But its role in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. Here we explored the influence of DATS on 
human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from RA patients and a mouse 
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: RA-FLS were cultured and treated with different concentrations of DATS. 
The CCK8 assay was used to assess cell proliferation while cell apoptosis was 
detected by flow cytometry and western blot. The IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1β levels 
were determined using RT-qPCR and ELISA assay. The expression of proteins of the 
NF-κB and Wnt pathways were measured using western blot. Furthermore, the effect 
of DATS was also explored in vivo using the collagen-induced arthritis mouse 
model. The Th17/Treg pattern obtain from cells of spleen of collagen-induced 
arthritis mouse model was detected by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Our results showed that DATS could decrease cell viability and 
introduce apoptosis in RA-FLS. Furthermore, DATS significantly attenuated the 
production of key inflammatory cytokines induced by RA-FLS cells following 
treatment with tumor necrosis α (TNF-α) at a concentration of 100 μM or higher. 
This was due to its inhibitory effect on the NF-κB and Wnt pathway signaling in 
RA-FLS. Additionally, DATS decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines 
and regulated the immune function by restoring the balance between Th17 and Treg 
in CIA mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, DATS may serve as a potential curative agent for RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes pain and tissue 
destruction in people worldwide. An accurate diagnosis is paramount in order to 
develop an effective treatment plan. This study demonstrates that combining near 
infrared (NIR) imaging and 19F MRI with the injection of labelled nanoparticles 
provides high diagnostic specificity for RA. The nanoparticles were made from 
poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (NP) or 
PLGA-PEG-Folate (Folate-NP), loaded with perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) and 
indocyanine green (ICG) and evaluated in vitro and in a collagen-induced 
arthritic (CIA) mouse model. The different particles had a similar size and a 
spherical shape according to dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM). Based on flow cytometry and 19F MRI analysis, 
Folate-NP yielded a higher uptake than NP in activated macrophages in vitro. The 
potential RA-targeting ability of the particles was studied in CIA mice using 
NIR and 19F MRI analysis. Both NP and Folate-NP accumulated in the RA tissues, 
where they were visible in NIR and 19F MRI for up to 24 hours. The presence of 
folate as a targeting ligand significantly improved the NIR signal from inflamed 
tissue at the early time point (2 hours), but not at later time points. Overall, 
these results suggest that our nanoparticles can be applied for combined NIR and 
19F MRI imaging for improved RA diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Development of autoimmune diseases is the result of a complex 
interplay between hereditary and environmental factors, with multiple genes 
contributing to the pathogenesis in human disease and in experimental models for 
disease. The T-box protein 3 is a transcriptional repressor essential during 
early embryonic development, in the formation of bone and additional organ 
systems, and in tumorigenesis.
METHODS: With the aim to find novel genes important for autoimmune inflammation, 
we have performed genetic studies of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse 
experimental model for rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS: We showed that a small genetic fragment on mouse chromosome 5, 
including Tbx3 and three additional protein-coding genes, is linked to severe 
arthritis and high titers of anti-collagen antibodies. Gene expression studies 
have revealed differential expression of Tbx3 in B cells, where low expression 
was accompanied by a higher B cell response upon B cell receptor stimulation in 
vitro. Furthermore, we showed that serum TBX3 levels rise concomitantly with 
increasing severity of CIA.
CONCLUSIONS: From these results, we suggest that TBX3 is a novel factor 
important for the regulation of gene transcription in the immune system and that 
genetic polymorphisms, resulting in lower expression of Tbx3, are contributing 
to a more severe form of CIA and high titers of autoantibodies. We also propose 
TBX3 as a putative diagnostic biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis.

In order to discover novel anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of arthritis 
and based on preliminary structure-activity relationships, four series (A-D) of 
total 90 new pyrazolo[4,3- d]pyrimidine compounds were designed and synthesized. 
All the compounds have been tested for their anti-inflammatory activities by 
inhibiting of LPS-induced NO production. A clear structure-activity relationship 
has been concluded step by step, and finally 3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl-1 
H-pyrazolo[4,3- d]pyrimidine was found to be the most active scaffold. Among 
them, compound D27 was discovered as the most potent anti-inflammatory agent 
(IC50 = 3.17 μM) with low toxicity and strong inhibitory of NO release (IR = 
90.4% at 10 μM). This compound also showed potent inhibition of iNOS with IC50 
value of 1.12 μM. Preliminary mechanism studies indicated that it could 
interfere with the stability and formation of active dimeric iNOS. The 
anti-inflammatory effect of this compound was determined by adjuvant-induced 
arthritis in rat model. We believe these findings would further support the 
study of rational design of more efficient iNOS inhibitors in the future.

BACKGROUND: Thymoquinone (TQ), the most important active principle of Nigella 
sativa is known to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial and 
antioxidant properties.
AIM: The present study was designed to see the anti-arthritic effect of TQ in 
rat model of arthritis.
METHODS: In the current research, anti-arthritic effect of TQ was determined in 
Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritic rats by measuring TLRs 
expression levels. The mRNA expression levels of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), 
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin-1 (IL-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) 
and tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by reverse-transcription 
polymerase chain reaction. Arthritic signs were observed by macroscopic 
criteria. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining was used to perform ankle joint 
histopathology and agglutination method was used for measuring C-reactive 
protein (CRP) levels. Rheumatoid factor, alanine transaminase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, urea and creatinine were also determined in serum.
RESULTS: TQ treatment reduced the macroscopic arthritic score, levels of CRP, 
synovial inflammation, pannus formation and bone erosion. It also reduced the 
mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, IL-1, NFκB and TNF-α. Methotrexate, used as a 
reference drug also significantly decreased their expression levels. TQ also 
normalized the hematological markers and did not depict any signs of 
hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity as determined by serum levels of alanine 
transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea and creatinine. Our results 
showed that TQ possesses significant anti-arthritic activity which can be due to 
its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that TQ has got the potential to ameliorate 
rheumatoid arthritis by downregulating TLR2, TLR4, TNF-α, IL-1, and NFκB 
expression levels.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can, in severe 
cases, lead to disability. CC chemokine receptor (CCR), an integral membrane 
protein, has been suggested to play a key role in the RA developmentThis study 
is to explore the role of CCR5 silencing in inflammatory response, viability, 
and apoptosis of synovial cells in RA rats by inactivating the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Microarray analysis was conducted to 
screen out differentially expressed genes from RA-related chips. The rat model 
was established by injection of siRNA-CCR5 and PD98059 (inhibitor of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1) to evaluate the role of CCR5 
silencing in RA, with the involvement of inflammatory response, synovial cell 
viability, apoptosis, and cycle. CCR5 was predicted to participate in RA by 
regulating the MARK pathway. In animal experiments, reduction was identified in 
arthritis index (AI), CCR5 positive expression rate, levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and 
MMP-3 in serum of RA rats after CCR5 siRNA and PD98059 injections. RA rats 
treated with CCR5 siRNA, and PD98059 presented with inhibition in cell 
viability, promotion of apoptosis, increase in cell proportion in G0/G1 phase, 
and shortened the S phase. In addition, the treatment of CCR5 siRNA, and PD98059 
resulted in downregulated JNK1, ERK1, p38, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin B1, and 
Bcl-2 and upregulated Bax and Cas3. These findings reveal that CCR5 silencing 
suppresses inflammatory response, inhibits viability, and promotes apoptosis of 
synovial cells in RA rats by inhibiting MAPK pathway. Therefore, CCR5 silencing 
may provide a novel therapeutic target for RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that causes 
progressive chronic inflammation of the joints and destruction of articular 
cartilage and bone erosion. Cartilage destruction is a key characteristic in 
patients with RA. RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) mainly contributes to 
local production of cytokines, inflammatory mediators and MMPs, and to migrate 
and destruct joint cartilage. Here, we summarized a detailed protocol for 
developing a humanized synovitis animal model. A cartilage-sponge complex 
without RA FLS was implanted under the left flank skin of a SCID mouse 
primarily, two weeks later, cartilage-sponge complex containing RA FLS was 
inserted under the right skin of the contralateral flank. The H&E staining 
clearly helps to identify the cartilage damage on the day 45 after second 
implantation. This model is highly significant to investigate the role and 
mechanisms of agents or cells in targeting RA FLS in vivo.

: To study new target-oriented molecules that are active against rheumatoid 
arthritis-dependent pain, new dual inhibitors incorporating both a carbonic 
anhydrase (CA)-binding moiety and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (NSAID) were tested 
in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis induced by CFA intra-articular (i.a.) 
injection. A comparison between a repeated per os treatment and a single i.a. 
injection was performed. CFA (50 µL) was injected in the tibiotarsal joint, and 
the effect of per os repeated treatment (1 mg kg-1) or single i.a injection (1 
mg ml-1, 50 µL) with NSAIDs-CAIs hybrid molecules, named 4 and 5, was evaluated. 
The molecules 4 and 5, which were administered daily for 14 days, significantly 
prevented CFA-induced hypersensitivity to mechanical noxious (Paw pressure test) 
and non-noxious stimuli (von Frey test), the postural unbalance related to 
spontaneous pain (Incapacitance test) and motor alterations (Beam balance test). 
Moreover, to study a possible localized activity, 4 and 5 were formulated in 
liposomes (lipo 4 and lipo 5, both 1 mg ml-1) and directly administered by a 
single i.a. injection seven days after CFA injection. Lipo 5 decreased the 
mechanical hypersensitivity to noxious and non-noxious stimuli and improved 
motor coordination. Oral and i.a. treatments did not rescue the joint, as shown 
by the histological analysis. This new class of potent molecules, which is able 
to inhibit at the same time CA and cyclooxygenase, shows high activity in a 
preclinical condition of rheumatoid arthritis, strongly suggesting a novel 
attractive pharmacodynamic profile.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of 
atractylodin, a polyethylene alkyne, on the maturation of bone marrow-derived 
dendritic cells (BM-DC) as well as its antirheumatic effect on collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1 mice. Our results indicate that atractylodin 
effectively suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression 
of costimulatory molecules, and p38 MAPK, ERK, and NF-κBp65 signaling pathways 
in LPS-incubated dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, the proliferation and 
cytokine secretion (IFN-γ and IL-17A) of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were reduced. In 
a murine CIA model, intraperitoneal injection of atractylodin significantly 
alleviated the severity of the disease progression, as indicated by reduced paw 
swelling, clinical arthritis scores, and pathological changes of joint tissues. 
In addition, the overall proliferation of T cells stimulated by type II collagen 
and the abundance of Th1 and Th17 in the spleens were also significantly 
decreased with atractylodin treatments. Furthermore, atractylodin significantly 
downregulated the expression levels of CD40, CD80, and CD86 of DCs in the 
spleens. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that atractylodin 
has potential to manipulate the maturation of BM-DCs and should be further 
explored as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease. The 
imbalance of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 immune responses contributes to the 
pathogenesis of this disease. Germacrone is a major bioactive component isolated 
from Rhizoma Curcuma with multiple bioactivities including anti-inflammation. 
However, the role and mechanism of germacrone in RA are still unknown. 
Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was established in male DBA/1 J mice by 
two immunizations with chicken collagen II. Germacrone was orally administered 
once per day starting on the day of second immunization for 3 weeks. Arthritis 
scoring was evaluated every 3 days after second immunization. H&E staining was 
used for histopathological examination. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 in serum and synovial tissues of mice 
were detected by ELISA. Th1 and Th2 cell percentage in mouse spleens was 
analyzed by flow cytometry. IκB and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (p-p65) 
expression in mouse synovial tissues was assayed by Western blot. We found 
germacrone treatment significantly reduced arthritis score and inflammation in 
CIA mice. Levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ were elevated, and IL-4 reduced, in the 
serum and synovial tissues of CIA mice. Germacrone partially reversed levels of 
these cytokines. Moreover, germacrone decreased the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells in 
mouse spleens. Additionally, germacrone remarkably enhanced IκB expression, but 
suppressed p-p65 level in CIA mice. Taken together, these results suggest that 
germacrone alleviated the progression of arthritis that might be related to the 
regulation of Th1/Th2 balance and inactivation of NF-κB pathway.

Dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression may result in the development 
of severe pathologies, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Transgenic mice and, in particular, those with 
controllable systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines have recently 
become an essential instrument to study the molecular mechanisms underlying 
disease development. Importantly, many of the models are humanized by 
introducing a human cytokine gene, while leaving or removing the respective 
endogenous mouse gene. Humanized mice are especially valuable for biomedical 
research as they provide a relevant model to develop therapies based on blocking 
the pathogenic activity of a cytokine or to establish the functional 
significance of genome polymorphisms. The review discusses the available 
humanized mouse models with overexpression of key proinflammatory cytokines 
(TNF, IL-ip, and IL-6) and inflammatory cytokines with more specific functions 
(IL-8, IL-17, and IL-32) and their significance for basic and clinical research.

Specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes result in a high 
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with co-stimulatory molecules 
working together with MHC class II during the progression of the disease. To 
elucidate the involvement of the B7.1 co-stimulatory molecule in RA, we analyzed 
the phenotype of B7.1 transgenic (named D1BC) mice and the sequential 
differentiation of synovial fibroblasts (SFs) by studying the expression of 
chondrogenic and osteogenic lineage markers together with lineage tracing 
experiment using B7.1 transgene in vivo. The B7.1 transgene was driven by a 
collagen type II (CII) promoter and enhancer in the D1BC mouse. A low-dose of 
bovine CII (bCII) was used to induce chronic articular inflammation with 
interstitial pneumonitis. Joint damage was analyzed by histopathological 
examination and computed tomography. B7.1 was expressed in articular cartilage 
and SFs of D1BC mice. Chronic inflammatory arthritis in the bCII-D1BC mouse 
shared common features with those found in patients with RA, such as pannus 
formation, bone destruction, osteoporosis, and joint ankylosis. A subpopulation 
of SFs (Runx2 +, Sox9 +, Col10a1 +, Osx+, and CX-) in the pannus was classified 
as osteochondrogenic lineage rather than mesenchymal stromal lineage. These 
cells underwent differentiation into osteogenic lineage via hypertrophic 
chondrocytes at the end of the chronic phase. The ectopic expression of B7.1 in 
chondrocytes and SFs leads to an increased susceptibility to chronic 
inflammatory arthritis and subsequent new bone formation, reminiscent of 
ankylosis. The regulation of cartilage remodeling in pannus tissue is an 
important consideration in the treatment of RA.

BACKGROUND: Activin A and follistatin exhibit immunomodulatory functions, thus 
affecting autoinflammatory processes as found in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
impact of both proteins on the behavior of synovial fibroblasts (SF) in RA as 
well as in osteoarthritis (OA) is unknown.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses of synovial tissue for expression of 
activin A and follistatin were performed. The influence of RASF overexpressing 
activin A on cartilage invasion in a SCID mouse model was examined. RASF and 
OASF were stimulated with either IL-1β or TNFα in combination with or solely 
with activin A, activin AB, or follistatin. Protein secretion was measured by 
ELISA and mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Smad signaling was confirmed by western 
blot.
RESULTS: In human RA synovial tissue, the number of activin A-positive cells as 
well as its extracellular presence was higher than in the OA synovium. Single 
cells within the tissue expressed follistatin in RA and OA synovial tissue. In 
the SCID mouse model, activin A overexpression reduced RASF invasion. In human 
RASF, activin A was induced by IL-1β and TNFα. Activin A slightly increased IL-6 
release by unstimulated RASF, but decreased protein and mRNA levels of 
follistatin.
CONCLUSION: The observed decrease of cartilage invasion by RASF overexpressing 
activin A in the SCID mouse model appears to be mediated by an interaction 
between activin/follistatin and other local cells indirectly affecting RASF 
because activin A displayed certain pro-inflammatory effects on RASF. Activin A 
even inhibits production and release of follistatin in RASF and therefore 
prevents itself from being blocked by its inhibitory binding protein follistatin 
in the local inflammatory joint environment.

BACKGROUND: Despite major advances in rheumatoid arthritis outcome, not all 
patients achieve remission, and there is still an unmet need for new therapeutic 
approaches. This study aimed at evaluating in a pre-clinical murine model the 
efficacy of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, and to provide a relevant study model for dissecting ECP mechanism of 
action in autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: DBA/1 mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of bovine collagen 
type II, in order to initiate the development of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). Arthritic mice received 3 ECP treatments every other day, with 
psoralen + UVA-treated (PUVA) spleen cells obtained from arthritic mice. 
Arthritis score was measured, and immune cell subsets were monitored.
RESULTS: ECP-treated mice recovered from arthritis as evidenced by a decreasing 
arthritic score over time. Significant decrease in the frequency of Th17 cells 
in the spleen of treated mice was observed. Interestingly, while PUVA-treated 
spleen cells from healthy mouse had no effect, PUVA-treated arthritic mouse 
derived-spleen cells were able to induce control of arthritis development.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ECP can control arthritis in CIA-mice, 
and clarifies ECP mechanisms of action, showing ECP efficacy and Th17 decrease 
only when arthritogenic T cells are contained within the treated sample. These 
data represent a pre-clinical proof of concept supporting the use of ECP in the 
treatment of RA in Human.

Kirenol is a diterpenoid extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine 
Siegesbeckiae. Siegesbeckiae has been used to treat Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
China for several centuries. RA is characterized by the proliferation of 
synoviocytes in inflamed synovia, as well as by their expression of inflammatory 
cytokines. In the present study, we found that Kirenol inhibited the migration, 
invasion, and proinflammatory of IL-6 secretion of RA-associated synovial 
fibroblasts (FLS) at a concentration of 100-200 μg/ml in vitro. Proinflammatory 
cytokines production and synovium hyperplasia and cartilage erosion were also 
inhibited in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model upon Kirenol 
treatment. Together, our results thus confirm that Kirenol has potent 
therapeutic efficacy in RA owing to its ability to suppress negative FLS 
activities.

BACKGROUND: Inhibiting TNF-α is an effective therapy for inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, systemic, nondiscriminatory 
neutralization of TNF-α is associated with considerable adverse effects.
METHODS: Here, we developed a trimeric chimeric TNF receptor by linking an 
N-terminal mouse Acrp30 trimerization domain and an MMP-2/9 substrate sequence 
to the mouse extracellular domain of TNF receptor 2 followed by a C-terminal 
mouse tetranectin coiled-coil domain (mouse Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn).
RESULTS: Here, we show that the Acrp30 trimerization domain inhibited the 
binding activity of TNFR, possibly by closing the binding site of the trimeric 
receptor. Cleavage of the substrate sequence by MMP-9, an enzyme highly 
expressed in inflammatory sites, restored the binding activity of the mouse TNF 
receptor. We also constructed a recombinant human chimeric TNF receptor (human 
Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn) in which an MMP-13 substrate sequence was used to link the 
human Acrp and the human TNF receptor 2. Human Acrp-MMP-TNFR-Tn showed reduced 
binding activity, and MMP-13 digestion recovered its binding activity with 
TNF-α.
CONCLUSION: Acrp-masked chimeric TNF receptors may be able to be used for 
inflammatory tissue-selective neutralization of TNF-α to reduce the adverse 
effects associated with systemic neutralization of TNF-α.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, and cartilage and bone destruction. 
Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1) functions as a 
transcriptional repressor and plays a vital role in inflammatory reactions. 
However, whether NR1D1 is involved in synovial inflammation and joint 
destruction during the pathogenesis of RA is unknown. In this study, we found 
that NR1D1 expression was increased in synovial tissues from patients with RA 
and decreased in RA Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) stimulated with IL-1β in 
vitro. We showed that NR1D1 activation decreased the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), while NR1D1 
silencing exerted the opposite effect. Furthermore, NR1D1 activation reduced 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased the production of nuclear 
transcription factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-associated enzymes. 
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways 
were blocked by the NR1D1 agonist SR9009 but activated by NR1D1 silencing. NR1D1 
activation also inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and suppressed 
osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-related genes expression. Treatment with NR1D1 
agonist SR9009 in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse significantly 
suppressed the hyperplasia of synovial, infiltration of inflammatory cell and 
destruction of cartilage and bone. Our findings demonstrate an important role 
for NR1D1 in RA and suggest its therapeutic potential.

Comparison of the Therapeutic Effects of Gold Nanoclusters and Gold 
Nanoparticles on Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Zhao Y, He Z, Wang R, Cai P, Zhang X, Yuan Q, Zhang J, Gao F, Gao X.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
synovial inflammation and progressive cartilage and bone damage. In our previous 
studies, we found that Au clusters using glutathione as a template (GACs) 
produced profound anti-inflammatory effects in vitro on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced inflammation in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and type II 
collagen-induced rat RA in vivo. In this study, we examined whether the template 
for Au clusters synthesis has an effect on its anti-inflammatory effect and 
whether Au nanoparticles with larger particle diameter produce the same 
anti-inflammatory effect. We synthesized Au clusters with bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) as a template (BACs), Au clusters with glutathione (GSH) as a template 
(GACs), and Au nanoparticles with glutathione as a template (GANs) and compared 
their anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. These three Au 
nanomaterials can inhibit the production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
proinflammatory mediators and ameliorate type II collagen-induced rat RA. 
However, although the three Au nanomaterials produced similar anti-inflammatory 
effects, the GANs with larger particle sizes were less stable in vivo and 
accumulated in the peritoneum after intraperitoneal injection, resulting in poor 
absorption in vivo. The BACs showed relatively high liver accumulation due to 
the larger molecular weight of the outer shell. Therefore, we believe that the 
GACs are potential reliable nanodrugs for the treatment of RA.

BACKGROUND Literature shows that serum selenium concentration is low in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Biochemical properties of nanoparticles 
(NPs) are depend in its medium dispersed. Biochemical properties could 
effectively alter the therapeutic potential of NPs. Phytochemicals could serve 
as suitable medium for dispersion of NPs. P-Coumaric acid (CA) known to have 
anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present experiment, we 
investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of SeNPs dispersed in 1% CA against 
Complete Freund's adjuvant induced RA. Celecoxib was used as a reference drug. 
RESULTS Selenium NPs (SeNPs) size is maintained in 1% CA solution. We observed 
that supplementation with 500 μg/Kg body weight (b.w.) eNPs significantly 
restored the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, COX-2 activity, 
different antioxidant enzyme activities, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) in RA rats. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes 
such as MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, ECSOD, CAT, and GPx1 was found to be downregulated, 
whereas COX-2 was upregulated in RA rats; however, the mRNA expression of CAT, 
GPx1, and COX-2 reverted back to near normal levels in SeNPs-treated animals. 
CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic potential of SeNPs was confirmed through 
histological observation of angle joints in different experimental animals. Our 
results collectively suggest that SeNPs dispersed in CA can be an effective 
therapeutic agent for inflammatory disorders like acute gouty arthritis.

Comment on
    Nature. 2019 May;569(7756):428-432.

The TNF blockade therapy is currently a well-established treatment option for a 
variety of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis or 
Crohn's disease, given the proinflammatory role of TNF in the course of these 
diseases. Importantly, TNF neutralization is also used for the treatment of 
corticosteroid-refractory immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by the 
combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. The manifestation of these 
toxicities is an important limiting factor for the successful implementation of 
the inhibitory checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB), restraining its anti-tumor 
efficacy. In our recent study (Perez-Ruiz et al., Nature 569(7756): 428-432.), 
we analyzed the potential impact of prophylactic TNF neutralization therapy in 
the anti-PD1/CTLA-4 efficacy. Through several mouse models, we demonstrated that 
TNF neutralization ameliorated ICB-exacerbated colitis in addition to improving 
ICB-dependent anti-tumor efficacy. Similar results were obtained after 
prophylactic TNF blockade in graft vs host xenografted mouse models with human 
immune cells, which showed a reduction in colitis and hepatitis. Importantly, 
there was a preservation of the immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumors 
after ICB treatment. Moreover, TNF and TNF-dependent gene expression is 
upregulated in the colon mucosa from patients affected by colitis as a side 
effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Our results, thus, provide evidence of the 
successful combination of prophylactic TNF neutralization with ICB therapy 
strategy to ameliorate toxicities, while keeping or even ameliorating anti-tumor 
efficacy. The prophylactic TNF blockade strategy is clinically feasible since 
excellent TNF inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmunity 
and are used for the immune-related serious adverse events in immunotherapy.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder, which 
may lead to joint disabilities. So far the pathogenesis of RA remains largely 
undetermined, and there are still no potent drugs for clinical treatment. Rhein, 
a natural bioactive anthraquinone derivative, exhibited significant 
anti-inflammatory activities demonstrated by previous studies. Here we aimed to 
investigate the effects of rhein on ATP-induced inflammation responses in 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes isolated from a rat model of collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA). Our results showed that ATP triggered rapid cytosolic calcium 
concentration ([Ca2+]c) increase depending on extracellular Ca2+ entry. Given 
the major P2 subtypes expressed in rat synoviocytes were P2X4 and P2Y2 
receptors, ATP-elicited calcium entry should be mainly resulted from activating 
P2X4. Interestingly, rhein could effectively block the ATP-induced [Ca2+]c 
increases in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, rhein also suppressed the 
production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ATP in 
synoviocytes that was resulted from P2X4-mediated Ca2+ entry. Brilliant blue G 
(BBG), which can block P2X4 receptor at high concentration, showed similar 
suppressive effects on above responses. Furthermore, in 
lipopolysaccharide-primed cells, application of ATP synergistically promoted the 
gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6 and matrix 
metalloproteinase-9. Both rhein and BBG attenuated these inflammatory gene 
expressions enhanced by ATP. Above data together suggested a potential 
anti-arthritic role of rhein by inhibiting ATP-induced [Ca2+]c increase, ROS 
production and inflammatory gene expression targeting P2X4 in CIA rat 
synoviocytes, which will provide a novel insight in the therapy of RA.

Triptolide has been widely reported to exhibit potential therapeutic value in 
multiple inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and psoriasis. Although its safety and efficacy as an 
anti-inflammatory agent have been verified by many studies, the effect of 
triptolide on osteoarthritis (OA) was not clearly understood. In this study, we 
found that triptolide prevented OA development in a surgical destabilization of 
the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. In addition, triptolide inhibited both 
DMM-induced and LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the 
human monocytic cell line THP-1. Further mechanistic studies showed that the 
reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by triptolide was mediated by the 
upregulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family 
pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and downregulation of caspase-1. 
Finally, we identified that hsa-miR-20b, a microRNA targeting the NLRP3 gene, 
was downregulated by triptolide. This study provides a novel insight into the 
effect on triptolide in preventing OA pathogenesis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes severe 
joints damage and other extra-articular alterations. Despite the efficacy of 
low-dose methotrexate (LD-MTX) in RA treatment, adverse effects are the 
predominant reasons for discontinuation of therapy. As a therapeutic targeting 
strategy, the presence of increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) in the inflammatory environment can serve as the stimulus for prodrug 
activation in site-selective drug delivery systems. Our group has previously 
reported novel ROS sensitive prodrugs (1-3) of MTX and aminopterin (AMT) for 
site-selective delivery to inflammatory tissue associated with RA, with the aim 
of reducing side effects in RA therapy. Herein, we investigate the effect and 
toxicity of the same prodrugs in a rat CIA (collagen-induced arthritis) model of 
RA. We find that prodrug 1, an arylboronic acid ROS-sensitive MTX-prodrug, 
displays similar in vivo efficacy as MTX at an equimolar dose, while avoiding 
adverse effects known to restrict MTX treatment. To further characterize prodrug 
1 and its ROS mediated activation, we synthesized compound 4, a negative control 
lacking the boronic acid moiety. We then investigated the effect of molecules on 
cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in the presence of the ROS scavenger 
pyruvate, as well as their stability in buffer and cell media, demonstrating a 
direct correlation between ROS concentration and the prodrug activity. Moreover, 
the in vitro ADME properties were investigated, including permeability, rat 
plasma and microsomal stability.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder where incidence and 
severity of myocardial infarction are increased. Data on the incidence and 
outcome of stroke are conflicting. Thus, we investigated outcome after 
Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) brain injury in a mouse model of RA and assessed for 
the role of the tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor Infliximab herein. We 
used a TNF-α reliant mouse model of RA. RA and wildtype (WT) animals were 
treated with vehicle (RA/WT) or Infliximab (RA Infliximab) for 4 weeks, before 
undergoing I/R brain injury. RA-animals displayed larger strokes and poorer 
neurological performance. Immunohistochemistry on brain sections revealed 
increased numbers of resident and peripheral innate immune cells (microglia and 
macrophages); increased Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB)-disruption; decreased levels 
of the tight junction proteins (TJPs) claudin-5 and occludin; increased 
expression of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 and -9 and enhanced lipid 
peroxidation. Treatment with Infliximab corrected these alterations. We show 
that RA associates to worse stroke-outcome via exacerbated BBB degradation by 
decrease of the TJPs claudin-5 and occludin. We identified MMPs-3 and -9 and 
increased oxidative stress as potential mediators thereof. Increased numbers of 
resident and peripheral innate immune cells (microglia and macrophages) may in 
turn contribute to all these effects. Infliximab-treatment restored the 
phenotype of RA-mice to baseline. Our data provide evidence clearly linking RA 
to adverse stroke-outcome in mice and indicate an approved TNF-α inhibitor as a 
potential strategy to reduce stroke-burden in this setting.

University, Kaifeng, Henan, China.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease that is 
associated with the aberrant activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). 
Kaempferitrin is a natural flavonoid glycoside that possesses anti-inflammatory 
bioactivity. However, the effect of kaempferitrin on RA has not yet been 
revealed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 
kaempferitrin on human RA-FLS MH7A cell line. We found that kaempferitrin 
inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of MH7A cells. Kaempferitrin 
decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and MMP-3 in MH7A cells. Moreover, 
kaempferitrin blocked the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and protein 
kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Furthermore, 
treatment with kaempferitrin decreased paw thickness and arthritis scores, and 
reduced the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in a collagen-induced 
arthritis mouse model. In conclusion, kaempferitrin inhibited cell 
proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and ameliorated inflammation of RA-FLS by 
suppressing the NF-κB and Akt/mTOR pathways.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study is to investigate the inhibitory 
effects of sinomenine (SIN) on angiogenesis in a collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) mouse model.
METHODS: Arthritis assessments for all mice were recorded. The histopathological 
assessments were performed following haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. 
Immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses were 
used to detect the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 1 (ANG-1) in the serum and in 
the membrane. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the synovium 
microvessel density (MVD).
RESULTS: Compared with the CIA model group, SIN significantly ameliorated 
swelling and erythema extension, decreased the arthritis index, reduced 
inflammation, cartilage damage and bone erosion, and lessened the number of CD31 
positive cells on the synovium. Moreover, the levels of HIF-1α, VEGF and ANG-1 
in the synovium and in the peripheral serum were increased in the untreated CIA 
model group but were significantly reduced in the 30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 
300 mg/kg SIN treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: SIN could mitigate CIA by inhibiting angiogenesis, and the mechanism 
may associate with the HIF-1α-VEGF-ANG-1 axis. Additionally, our study provides 
a referable experimental basis for the use of SIN for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Diseases of the joints affect over 10% of the world's population, resulting in 
significant morbidity. There is an unmet need in strategies for specific 
delivery of therapeutics to the joints. Collagen type II is synthesized by 
chondrocytes and is mainly restricted to the cartilage and tendons. 
Arthrogen-CIA is a commercially available anticollagen II antibody cocktail that 
reacts with 5 different epitopes on human, bovine, and mouse collagen II. 
Arthrogen has been used for induction of experimental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
in mice because of high complement activation on the cartilage surface. Native 
collagen II might serve as a useful target for potential delivery of 
therapeutics to the joint. To evaluate the efficiency and specificity of 
targeting collagen II, Arthrogen was labeled with near-infrared (NIR) dye IRDye 
800 or IRDye 680. Using ex vivo NIR imaging, we demonstrate that Arthrogen 
efficiently and specifically accumulated in the limb joints regardless of the 
label dye or injection route (intravenous and subcutaneous). After subcutaneous 
injection, the mean fluorescence of the hind limb joints was 19 times higher 
than that of the heart, 8.7 times higher than that of the liver, and 3.7 times 
higher than that of the kidney. Control mouse IgG did not show appreciable 
accumulation. Microscopically, the antibody accumulated on the cartilage surface 
of joints and on endosteal surfaces. A monoclonal antibody against a single 
epitope of collagen II showed similar binding affinity and elimination 
half-life, but about three times lower targeting efficiency than Arthrogen in 
vitro and ex vivo, and about two times lower targeting efficiency in vivo. We 
suggest that an antibody against multiple epitopes of collagen II could be 
developed into a highly effective and specific targeting strategy for diseases 
of the joints or spine.

Role of microRNA-26a in cartilage injury and chondrocyte proliferation and 
apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis rats by regulating expression of CTGF.

This study is carried out to investigate the role of microRNA-26a (miR-26a) in 
cartilage injury and chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis in rats with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by regulating expression of CTGF. A rat model of RA 
induced by type II collagen was established. The rats were assigned into normal, 
RA, RA + mimics negative control (NC), and RA + miR-26a mimics groups, and the 
cells were classified into blank, mimics NC, and miR-26a mimics groups. The 
degree of secondary joint swelling and arthritis index, expression of miR-26a, 
pathological changes, proliferation and apoptosis of chondrocytes, and 
expression of CTGF, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, Bax, 
and Bcl-2 were also determined through a series of experiments. The targeting 
relationship between miR-26a and CTGF was verified. Initially, downregulated 
miR-26a was found in cartilage tissues and inflammatory articular chondrocytes 
of RA rats. In addition, CTGF was determined as a direct target gene of miR-26a, 
and upregulation of miR-26a inhibited CTGF expression in cartilage tissues of RA 
rats. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-26a reduced swelling and inflammation of 
joints, inhibited cartilage damage, apoptosis of chondrocytes, inflammatory 
injury, promotes proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of inflammatory 
articular chondrocytes, which may be correlated with the targeting inhibition of 
CTGF expression. Collectively, the results demonstrate that upregulating the 
expression of miR-26a could attenuate cartilage injury, stimulate the 
proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis of chondrocytes in RA rats.

Purpose: Methotrexate (MTX) is a first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA)therapy. However, MTX monotherapy often results in irreversible joint damage 
due to its slow onset of action and long duration. microRNA-124 (miR-124) has 
shown direct bone protection activity against RA. A co-delivery system for MTX 
and microRNA combination may provide therapeutic synergy. Methods: 
Methotrexate-conjugated polymer hybrid micelles (M-PHMs) were prepared by 
self-assembly of two functional amphiphilic polymers (MTX-PEI-LA and mPEG-LA) at 
an optimized weight ratio. Incorporation of microRNA was achieved through 
electrostatic interactions between microRNA and cationic polymer MTX-PEI-LA. 
Cellular uptake, endosome escape, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy of 
M-PHMs/miR-124 complexes were investigated and evaluated in RAW264.7 cells and a 
rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. Results: M-PHMs/miR-124 complexes 
exhibited folate receptor-mediated uptake in activated RAW264.7 cells. miR-124 
was able to escape from the endosome and down-regulate nuclear factor of 
activated T cells cytoplasmic1 (NFATc1). M-PHMs/miR-124 complexes accumulated in 
inflamed joints of AIA rats and showed superior therapeutic efficacy through 
both anti-inflammatory effect and direct bone protective effect. Combination of 
miR-124 and MTX in these micelles induced disease remission. Conclusions: 
M-PHMs/miR-124 was highly effective against RA through therapeutic synergy. 
Additional studies are warranted to further investigate its therapeutic 
potential and delineate its mechanisms of action.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), a primary 
cause of mortality in patients with RA, has limited treatment options. A 
previously established RA model in D1CC transgenic mice aberrantly expressed 
major histocompatibility complex class II genes in joints, developing collagen 
II-induced polyarthritis and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and 
interstitial pneumonitis, similar to those in humans. Molecular hydrogen (H2 ) 
is an efficient antioxidant that permeates cell membranes and alleviates the 
reactive oxygen species-induced injury implicated in RA pathogenesis. We used 
D1CC mice to analyse chronic lung fibrosis development and evaluate H2 treatment 
effects. We injected D1CC mice with type II collagen and supplied them with H2 
-rich or control water until analysis. Increased serum surfactant protein D 
values and lung densities images were observed 10 months after injection. 
Inflammation was patchy within the perilymphatic stromal area, with increased 
8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cell numbers and tumour necrosis factor-α, 
BAX, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-6 and soluble collagen levels in 
the lungs. Inflammatory and fibrotic changes developed diffusely within the 
perilymphatic stromal area, as observed in humans. H2 treatment decreased these 
effects in the lungs. Thus, this model is valuable for studying the effects of 
H2 treatment and chronic interstitial pneumonia pathophysiology in humans. H2 
appears to protect against RA-ILD by alleviating oxidative stress.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systematic, inflammatory, autoimmune 
disease, associated with a high number of disabilities. Increasing evidence has 
demonstrated that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a 
significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of RA. In this study, we 
have aimed to investigate the effects of polydatin (PD) on NET formation and its 
effects on disease activity in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model.
METHODS: In the presence of PD or vehicle, neutrophils isolated from RA patients 
and mice were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 4 h, and 
NET formation investigated. For in vivo experiments, PD was administered 
intraperitoneally (45 mg/kg per day) to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. 
The incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis were assessed and NET 
deposition tested.
RESULTS: In vitro, PD significantly suppressed NET formation of neutrophils from 
RA patients. Consistently, decreased NETs were observed in PD treated bone 
marrow-derived neutrophils. In CIA mouse model, PD treatment delayed the onset 
of arthritis and attenuated arthritis severity. Compared with vehicle-treated 
CIA mice, the deposition of NETs in ankle joints was also reduced in PD-treated 
CIA mice.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that PD treatment markedly inhibited NET 
formation and protected CIA mice from the development of arthritis. These 
findings suggest that inhibition of NET formation by PD may serve as a novel 
mechanism for the treatment of RA.

Interleukin (IL)‑1β serves a crucial role in the progression of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Previous studies have indicated that the ERK/STAT1 signaling pathway 
may be involved in the inflammatory response in synovial fluid‑derived 
fibroblast‑like synoviocytes (sfd‑FLSs). However, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the pathological effects of the inflammatory factors induced by IL‑1β 
in sfd‑FLSs remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
IL‑1β‑mediated signaling pathways involved in the expression of inflammatory 
factors in sfd‑FLSs and in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. Reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were 
used to analyze the role of IL‑1β in the rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. The 
results suggested that IL‑1β administration exacerbated rheumatoid arthritis, 
bone injury and increased the expression levels of inflammatory factors, such as 
IL‑17 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α), whereas treatment with anti‑IL‑1β 
exhibited opposite effects. In vitro experiments in sfd‑FLSs further suggested 
that treatment with IL‑1β influenced the expression levels of various 
inflammatory factors. In specific, IL‑1β increased the expression of IL‑17 and 
TNF‑α, and decreased the expression of IL‑6 and IL‑10 in sfd‑FLSs. Additionally, 
treatment with IL‑1β increased the mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation 
of NF‑κB, ERK and STAT1 in sfd‑FLSs. Treatment with anti‑IL‑1β exhibited 
opposite effects on the expression levels of inflammatory factors and suppressed 
the NF‑κB‑mediated ERK‑STAT1 signaling pathway activation in sfd‑FLSs. Finally, 
treatment with a NF‑κB inhibitor suppressed the effects of IL‑1β, and NF‑κB 
overexpression reversed the effects of anti‑IL‑1β on the expression levels of 
IL‑17, TNF‑α, NF‑κB, ERK and STAT1. In conclusion, the present results 
demonstrated that treatment with IL‑1β increased the expression levels of 
inflammatory factors in sfd‑FLSs via the regulation of the NF‑κB‑mediated 
ERK/STAT1 signaling pathway in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, 
the NF‑κB/ERK/STAT1 signaling pathway may represent a potential target for the 
development of novel treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.

CEMIP (for "Cell migration-inducing protein" also called KIAA1199 and Hybid for 
"Hyaluronan-binding protein") expression is increased in cancers and described 
as a regulator of cell survival, growth and invasion. In rheumatoid arthritis, 
CEMIP is referred to as an angiogenic marker and participates in hyaluronic acid 
degradation. In this study, CEMIP expression is investigated in healthy and 
osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage from human and mouse. Its role in OA 
physiopathology is deciphered, specifically in chondrocytes proliferation and 
dedifferentiation and in the extracellular matrix remodeling. To this end, 
CEMIP, αSMA and types I and III collagen expressions were assessed in human OA 
and non-OA cartilage. CEMIP expression was also investigated in a mouse OA 
model. CEMIP expression was studied in vitro using a chondrocyte 
dedifferentiation model. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed on 
chondrocytes after CEMIP silencing. Results showed that CEMIP was overexpressed 
in human and murine OA cartilage and along chondrocytes dedifferentiation. Most 
of genes deregulated in CEMIP-depleted cells were involved in cartilage turnover 
(e.g., collagens), mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. CEMIP regulated 
β-catenin protein level. Moreover, CEMIP was essential for chondrocytes 
proliferation and promoted αSMA expression, a fibrosis marker, and TGFβ 
signaling towards the p-Smad2/3 (Alk5/PAI-1) pathway. Interestingly, CEMIP was 
induced by the pSmad1/5 (Alk1) pathway. αSMA and type III collagen expressions 
were overexpressed in human OA cartilage and along chondrocytes 
dedifferentiation. Finally, CEMIP was co-expressed in situ with αSMA in all OA 
cartilage layers. In conclusion, CEMIP was sharply overexpressed in human and 
mouse OA cartilage and along chondrocytes dedifferentiation. CEMIP-regulated 
transdifferentiation of chondrocytes into "chondro-myo-fibroblasts" expressing 
α-SMA and type III collagen, two fibrosis markers. Moreover, these 
"chondro-myo-fibroblasts" were found in OA cartilage but not in healthy 
cartilage.

The recent demonstration that DNA from several mucosal bacteria, including 
Prevotella spp, could be found in numerous tissues (mesenteric lymph nodes, 
spleen, serum, liver, lung, eye and ankle joints), either in HLA-B27 rats with 
or without arthritis, or control rats without HLA-B27, could be a revolution in 
our understanding of spondyloarthritis and close disorders, including rheumatoid 
arthritis. Indeed, similar translocations of dead or alive bacteria or fungi 
from mucosa to joints, could contribute to the onset and flares of inflammatory 
rheumatisms. This state of the art article addresses six questions revived by 
this finding: 1-How does this bacterial DNA or living bacteria traffic from 
mucosa to joints? 2-Can some mucosal bacteria remain alive in those tissues, 
including joints? 3-Could bacteria from the gut microbiota ('self-bacteria') 
protect the host cells from invasion by more pathogenic bacteria (like 
dog-shepherds protect from wolves)? 4-Does the composition of the joint or bone 
marrow microbiota depends on local metabolism, which might differ from gut 
metabolism? 5-Could bacterial antigens from mucosal microbiota be sufficient to 
trigger trained immunity of presenting cells in joints, or does such phenomenon 
(with lasting epigenetic changes of presenting cells) require intra-cellular 
infection of presenting cells or their ancestors? 6-In which subsets of cells 
could living bacteria preferentially persist for a long period in the joint 
area? Transient or dormant infections within bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
leading to trained immunity of some of their daughter cells in joints or 
enthesis, lasting after clearance or the invader, is an attractive hypothesis to 
test.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, progressive autoimmune 
disease. The vascular permeability of inflamed joints in RA makes it a natural 
candidate for passive targeting, similar to the enhanced permeability and 
retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors. Thus, various therapeutic drugs have 
been encapsulated in nanocarriers to achieve longer in vivo circulation times 
and improve RA targeting. Although liposomes are the most widely used 
nanocarriers for RA treatment, the effects of physical and chemical 
characteristics of liposomes, such as particle sizes, surface charge, 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain length, and PEG concentration, on their passive 
RA targeting effect have not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically 
investigated the effects of physical and chemical properties of liposomes on 
circulation time and conducted preliminary studies on their passive targeting 
mechanisms. A series of liposomes with different particle sizes (70, 100, 200, 
and 350 nm), surface charges (positive, negative, slight positive, and slight 
negative), PEG chain lengths (1, 2, and 5 kDa), and concentrations (5, 10, and 
20% w/w of total lipid) were prepared by lipid film dispersion and extrusion. 
The pharmacokinetics of liposomes with different formulas were evaluated with a 
fluorescence microplate reader. A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model 
was utilized to mimic RA pathological conditions and to evaluate the targeting 
and efficacy of liposomes with different properties using a near-infrared 
fluorescence imaging system. Uptake of fluorescent liposomes by various synovial 
cells was measured by flow cytometry. The results indicated that liposomes with 
100 nm diameter, a slight negative charge, and 10% incorporation of 5 kDa PEG 
had better in vivo circulation time and inflamed joint targeting than did other 
liposomes. Dexamethasone (Dex) was encapsulated into optimized liposomes as an 
active ingredient for RA treatment. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that 
Dex liposomes could significantly improve the antiarthritic efficacy of Dex in a 
CIA mouse model of RA. This study also found that the retention mechanism of RA 
was mainly increased because of the uptake of liposomes by fibroblasts and 
macrophages in inflamed joints. This study provides a persuasive explanation for 
passive RA targeting by liposomes and advances our ability to treat RA with 
nanomedicine.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Microbial superantigens have been reported in the 
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients, raising the question 
of whether the presence of these superantigens could provoke the induction of 
inflammatory biomarkers expression or not. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the Staphylococcus aureus superantigen C on CD18 expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The superantigen C was purified by ultrafiltration. 
Immunoblotting was performed using a specific antibody. Also, 50 micrograms of 
superantigens (toxin) were injected intraperitoneally and intra-articularly into 
separate rat groups. Blood was collected and RNA extracted. Then, the cDNA was 
synthesized. The expression of CD18 marker was evaluated using RT-real-time PCR, 
and the results were descriptively analyzed.
RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that 50 μg of toxin, injected 
intra-articularly and intraperitoneally, showed the surplus expression of the 
marker CD18 in the blood of rats after 20 days. By this method, the expression 
of the marker CD18 was significantly different between rats that received the 
superantigen intra-articularly and intraperitoneally (2.10; 2.3 and 3.3 folds) 
and the controls (P≤ 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the presence of Staphylococcal of 
superantigen C in the body of rats has enhanced the expression of the CD18 
inflammatory marker more than 3 times. This valuable finding is an introduction 
to further research and could provide new methods to prevent and control 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune inflammatory disease, 
is rapidly increasing in aging societies. In the current study, celecoxib (CXB) 
micelles were developed to improve the oral absorption and anti-inflammatory 
effects of CXB in cell studies and λ-carrageenan rat models, and to enhance the 
therapeutic effects of CXB on RA in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced RA 
rat models. Moreover, CXB micelles and previously developed solid dispersion 
(SD6) formulations were evaluated. The physical properties of optimal CXB 
micelles (M3), such as crystallinity, thermal properties, and intramolecular 
interactions, were altered. Compared with the commercial product (Celebrex®), 
the M3 and SD6 formulations showed significantly improved anti-inflammatory 
effects in terms of nitric oxide reduction, 1.5-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively, 
at the cellular level. The relative bioavailability (BA) of the M3 and SD6 
formulations was also significantly improved as oral bioavailability (167.2% and 
219.8% respectively), compared with that of Celebrex®. In particular, M3 and SD6 
significantly reduced inflammation and edema volume relative to Celebrex® in 
CFA-induced RA rat models. Moreover, both M3 and SD6 effectively suppressed 
CFA-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) in rat splenic tissues. 
In conclusion, polymeric systems improved the solubility, relative BA (%) and 
anti-inflammatory effects of CXB. Thus, CXB polymeric systems show potential as 
therapeutic agents against inflammation and RA and may need to be tested at the 
clinical level.

Cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) released from either dead or damaged 
cells serves as a key autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They can be 
recognized by nucleic acid (NA) sensors such as the toll-like receptor (TLR), 
leading to activation of the innate immune system and chronic inflammation. 
Developed here is a cationic molecular scavenger, by screening cationic 
dendronized polymers, which eliminates cfDNA and inhibits TLR recognition and 
nucleic-acid-induced inflammation. The structure-property study demonstrates 
that toxicity, NA binding capacity, and biodistribution could be balanced to 
achieve maximum therapeutic effect by exquisite control of the molecular 
structure. In addition, the optimized cationic polymer effectively inhibited 
joint swelling, synovial hyperplasia, and bone destruction in collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) rat models. The results offer support for synthetic polymers 
offering new paradigm in autoimmune disease treatment.

This work aims to improve the antiarthritic activity of (-)-epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG) and glucosamine (GA) through fabrication and optimization of 
casein protein nanoparticles (EGC-NPs). Optimized EGC-NPs were obtained with a 
EGCG/GA/casein ratio of 1:2:8 (w/w/w). The EGC-NPs gave a mean size of 186 ± 3.5 
nm and an entrapment efficiency of 86.8 ± 2.7%, and they exhibited a greater 
inhibitory activity against human fibroblast-like synoviocytes-osteoarthritis 
cells and human fibroblast-like synoviocytes-rheumatoid arthritis cells compared 
with that of the EGCG-GA mixture by 33.5% and 20.8%, respectively. Freeze-dried 
EGC-NPs stored at 25 °C during 12 months showed high dispersion stability. 
Moreover, the redispersion of the freeze-dried EGC-NPs produced almost no 
significant changes in their physicochemical properties and bioactivity. Rat 
experiments demonstrated that the antiarthritis effect of the EGC-NPs was 
significantly higher than that of EGCG-GA mixture, as assessed through an 
analysis of anti-inflammatory efficacy, radiographic images and 
histopathological assessments of paw joints, and immunohistochemical changes in 
serum cytokines. The enchanced antiarthritic activity in vivo was consistent 
with that in vitro. The EGC-NPs demonstrate potential as a food supplement for 
the treatment of arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR, 
is an immunosuppressant used to treat renal transplant recipients, but it can 
cause endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction. Metformin is used for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes and was reported to exert therapeutic effects 
against rheumatoid arthritis and obesity by improving mitochondrial dysfunction 
via the activation of fibroblast growth factor 21. We investigated the 
therapeutic effects of rapamycin-metformin combination therapy in obese mice 
with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with rapamycin, metformin, or 
rapamycin-metformin, and their respiratory level and mitochondrial gene 
expression were assayed. Mice were fed a high-fat diet, immunized with type II 
collagen, and subsequently treated with rapamycin-metformin daily for 10 weeks.
RESULTS: Rapamycin-treated cells exhibited dysfunction of mitochondrial 
respiration and decreased mitochondrial gene expression compared with 
rapamycin-metformin-treated cells. Moreover, rapamycin-metformin reduced the 
clinical arthritis score and the extent of histological inflammation and 
improved the metabolic profile in obese mice with CIA. Rapamycin-metformin 
enhanced the balance between T helper 17 and regulatory T cells in vitro and in 
vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rapamycin-metformin is a potential 
therapeutic option for autoimmune arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Unbiased studies using different genome-wide methods have identified 
several novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (RA). However, clinical translation has proven difficult. Here, we 
hypothesized that one reason could be that inflammatory responses in peripheral 
blood are different from those in the arthritic joint.
METHODS: We performed meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data from 
synovium, whole blood cells (WBC), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 
and CD4+ T cells from patients with RA and healthy controls in order to identify 
overlapping pathways, upstream regulators and potential biomarkers. We also 
analyzed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral blood and 
whole joints from a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis.
RESULTS: Analyses of two profiling data sets from synovium from RA patients and 
healthy controls all showed significant activation of pathways with known 
pathogenic relevance, such as the Th1 pathway, the role of NFAT in regulation of 
the immune response, dendritic cell maturation, iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper 
cells, Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon signaling, Cdc42 
signaling, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis. The most activated 
upstream regulators included TNF, an important drug target, as well as IFN-gamma 
and CD40LG, all of which are known to play important pathogenic roles in RA. The 
differentially expressed genes from synovium included several potential 
biomarkers, such as CCL5, CCL13, CCL18, CX3CL1, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, 
IL15, IL32, IL1RN, SPP1, and TNFSF11. By contrast, microarray studies of WBC, 
PBMC and CD4+ T cells showed variable pathways and limited pathway overlap with 
synovium. Similarly, scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis did not 
support that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood reflect those in the 
arthritic joints. These data showed pathway overlap between mouse joint cells 
and synovium from patients with RA, but not with cells in peripheral blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a dichotomy between gene expression changes, 
pathways, upstream regulators and biomarkers in synovium and cell types in 
peripheral blood, which complicates identification of biomarkers in blood.

Street, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.

Nano-medicine can passively accumulate in chronic inflammatory tissues via the 
enhanced permeability and retention phenomenon, or by being conjugated with a 
ligand that can bind to receptors over expressed by cells inside chronic 
inflammatory tissues, contributing to reduced systemic side-effects and 
increased efficacy. This article highlights the utilization of nanomedicine for 
potential treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis was induced in 
rat model via 2 weeks intradermal injection of pristane at the base of the tail 
in a daily dose of 150 μl. Susceptible rat strains developed severe arthritis 
with a sudden onset 3 weeks post pristane injection. Three weeks post pristane 
administration; rats were treated intravenously with glutathione or 
liposomal-glutathione in a dose of 5 mg/kg daily for 30 days. Concomitant 
supplementation with the aforementioned antioxidants effect on proinflammatory 
marker C-reactive protein (CRP) was assessed. On the other hand, oxidative 
stress biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) compared with 
pristane treated group was also investigated. The results elucidated that 
glutathione and liposomal -glutathione significantly reduced rheumatoid factor, 
malondialdehyde and C-reactive protein levels with the superiority of liposomal 
-glutathione in this side reflecting its pronounced effect as anti-rheumatoid 
agent.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zishen Tongluo formula (ZTF) is simplified from 
the Qingluo Tongbi formula, which has been applied to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in clinical practices for several decades. Our previous studies have 
verified the effects of ZTF on arthritis animal models. However, its mechanism 
of treating RA is not clear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of 
ZTF on the Th17/Treg balance in RA mice and the role of the different herb 
groups with the effect of Zishen yangyin (YY), Huatan quyu (HT), or Qufeng 
chushi (QF) in ZTF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was 
established. The animals were randomly divided into the normal, model, positive 
drug, YY, QF, HT, and the whole compound (ZTF) groups. After oral administration 
for one-month, cytokine levels in the plasma and histopathological changes of 
the joint were measured by ELISA and hematoxylin-eosin staining, respectively. 
Meanwhile, the balance of Th17/Treg cells in blood, spleen or lymph nodes was 
detected using flow cytometry and qPCR.
RESULTS: ZTF or the different functional groups could improve the joint 
inflammation, decrease the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, restore the 
balance of Th17 and Treg cells in CIA mice. However, there were some differences 
in each functional group: YY mainly promoted the responses of Treg cells while 
QF inhibited the functions of Th17 cells. Besides, HT regulated both Th17 and 
Treg cells to keep the immune balance.
CONCLUSIONS: ZTF could notably ameliorate CIA mice by restoring the balance of 
Th17/Treg cells. Each functional group could target Th17 and/or Treg cells to 
produce synergistic/enhancement effects, and ZTF had a better holistic effect in 
RA treatment.

Morinda citrifolia L., known as noni, originated from Indonesia exhibits various 
pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory properties. However, the 
validity of noni fruit juice as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an 
autoimmune disorder, has not been confirmed yet. Therefore, the main purpose of 
this research was to evaluate the efficacy of noni fruit juice (INFJ) made in 
Indonesia using SKG mice as an animal model of RA, which shows the resembling 
characteristics of human RA patients. Furthermore, the safety of INFJ was 
examined by repeated dose experiments in mice. INFJ was mixed with water at 50% 
and administered to SKG mice sensitized with mannan, free access for 4 weeks. 
Arthritis scores of fore- and hind-leg joints were measured and the joints were 
histopathologically examined. The sub-acute and sub-chronic toxicities of INFJ 
were evaluated using BALB/c mice. The arthritic scores were significantly lower 
from the 7 d after sensitization in the INFJ group than the control group. 
Histopathological examinations of the joints revealed inhibition of severity of 
RA. In both toxicity studies, INFJ did not show any toxicities. INFJ exhibited 
anti-arthritic activity in arthritic and histopathological examinations of the 
joints in SKG mice. Present study was the first report where noni juice may be 
effective against RA. The dose of noni juice showing efficacy against RA was 
confirmed safe from repeated dose studies in mice.

Protein citrullination (or deimination), an irreversible post-translational 
modification, has been implicated in several physiological and pathological 
processes, including gene expression regulation, apoptosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. Several research studies have been carried 
out on citrullination under many conditions. However, until now, challenges in 
sample preparation and data analysis have made it difficult to confidently 
identify a citrullinated protein and assign the citrullinated site. To overcome 
these limitations, we generated a mouse hyper-citrullinated spectral library and 
set up coordinates to confidently identify and validate citrullinated sites. 
Using this workflow, we detect a four-fold increase in citrullinated proteome 
coverage across six mouse organs compared with the current state-of-the art 
techniques. Our data reveal that the subcellular distribution of citrullinated 
proteins is tissue-type-dependent and that citrullinated targets are involved in 
fundamental physiological processes, including the metabolic process. These data 
represent the first report of a hyper-citrullinated library for the mouse and 
serve as a central resource for exploring the role of citrullination in this 
organism.

Nitric oxide (NO), a radical gas molecule produced by nitric oxide synthase, 
plays a key role in the human body. However, when endogenous NO is overproduced 
by physiological disorders, severe inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) can occur. Therefore, scavenging NO may be an alternative 
strategy for treating inflammatory disorders. In our previous study, we 
developed a NO-responsive macrosized hydrogel by incorporating a NO-cleavable 
cross-linker (NOCCL); here, we further evaluate the effectiveness of the 
NO-scavenging nanosized hydrogel (NO-Scv gel) for treating RA. NO-Scv gel is 
simply prepared by solution polymerization between acrylamide and NOCCL. When 
the NO-Scv gel is exposed to NO, NOCCL is readily cleaved by consuming the NO 
molecule, as demonstrated in a Griess assay. As expected, the NO-Scv gel reduces 
inflammation levels by scavenging NO in vitro and shows excellent 
biocompatibility. Furthermore, the more promising therapeutic effect of the 
NO-Scv gel in suppressing the onset of RA is observed in vivo in a mouse RA 
model when compared to the effects of dexamethasone, a commercial drug. 
Therefore, our findings suggest the potential of the NO-Scv gel for biomedical 
applications and further clinical translation.

IgG antibodies cause inflammation and organ damage in autoimmune diseases such 
as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated the metabolic profile of 
macrophages isolated from inflamed tissues in immune complex (IC)-associated 
diseases, including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and following IgG Fcγ receptor 
cross-linking. We found that human and mouse macrophages undergo a switch to 
glycolysis in response to IgG IC stimulation, mirroring macrophage metabolic 
changes in inflamed tissue in vivo. This metabolic reprogramming was required to 
generate a number of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, and was 
dependent on mTOR and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1α. Inhibition of 
glycolysis, or genetic depletion of HIF1α, attenuated IgG IC-induced activation 
of macrophages in vitro, including primary human kidney macrophages. In vivo, 
glycolysis inhibition led to a reduction in kidney macrophage IL-1β and reduced 
neutrophil recruitment in a murine model of antibody-mediated nephritis. 
Together, our data reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning FcγR-mediated 
metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and suggest a therapeutic strategy for 
autoantibody-induced inflammation, including lupus nephritis.

Objective: The long-distance migration of rheumatoid arthritis synovial 
fibroblasts (RASFs) in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suggests that an interaction between RASFs and 
endothelial cells (EC) is critical in this process. Our objective was to assess 
whether immunomodulatory factors such as adipokines and antirheumatic drugs 
affect the adhesion of RASFs to ECs or the expression of surface molecules. 
Methods: Primary ECs or human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and 
primary RASFs were stimulated with adiponectin (10 μg/mL), visfatin (100 ng/mL), 
and resistin (20 ng/mL) or treated with methotrexate (1.5 and 1,000 μM) and the 
glucocorticoids prednisolone (1 μM) and dexamethasone (1 μM), respectively. The 
expression of adhesion molecules was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. The interaction of both cell types was analyzed under static 
(cell-to-cell binding assay) and dynamic conditions (flow-adhesion assay). 
Results: Under static conditions, adipokines increased mostly binding of RASFs 
to EC (adiponectin: 40%, visfatin: 28%, tumor necrosis factor α: 49%). Under 
flow conditions, visfatin increased RASF adhesion to HUVEC (e.g., 0.5 dyn/cm2: 
75.2%). Reduced adhesion of RASFs to E-selectin was observed after treatment 
with dexamethasone (e.g., 0.9 dyn/cm2: -40%). In ECs, tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α) increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (20-fold) and 
vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (77-fold), whereas P-selectin was 
downregulated after stimulation with TNF-α (-6-fold). Conclusion: The adhesion 
of RASFs to EC was increased by visfatin under static and flow conditions, 
whereas glucocorticoids were able to decrease adhesion to E-selectin. The 
process of migration and adhesion of RASFs to ECs could be enhanced by 
adipokines via adhesion molecules and seems to be targeted by therapeutic 
intervention with glucocorticoids.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is defined as a chronic autoimmune inflammatory 
disorder that causes damage to limb joints and progressive injuries to secondary 
organs. Medical practitioners prescribe Methotrexate (MTX) as standard care 
medicine for treating RA. However, the long-term application of MTX has shown to 
have adverse health-related effects. Divya Amvatari Ras (DAR), an Indian 
Ayurvedic herbo-mineral formulation, has been described in ancient texts to 
provide relief from RA inflammation associated distress. Therefore, in the 
present study, we explored the biocompatibility, anti-inflammatory, and 
anti-arthritic efficacy of DAR using in vivo and in vitro disease models. Using 
carrageenan (CA)-stimulated Wistar rat paw edema model, we showed a reduction in 
inflammation-induced paw edema at human equivalent dose of DAR. Anti-rheumatic 
efficacy of DAR was studied using collagen-antibody cocktail (C-Ab) Induced 
Arthritis (CAIA) mouse model. The onset of RA in the CAIA mice was determined 
using parameters such as the increase in arthritis score, and induction of 
disease associated lesions in the ankle and knee joints, and increase in 
mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Treatment of CAIA animals with a human 
equivalent dose of DAR significantly reversed the RA-associated pathogenesis. 
These effects were comparable with the standard of care RA drug, MTX. DAR acted 
at multiple levels of inflammation associated with RA to reduce progressive 
pathogenesis. Animal serum biochemistry showed DAR was capable of ameliorating 
RA induced increase in liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). In the lipopolysaccharide 
stimulated THP-1 cells, DAR was found to inhibit the release of IL-6, IL-1β, 
TNF-α, and upstream inflammatory gene regulatory protein, NFκB. The study 
endorsed the anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory activity of the Indian 
Traditional herbo-mineral medicine, DAR. These results also confirm that DAR was 
highly biocompatible and would show minimal health-related side effects than 
those associated with standard of care MTX. Taken together, we show that the DAR 
could be utilized as a promising alternative or complementary therapy for 
treating rheumatoid arthritis.

Anoectochilus roxburghii, a famous Chinese herbal medicine, has been commonly 
used for the treatment of liver disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. Our 
study aimed to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects of A. 
roxburghii polysaccharides (ARP), using the rat's model of type II 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). ARP was prepared by alcohol sedimentation and 
structurally characterized based on combined chemical, chromatographic and 
spectroscopic methods. High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle 
Laser Light Scattering-Refrative Index (HPSEC-MALLS-RI) analysis revealed that 
ARP includes two peaks, and the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the 
principal one was estimated as 5.90 kDa with a relative content of 98.2%. 
Pharmacological results exhibited that ARP significantly decreased the arthritis 
index and ameliorated the inflammatory cell infiltration and the synovial tissue 
destruction in CIA rats. Additionally, ARP possessed significant NO production 
inhibitory effects and antioxidant activity. Further anti-inflammatory mechanism 
investigations indicated that ARP significantly inhibited the activation of 
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of IκB and 
p65, which subsequently down-regulated the mRNA expressions of IL-1β and IL-6 in 
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. These findings suggested that ARP has great 
potential in the development of functional foods and dietary supplements for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic inflammatory 
disease characterized by upregulation of inflammatory cell death and 
osteoclastogenesis. Necrostatin (NST)-1s is a chemical inhibitor of 
receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK)1, which plays a role 
in necroptosis.
METHODS: We investigated whether NST-1s decreases inflammatory cell death and 
inflammatory responses in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
RESULTS: NST-1s decreased the progression of CIA and the synovial expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, NST-1s treatment decreased the expression 
of necroptosis mediators such as RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase 
domain-like (MLKL). In addition, NST-1s decreased osteoclastogenesis in vitro 
and in vivo. NST-1s downregulated T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell expression, but 
promoted Th2 and regulatory T (Treg) cell expression in CIA mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NST-1s attenuates CIA progression via 
the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and might be a potential therapeutic agent 
for RA therapy.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease causing 
destruction of bone and cartilago articularis. Traditional treatment methods 
have many side effects, or too concerne about the anti-inflammatory mechanisms 
but ignore osteanagenesis. In this work, a novel therapeutic platform combined 
black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNs) into platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-chitosan 
thermoresponsive hydrogel has been prepared for management of RA. The BPNs 
generate local heat upon near-infrared irradiation, and delivering reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) to the inﬂamed joints simultaneously for removing 
hyperplastic synovial tissue. The injectable chitosan thermoresponsive hydrogel 
can take control of the releasing of BPNs degradation products, which provide 
ample raw materials for osteanagenesis. In addition, the PRP can effectively 
improve the adhesion and increase capacity of mesenchymal stem cells on chitosan 
thermosensitive hydrogels. And this thermoresponsive hydrogel can protect 
articular cartilage by reducing the friction on the surrounding tissue. Drug 
delayed release property was indicated by the release and uptake of 
methotrexate. The edema degree of the arthritic mouse was reduced obviously by 
the BPNs/Chitosan/PRP thermoresponsive hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo 
studies suggest that the thermoresponsive hydrogel can provide a potential 
possibility for the management of RA.

OBJECTIVES: Although articular cartilage contributes to smooth joint motion, 
once damaged this functionality cannot be recovered. Activation of the 
IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway contributes to chondrogenic differentiation of 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), indicating a role for soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) 
during chondrogenesis in vitro. The aim of this study is to develop a novel 
therapeutic tool for regenerative medicine of articular cartilage.
METHODS: Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were pre-treated with sIL-6R to direct 
their differentiation into chondrocytes, then seeded on a 
poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) sheet to enhance the localised residence of 
MSCs. The material was implanted into knee joint spaces of antigen-induced 
arthritis (AIA) rats, an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After 8 
weeks, the effects of the implantation on articular cartilage repair were 
assessed by x-ray image and staining with safranin O (S-O), aggrecan and human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA).
RESULTS: Swelling of knees in AIA rats, but not sham-treated rats, was observed. 
AIA rats implanted with PLGA and sIL-6R-treated MSCs showed similar knee joint 
imaging to sham rats using x-ray; however, those with PLGA alone, or with PLGA 
with MSCs, did not. Rats implanted with PLGA and sIL-6R-treated MSCs, but not 
PLGA alone or PLGA with MSCs, showed positive imaging by S-O staining as well as 
human aggrecan. HLA was not detected in the knees of any of the rats.
CONCLUSIONS: PLGA and sIL-6R-treated MSCs help to repair articular cartilage 
with high efficacy. Thus, the application of this promising strategy to 
regenerative medicine for articular cartilage in patients with RA is 
anticipated.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether free (3-PD-5free) and/or liposomal (3-PD-5lipo) 
6,7-dihydroxy-3-[3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl]-coumarin (3-PD-5) (1) modulate the 
effector functions of neutrophils from patients with rheumatoid arthritis under 
remission (i-RA) and with active disease (a-RA), in vitro; and (2) exert 
anti-inflammatory effect in a rat model of zymosan-induced acute joint 
inflammation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Incorporation of 3-PD-5 into unilamellar liposomes of soya 
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol was efficient (57.5 ± 7.9%) and yielded 
vesicles with low diameter (133.7 ± 18.4 nm), polydispersity index 
(0.39 ± 0.06), and zeta potential (- 1.22 ± 0.34 mV). 3-PD-5free (1 µM) and 
3-PD-5lipo (3 µM) equally suppressed elastase release and reactive oxygen 
species generation in neutrophils from healthy subjects and i-RA and a-RA 
patients, stimulated with immune complexes. 3-PD-5free (20 µM) suppressed the 
release of neutrophil extracellular traps and chemotaxis in vitro, without clear 
signs of cytotoxicity. 3-PD-5lipo (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) diminished joint edema and 
synovial infiltration of total leukocytes and neutrophils, without changing the 
synovial levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, the results reported herein indicate that 3-PD-5 is a 
promising modulator of the early stages of acute joint inflammation that can 
help to diminish not only excessive neutrophil infiltration in the synovia but 
also neutrophil activation and its outcomes in RA patients.

Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a key member of the TGF-β superfamily, 
plays critical roles in various medical conditions. Recently, GDF11 was found to 
suppress the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
(NF-κB) signaling pathway and protect against inflammation. This study aimed to 
investigate the role of GDF11 in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
We demonstrated that GDF11 treatment antagonized TNF-α-induced inflammation in 
macrophages. Moreover, GDF11 inhibited the development of arthritis in the 
collagen-induced arthritis and collagen antibody-induced arthritis models. Local 
gene transfer of GDF11 via adeno-associated virus exerted therapeutic effects, 
while local knockdown of GDF11 exaggerated inflammation in our collagen-induced 
arthritis model, as detected by expression levels of inflammatory biomarkers and 
the destruction of joint structures. Additionally, the results from both in 
vitro experiments and luciferase reporter gene mouse experiments implied that 
the NF-κB pathway might play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of GDF11 
in RA. This study presents GDF11 as a potential target for the treatment of 
inflammatory arthritis, including RA.-Li, W., Wang, W., Liu, L., Qu, R., Chen,

This study is directed towards the gentle transdermal delivery of Neurotoxin 
(NT) and study of the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in rats by NT 
loaded dissolving Microneedles (DMNs-NT). The DMNs-NT fabrication involved a 
two-step centrifugation method. The quadrangular pyramid shape needles had great 
mechanical strength. The upper part of the needle contained 15.4 ± 0.5 μg of 
drug per patch. Blank DMNs showed favorable biocompatibility and low toxicity on 
the chondrocyte cells. Both NT and DMNs-NT displayed anti-inflammatory 
capabilities ex-vitro. The results of ex-vitro evaluation of DMNs the skin 
penetration depth of DMNs-NT rats was higher than 70 μm and the cumulative 
penetration of NT in DMNs could reach 95.8% in 4 h, whereas, the NT solution 
could barely penetrate the skin, thereby proving the favorable facilitation of 
NT transdermal delivery. The needle structure dissolved completely after 10 min 
in vivo and the channel on the Stratum Corneum (SC) was closed after 6 h. There 
was no significant adverse reaction on the skin after 15 days of administration. 
The pharmacodynamic study showed that DMNs-NT significantly reduced the toe 
swelling of RA rats and reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum to 
alleviate the injury of the ankle joints. DMNs-NT held favorable stability in 
3 months. All these results established that DMNs-NT could penetrate the skin of 
rats in a biocompatible manner, and have a strong therapeutic effect on rat RA 
by transdermal delivery.

Background Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at twice the risk of 
ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death as the general population. We 
hypothesize that β-blocker treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is antiarrhythmic 
by producing synergistic anticatecholaminergic and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Methods and Results Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in Lewis rats 
by immunization with type II collagen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The 
treatment with propranolol (4 mg/kg) started on the first day of immunization. 
We evaluated the ventricular vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using in 
vivo programmed stimulation and performed ex vivo optical mapping to measure the 
electrical remodeling of the heart. The ventricular tissue was further processed 
for immunohistochemical staining and protein array analysis. The assessment of 
ventricular vulnerability showed that the number and duration of the induced 
ventricular arrhythmia episodes were increased in CIA rats, which were improved 
with propranolol treatment. The sympathovagal index and the plasma level of 
catecholamines significantly increased in CIA rats, whereas the use of 
propranolol attenuated sympathetic hyperactivity. In the optical mapping study, 
electrical remodeling, characterized by prolonged action potential duration, 
slow conduction velocity, and steepened action-potential duration restitution, 
were noted in CIA rats and reversed in the propranolol-treatment group. The 
propranolol treatment was associated with decreases in paw thickness, fewer 
inflammatory cell infiltrations in the heart, reduced levels of cardiac 
inflammatory cytokines, and less cardiac fibrosis as compared with the CIA 
group. Conclusions CIA increased ventricular arrhythmia vulnerability through 
sympathetic hyperinnervation and proarrhythmic ventricular electrophysiological 
remodeling. Treatment with propranolol in CIA rats was both anti-inflammatory 
and antiarrhythmic.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) represents a chronic T cell-mediated inflammatory 
autoimmune disease. Studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to 
the pathogenesis of RA. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) represent one important 
group of epigenetic regulators. However, the role of individual HDAC members for 
the pathogenesis of arthritis is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate 
that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of HDAC1 (HDAC1-cKO) are resistant to 
the development of Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), whereas the antibody 
response to collagen type II was undisturbed, indicating an unaltered T 
cell-mediated B cell activation. The inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 were 
significantly decreased in sera of HDAC1-cKO mice. IL-6 treated HDAC1-deficient 
CD4+ T cells showed an impaired upregulation of CCR6. Selective inhibition of 
class I HDACs with the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 under Th17-skewing conditions 
inhibited the upregulation of chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) in mouse and human 
CD4+ T cells. Accordingly, analysis of human RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and 
histological analysis of synovial tissue samples from human RA patients revealed 
the existence of CD4+CCR6+ cells with enhanced HDAC1 expression. Our data 
indicate a key role for HDAC1 for the pathogenesis of CIA and suggest that HDAC1 
and other class I HDACs might be promising targets of selective HDAC inhibitors 
(HDACi) for the treatment of RA.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease closely 
correlated to synovial tissue inflammation. Exosomes are known to transfer 
microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells and have been validated as the vehicles for 
delivery of therapeutic molecules.
AIM AND SCOPE: The current study was set to examine the functional values of 
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-secreted exosomal miR-192-5p 
(exo-miR-192-5p) on inflammation in RA.
METHODS: Following the screening of differentially expressed genes in RA and 
miRNA-mRNA target prediction, BMSCs were infected with lentivirus expressing 
miR-192-5p to obtain miR-192-5p-overexpressed exosomes. To study the effect of 
exo-miR-192-5p on the expression of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 
(RAC2), collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat models were established, and the 
clinical and histopathological changes were evaluated in the rats injected with 
exosomes. Subsequently, the expression patterns of pro-inflammatory factors were 
determined by ELISA.
RESULTS: miR-192-5p was found to be down-regulated, while RAC2 was up-regulated 
in RA samples. Bioinformatics prediction revealed that the up-regulated RAC2 in 
RA may be regulated by miR-192-5p, which was further confirmed by dual 
luciferase reporter gene assay. The clinical arthritic scores, joint 
destruction, and inflammatory response were reduced after the injection of 
exosomes in rats with CIA targeting RAC2, and the treatment efficacy was even 
better with miR-192-5p-overexpressed exosomes.
CONCLUSION: Our study established that the BMSCs-secreted exosomal miR-192-5p 
can delay the event of the inflammatory response in RA and may represent a 
possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, chronic autoimmune disease 
characterized by various inflammatory symptoms, including joint swelling, joint 
pain, and both structural and functional joint damage. The most commonly used 
animal model for studying RA is mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA); the 
wide use of this model is due primarily to many similarities with RA in human 
patients. Metabolomics is used increasingly in biological studies for diagnosing 
disease and for predicting and evaluating drug interventions, as a large number 
of disease-associated metabolites can be analyzed and interpreted from a 
biological perspective.
AIM: To profile free amino acids and their biogenic metabolites in CIA mice 
plasma.
METHOD: Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
coupled with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for metabolomics study.
RESULTS: Profile of 45 amine metabolites, including free amino acids and their 
biogenic metabolites in plasma was obtained from CIA mice. We found that the 
plasma levels of 20 amine metabolites were significantly decreased in the CIA 
group.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a disordered amine response is linked to 
RA-associated muscle wasting and energy expenditure.

Six new ellagitannins, brevipetins B-G (5 and 7-11), and a new phenolic 
glucoside, brevipetin A (4), along with six known compounds were isolated from 
the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Cleidion brevipetiolatum. Their 
structures and absolute configurations were determined by spectroscopic 
analyses, chemical methods, and TD-DFT-ECD calculations. Compounds 5-11 
exhibited NO inhibitory effects with IC50 values of 1.9-8.2 μM, and 9 showed the 
most potent inhibitory effect (IC50: 1.9 μM). An in vivo anti-inflammatory 
assessment of 9 showed that it exerts therapeutic effects in both the 
carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) models at 
50 mg/kg oral administration. The enhanced protein and mRNA expression levels of 
iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in 
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were dose-dependently suppressed by 9. An 
anti-inflammatory mechanistic study revealed that 9 suppressed NF-κB activity by 
inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation and blocking translocation of p65 from the 
cytosol to the nucleus. Therefore, 9 might have the potential to be developed as 
a lead compound for relieving rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that may be 
associated with gut microbiota via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Human 
umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) have therapeutic potential against RA, 
but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this 
study was to explore the mechanism of action of HUMSCs in rats with 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHOD: HUMSCs (1 × 106) were transplanted into each rat with CIA. The tissue 
localization of HUMSCs and the therapeutic effects in the ankles were assessed. 
The immune status and expression of immune-related genes and proteins in related 
lymphoid tissues were subsequently tested. Furthermore, the levels of 
immune-related factors in serum and the changes in gut microbiota in the ileum 
were detected, and the levels of indole and their derivatives in plasma and the 
levels of AhR in the ileum were evaluated.
RESULTS: HUMSCs homed to the popliteal lymph node (PLN), mesenteric lymph node 
(MLN), ankle cartilage, and ileum mucosa in rats with CIA. The transplantation 
of HUMSCs reduced the pathology scores and the degree of bone damage in the 
ankles. The immune status of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and T helper (Th)17 
cells and the gene expression levels of interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-β1, and IL-17A were altered in the PLN, which is the lymph tissue 
closest to the nidus, and the MLN, which is one of the gut-associated lymphoid 
tissues (GALTs). The proportion and function of B cells, Tregs, and Th17 cells 
were regulated in other GALTs, namely, Peyer's patches and the lamina propria. 
The gene expression of TGF-β1 and IL-17A and protein expression of IL-10, 
TGF-β1, IL-17A, IL-22, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were modulated in the ileum, 
and the serum levels of IL-10, TGF-β1, IL-17A, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α were regulated in the rats with CIA. The relative abundances of the 
genera Bacteroides and Bacillus were increased in the HUMSCs-treated rat with 
CIA; in addition, the levels of indole, indoleacetic acid, and indole-3-lactic 
acid were consistently upregulated, and this upregulation was accompanied by 
increases in AhR gene and protein expression.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that HUMSCs play a therapeutic role in rats 
with CIA by regulating the interactions between host immunity and gut microbiota 
via the AhR.

Intestinal immunity and flora are reported to be associated with the onset of 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, differences in the intestinal immunity and flora 
dynamics between the initial peak and relapse of arthritis have not been 
investigated. Here we analyzed the lymphocyte populations in different lymphoid 
tissues, the IgA in feces, and the intestinal flora at the initial peak and the 
relapse phase of arthritis in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. In 
this model compared with the control group, the percentage of RORγt+CD4+ T cells 
in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) was increased at the initial peak but 
decreased at the relapse stage of arthritis, and the opposite changes were 
observed in the spleen. The percentage of Foxp3+CD4+ T cells was unchanged at 
the initial peak in both tissues but increased only in the mLN at the relapse 
stage. The IgA in feces increased with the progression of arthritis, and 
bacterial analysis revealed that some specific bacterial families were changed 
at the peak and relapse stages of arthritis. Finally, the immune dynamics under 
different arthritic conditions were examined by integrating these factors using 
principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed that the immunological and 
intestinal flora profiles were different between the initial peak and the 
relapse of the arthritis. Our findings suggest that the intestinal immunity and 
the environment change drastically with the progress of arthritis.

Mast cells (MCs) are important sensor and effector cells of the immune system 
that are involved in many physiological and pathological conditions. Increasing 
evidence suggests that they also play an important role in bone metabolism and 
bone disorders. MCs are located in the bone marrow and secrete a wide spectrum 
of mediators, which can be rapidly released upon activation of mature MCs 
following their differentiation in mucosal or connective tissues. Many of these 
mediators can exert osteocatabolic effects by promoting osteoclast formation 
[e.g., histamine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and/or by 
inhibiting osteoblast activity (e.g., IL-1, TNF). By contrast, MCs could 
potentially act in an osteoprotective manner by stimulating osteoblasts (e.g., 
transforming growth factor-β) or reducing osteoclastogenesis (e.g., IL-12, 
interferon-γ). Experimental studies investigating MC functions in physiological 
bone turnover using MC-deficient mouse lines give contradictory results, 
reporting delayed or increased bone turnover or no influence depending on the 
mouse model used. By contrast, the involvement of MCs in various pathological 
conditions affecting bone is evident. MCs may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
primary and secondary osteoporosis as well as inflammatory disorders, including 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, because increased numbers of MCs were 
found in patients suffering from these diseases. The clinical observations could 
be largely confirmed in experimental studies using MC-deficient mouse models, 
which also provide mechanistic insights. MCs also regulate bone healing after 
fracture by influencing the inflammatory response toward the fracture, 
vascularization, bone formation, and callus remodeling by osteoclasts. This 
review summarizes the current view and understanding of the role of MCs on bone 
in both physiological and pathological conditions.

BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data regarding angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs) induced anemia and its beneficial anti-inflammatory effect in rheumatoid 
arthritis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 
telmisartan administration either alone or in combination with etanercept on 
anemia of chronic inflammatory diseases in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in 
rats.
METHODS: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was induced by Freund's Complete Adjuvant 
(FCA; 1 mg/0.1 ml paraffin oil), injected subcutaneously on days 0, 30 and 40. 
Rats with RA received dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), etanercept (0.3 mg/kg 3 
times/week; sc), telmisartan (1.5 mg/kg/day; orally) or combination of 
etanercept and telmisartan. Arthritis parameters (footpad circumference change 
and paw volume change), erythrocyte indices (hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume 
and mean corpuscular hemoglobin level changes), iron profile (serum iron and 
serum ferritin), serum levels of erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated, along with measuring 
serum urea and creatinine levels.
RESULTS: All treated groups showed improvement of the measured parameters in 
comparison to RA-control subgroup. Telmisartan either alone or in combination 
with etanercept significantly improved arthritis and erythrocyte indices. 
Telmisartan showed significant increase in EPO and decrease in hepcidin compared 
to etanercept. Combination group showed significant improvement in serum iron, 
ferritin, EPO, hepcidin, TNF-α, IL-6, urea and creatinine, compared to 
etanercept. Telmisartan either alone or in combination, but not etanercept 
alone, significantly decreased creatinine level.
CONCLUSION: Telmisartan improved anemia and arthritis parameters and showed 
anti-inflammatory and reno-protective effects, in a rat model of rheumatoid 
arthritis.

Despite the advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) achieved in 
the last few years, several patients are diagnosed late, do not respond to or 
have to stop therapy because of inefficacy and/or toxicity, leaving still a huge 
unmet need. Tissue-specific strategies have the potential to address some of 
these issues. The aim of the study is the development of a safe nanotechnology 
approach for tissue-specific delivery of drugs and diagnostic probes. 
CD34 + endothelial precursors were addressed in inflamed synovium using targeted 
biodegradable nanoparticles (tBNPs). These nanostructures were made of 
poly-lactic acid, poly-caprolactone, and PEG and then coated with a synovial 
homing peptide. Immunofluorescence analysis clearly demonstrated their capacity 
to selectively address CD34 + endothelial cells in synovial tissue obtained from 
human, mouse, and rat. Biodistribution studies in two different animal models of 
rheumatoid arthritis (antigen-induced arthritis/AIA and collagen-induced 
arthritis/CIA) confirmed the selective accumulation in inflamed joints but also 
evidenced the capacity of tBNP to detect early phases of the disease and the 
preferential liver elimination. The therapeutic effect of methotrexate 
(MTX)-loaded tBNPs were studied in comparison with conventional MTX doses. 
MTX-loaded tBNPs prevented and treated CIA and AIA at a lower dose and reduced 
administration frequency than MTX. Moreover, MTX-loaded tBNP showed a novel 
mechanism of action, in which the particles target and kill CD34 + endothelial 
progenitors, preventing neo-angiogenesis and, consequently, synovial 
inflammation. tBNPs represent a stable and safe platform to develop 
highly-sensitive imaging and therapeutic approaches in RA targeting specifically 
synovial neo-angiogenesis to reduce local inflammation.

This study introduces a novel monoclonal anti-α9 integrin antibody (MA9-413) 
with human variable regions, isolated by phage display technology. MA9-413 
specifically binds to both human and mouse α9 integrin by recognizing a 
conserved loop region designated as L1 (amino acids 104-122 of human α9 
integrin). MA9-413 inhibits human and mouse α9 integrin-dependent cell adhesion 
to ligands and suppresses synovial inflammation and osteoclast activation in a 
mouse model of arthritis. This is the first monoclonal anti-α9 integrin antibody 
that can react with and functionally inhibit both human and mouse α9 integrin. 
MA9-413 allows data acquisition both in animal and human pharmacological studies 
without resorting to surrogate antibodies. Since MA9-413 showed certain 
therapeutic effects in the mouse arthritis model, it can be considered as a 
useful therapy against rheumatoid arthritis and other α9 integrin-associated 
diseases.

Context: Adlay seed [Job's tears, Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf 
(Poaceae)] is a Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has been investigated to 
treat inflammatory diseases and rheumatism.Objective: This study evaluates the 
ameliorative effects of adlay seed extract (ASE) in a complete Freund's adjuvant 
(CFA)-induced rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats.Materials and methods: The RA 
Sprague-Dawley rat model was induced and randomly divided into six groups with 
or without ASE treatment (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg). After 28 d administration, the 
symptoms, biochemical parameters and molecular mechanisms were 
investigated.Results: The values of paw oedema, PGE2 and MMP-3 decreased from 
1.46 ± 0.04 to 0.66 ± 0.07 cm3, from 126.2 ± 11.48 to 79.71 ± 6.8 pg/mL and from 
142.7 ± 8.36 to 86.51 ± 5.95 ng/mL, respectively; the values of body weight 
increased from 177.25 ± 5.94 to 205 ± 6.52 g in HASE group. In addition, 
treatment of ASE reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, 
IL-6, MCP-1), and increased the activities of antioxidant enzyme (GSH-Px, SOD, 
and CAT). Furthermore, ASE could suppress the mRNA expression of COX-2 and 
CHI3L1 and improve the mRNA expression of CAT and GPx-1 in ankle tissues of RA 
rats.Discussion and conclusions: For the first time, our results indicated ASE 
exerts anti-RA effects via inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors and alleviating 
oxidative stress. Our finding sheds light on the research and development of 
anti-RA functional foods from adlay seed.

BACKGROUND: Imbalanced oxidative stress and antioxidant defense are involved in 
airway remodeling in asthma. It has been demonstrated that Tetrandrine has a 
potent role in antioxidant defense in rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension. 
However, the correlation between Tetrandrine and oxidative stress in asthma is 
utterly blurry. This study aimed to investigate the role of Tetrandrine on 
oxidative stress-mediated airway remolding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic asthma was established by ovalbumin (OVA) 
administration in male Wistar rats. Histopathology was determined by HE 
staining. Immunofluorescence was employed to detect the expression of α-SMA and 
Nrf-2. Level of oxidative stress and matrix metalloproteinases were examined by 
ELISA kits. Cell viability and cell cycle of primary airway smooth muscle cells 
(ASMCs) were evaluated by CCK8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Signal 
molecules were detected using western blot.
RESULTS: Tetrandrine effectively impairs OVA-induced airway inflammatory and 
airway remodeling by inhibiting the expression of CysLT1 and CysLTR1. The 
increase of oxidative stress and subsequent enhancement of MMP9 and TGF-β1 
expression were rescued by the administration of Tetrandrine in the rat model of 
asthma. In in vitro experiments, Tetrandrine markedly suppressed TGF-β1-evoked 
cell viability and cell cycle promotion of ASMCs in a dose-dependent manner. 
Furthermore, Tetrandrine promoted Nrf-2 nuclear transcription and activated its 
downstream HO-1 in vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSION: Tetrandrine attenuates airway inflammatory and airway remodeling in 
rat model of asthma and TGF-β1-induced cell proliferation of ASMCs by regulating 
oxidative stress in primary ASMCs, suggesting that Tetrandrine possibly is an 
effective candidate therapy for asthma.

T cells play an essential role in the pathogenesis of both human rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and its murine models. A key molecule in T cell activation is 
ZAP-70, therefore we aimed to investigate the effects of partial ZAP-70 
deficiency on the pathogenesis of recombinant human G1(rhG1)-induced arthritis 
(GIA), a well-established mouse model of RA. Arthritis was induced in BALB/c and 
ZAP-70+/- heterozygous mice. Disease progression was monitored using a scoring 
system and in vivo imaging, antigen-specific proliferation, cytokine and 
autoantibody production was measured and T cell apoptotic pathways were 
analyzed. ZAP-70+/- mice developed a less severe arthritis, as shown by both 
clinical picture and in vitro parameters (decreased T cell proliferation, 
cytokine and autoantibody production). The amount of cleaved Caspase-3 increased 
in arthritic ZAP-70+/- T cells, with no significant changes in cleaved Caspase-8 
and -9 levels; although expression of Bim, Bcl-2 and Cytochrome C showed 
alterations. Tyrosine phosphorylation was less pronounced in arthritic ZAP-70+/- 
T cells and the amount of Cbl-b-a negative regulator of T cell 
activation-decreased as well. We hypothesize that the less severe disease seen 
in the partial absence of ZAP-70 might be caused by the decreased T cell 
activation accompanied by increased apoptosis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease which impacts a large 
number of patients worldwide, and new drugs are required for lower the disease 
burden. Theaflavin-3, 3'-digallate (TFDG) is polyphenol exhibiting inhibition on 
inflammatory factors. This study aimed to explore the attenuation of TFDG on RA. 
The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was established and 
administered with TFDG. The arthritis score and incidence was recorded to assess 
the amelioration of TFDG on arthritis. Histopathological change of the mouse 
joint tissues was evaluated by haemotoxylin and eosin staining. The expression 
of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 was quantified by ELISA. The activation of nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in 
the synovium were determined by Western blotting. In comparison with the 
control, administration of TFDG significantly reduced arthritis score and 
incidence in the CIA mouse model. TFDG significantly suppressed the expression 
of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as the levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3 in 
the synovium. TFDG also showed remarkable inhibition on the activation of NF-κB 
and the phosphorylation of P38, JNK2, and ERK. This study puts up evidence that 
TFDG exerts protection on RA via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB- and 
MAPK-signaling pathways.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by persistent 
synovial inflammation. The major drivers of synovial inflammation are cytokines 
and chemokines. Among these molecules, TNF activates fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLSs), which leads to the production of inflammatory mediators. 
Here, we show that TNF regulates the expression of the transcription factor 
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in human FLSs as well as in a TNF 
transgenic arthritis mouse model. Transcriptomic analyses of IRF1-deficient, 
TNF-stimulated FLSs define the interferon (IFN) pathway as a major target of 
IRF1. IRF1 expression is associated with the expression of IFNβ, which leads to 
the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Blocking the JAK-STAT pathway with the 
Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKinib) baricitinib or tofacitinib reduces the 
expression of IFN-regulated genes (IRGs) in TNF-activated FLSs. Therefore, we 
conclude that TNF induces a distinct inflammatory cascade, in which IRGs are key 
elements, in FLSs. The IFN-signature might be a promising biomarker for the 
efficient and personalized use of new treatment strategies for RA, such as 
JAKinibs.

OBJECTIVES: The creation of a new valid preclinical model of articular pain by 
the intra-articular (i.a.) injection of mucilages for the screening of new 
treatments against arthritis.
METHODS: A single intra-articular injection (20 μl) of mucilages (from Althaea 
officinalis roots and Linum usitatissimun seeds) or vegetal components 
(Amorphophallus konjac gum powder and β-glucan, used as reference standard) were 
assessed in the rat. The pathology progression was monitored by behavioural 
measurements (paw pressure test, von Frey test, incapacitance test and beam 
balance test) and compared to that induced by the i.a. injections of 
monoiodioacetate (MIA) and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), well-recognized 
models of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: Among all, the mucilage of L. usitatissimun showed the best 
pro-algic profile inducing a painful long-lasting condition. Hypersensitivity 
was characterized as a mixed form of inflammatory and neuropathic pain by the 
responsiveness to ibuprofen (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and pregabalin (30 mg/kg, p.o.). 
The histological evaluation of joint showed a damage that represents both MIA 
and CFA features.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a single i.a. injection of L. usitatissimun mucilage 
can represent a valid model to assess articular pain in the rat for the 
screening of new treatments against arthritis.

Super-small nanoclusters may intrinsically trigger specific molecular pathway 
for disease treatment in vitro/vivo. To prove the hypothesis the super-small 
nanoclusters, e.g., Au clusters, are directly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) in vitro/vivo. RA is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by 
the inflammation of joints and the unreversible destruction of the 
cartilage/bone. Au clusters significantly suppress lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced proinflammatory mediator production in the murine macrophage cell 
line by inhibiting the signaling pathways that regulate the major 
proinflammatory mediator genes. In preclinical rat RA studies, Au clusters 
strongly prevent type II collagen-induced rat RA without systemic side effects. 
Compared with the clinical first-line anchored anti-RA drug, methotrexate, Au 
clusters equally inhibit inflammation in vivo. Type II collagen-induced rat RA 
is characterized with the destruction of cartilage/bone; treatment with Au 
clusters reverses the destruction of cartilage/bone to its normal state. This is 
because Au clusters directly inhibit receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB 
ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation and function through the 
downregulation of osteoclast-specific genetic marker expression. However the 
methotrexate almost has no positive effect for this key issue in rat RA therapy. 
These data prove that the super-small nanoclusters, e.g., Au clusters, could be 
a novel candidate nanodrug for RA treatment.

Severe rheumatoid cachexia is associated with pronounced loss of muscle and fat 
mass in patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis. This condition is 
associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. 
Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) have not yet 
been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the metabolism of 
these lipids in the arthritic liver has not yet been clarified. Aiming at 
filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating 
lipid profile and of the fatty acids uptake and metabolism in perfused livers of 
rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol 
were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and liver (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The 
levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in 
consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and 
oxidation of palmitic and oleic acids was higher in arthritic livers. The 
phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic liver. 
Indeed, NADPH/NADP+ and NADH/NAD+ ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, 
which additionally presented higher activities of the citric acid cycle driven 
by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and 
hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced 
synthesis of fatty acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the 
lipid hepatic metabolism in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, 
a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for 
arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether microRNA-421 could 
participate in the proliferative, migratory and inflammatory changes of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis by targeting SPRY1.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expressions of microRNA-421 and SPRY1 in synovial 
tissues and FLS were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain 
Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The binding condition between 
microRNA-421 and SPRY1 was verified by the Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay. 
MicroRNA-421 mimics and inhibitor were constructed and transfected. The levels 
of extracellular interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and COX2 in FLS after microRNA-421 
mimics or inhibitor transfection were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). The regulatory effect of microRNA-421 on the proliferation and 
migration of FLS was detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell 
assay, respectively. Furthermore, collagen-induced RA mouse model was 
constructed to confirm the specific effect of microRNA-421 on regulating RA 
development.
RESULTS: MicroRNA-421 was highly expressed in the synovial tissues of RA 
patients. SPRY1 expression in FLS was negatively regulated by microRNA-421. 
Moreover, the overexpression of microRNA-421 significantly promoted 
proliferative, invasive potentials and inflammatory response of FLS. In vivo, RA 
mouse model indicated that downregulated microRNA-421 and upregulated SPRY1 were 
observed in mice injected with cortisone and microRNA-421 inhibitor when 
compared with those of controls.
CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-421 promotes the inflammatory response of fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis by downregulating the SPRY1 expression.

The pathogenic relationship of ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis is 
not known. Therefore, we examined dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis 
separately and in combination with a mouse arthritis model that mimics 
rheumatoid arthritis and evaluated the deterioration-related factors of each 
condition. Arthritis was induced in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model 
using DBA/1JJmsSlc mice and ulcerative colitis was induced by the administration 
of drinking water containing 3.0% (w/v) DSS. The arthritis/DSS-treated mice 
developed worse colitis scores compared to that of the other groups of mice. The 
arthritis/DSS-treated mice did not demonstrate changes in hind foot volumes or 
in the concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in the plasma; 
however, plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
were increased. Our results showed that IL-6 and TNF-α may influence the 
deterioration effect of colitis in arthritic mice.

The present study evaluated the protective effects of pseurotin A against 
inflammation and the destruction of cartilage in a rat model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). RA was induced by intradermal injections of Freund's complete 
adjuvant (1 mg/mL), and the treatment with pseurotin A (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) 
was administered over 1 week. The effects of pseurotin A were assessed by 
estimating hind paw volume (HPV) and determining the levels of inflammatory 
mediators in the serum and synovial fluid of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA)-induced RA rats. Western blot and histopathological assays were performed 
to assess changes in synovial tissues. Additionally, in vitro analyses of 
receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-Β ligand (RANKL)-stimulated RAW264.7 
cells treated with pseurotin A at different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 
µg/mL) were conducted to assess the effects of pseurotin A on apoptosis ratio, 
real-time polymerase chain reaction data, and tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase staining. Compared to the RA group, treatment with pseurotin A 
significantly decreased HPV and reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators in 
the synovial fluid and blood. Additionally, pseurotin A ameliorated the protein 
expressions of osteoprotegerin, nuclear factor of activated T-cells, nuclear 
factor-kappa beta (NF-κB), IκBα, extracellular signal regulated kinase, and P38 
as well as histopathological changes in the synovial tissue of CIA-induced RA 
rats. The in vitro findings revealed that pseurotin A treatment did not alter 
the apoptosis ratio in RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells but significantly reduced 
the mRNA expressions of calcitonin receptor, NF-κB, and matrix 
metallopeptidase-9. The present findings suggest that pseurotin A ameliorated 
the differentiation of osteoclasts and the destruction of cartilage in RA rats 
via regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/RANKL/NF-kB pathway.

Interleukin (IL)-37, a pivotal anti-inflammatory cytokine and a fundamental 
inhibitor of innate immunity, has recently been shown to be abnormally expressed 
in several autoimmune-related orthopedic diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoporosis. However, the role of IL-37 
during osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains 
largely unknown. In this study, extracellular IL-37 significantly increased 
osteoblast-specific gene expression, the number of mineral deposits, and 
alkaline phosphatase activity of MSCs. Moreover, a signaling pathway was 
activated in the presence of IL-37. The enhanced osteogenic differentiation of 
MSCs due to supplementation of IL-37 was partially rescued by the presence of a 
PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitor. Using a rat calvarial bone defect model, IL-37 
significantly improved bone healing. Collectively, these findings indicate that 
extracellular IL-37 enhanced osteogenesis of MSCs, at least in part by 
activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Iguratimod is a new synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug intended to 
treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A new method using recombinant human 
CYP450s yeast cells containing c-DNA expressed P450s was applied to identify the 
metabolic pathways of iguratimod and to prepare its metabolite. The metabolite 
was isolated, and its structure was identified by quadrupole time-of-flight-mass 
spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Furthermore, a selective and 
sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed for 
the simultaneous quantification of iguratimod and its major metabolite in rat 
plasma for the first time. The results indicated that iguratimod was mainly 
metabolized to a metabolite by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in in-vitro study. The 
structure of the metabolite was identified as M2 
(N-[3-(acetamido)-4-oxo-6-phenoxy-4H-chromen-7-yl]methanesulfonamide). HPLC 
assay was achieved on a C18 column using methanol-water containing 0.1% 
trifluoroacetic acid (55:45 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at 
257 nm. Standard calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 
0.5-20 µg/mL for iguratimod and its metabolite M2. The lower limits of detection 
of iguratimod and M2 in rat plasma were 0.1 and 0.25 µg/mL, respectively. The 
intra- and inter-day precision (RSD%) were within 5% for the two analytes. The 
average recoveries of the analytes were greater than 90%. In conclusion, 
recombinant human CYP450s whole-yeast transformation system could be 
successfully used to identify and prepare the major metabolite of iguratimod. 
The HPLC method we developed could be successfully applied to evaluate 
pharmacokinetics of iguratimod and its metabolite M2 in rats.

We explored whether transforming growth factor (TGF-β)/Smads signaling pathway 
influences rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and 
proliferation of RA synovial fibroblast (RA-SF). Expression levels of TGF-β1 in 
RA + PF patients, RA patients and healthy controls were determined. Rat models 
of RA were successfully induced and assigned into groups. The mRNA, 
phosphorylation and protein expressions of TGF-β1, Smad2 and Smad3 were 
detected. The serum expressions of inflammatory factors were measured by ELISA. 
Tissue sections were observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson staining. 
The SF cells were separated and grouped. Cell viability and migration were 
determined. The highest expressions of TGF-β1 were found in RA + PF patients, 
followed by RA patients and then healthy controls. RA + PF rats were 
characterized by less activity, worse appetite, messy and less shining hair, 
thin sloppy stool and increased joint swelling. Compared with the normal group, 
the expressions of TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3, IL-6 and TNF-α were elevated in the RA 
+ PF group. Meanwhile, the swelling and pulmonary fibrosis of lung tissues was 
worse, the lung capacity and serum level of IL-10 were decreased. However, 
SB431542 can reverse the above results. The cell activity and cell migration 
ability of cells in the RA + PF + SB431542 group were inhibited compared to 
those in the blank group. Based on above findings, the inhibition of the 
TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway alleviates the pulmonary fibrosis in rats with RA 
and suppresses cell viability and migration of synovial fibroblasts.

Reactive oxygen species have been involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Our goal was to determine the effects of selectively scavenging 
superoxide (O2•-) and hydroxyl radicals with antioxidant nanoparticles, called 
poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCCs), on 
the pathogenic functions of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and on the progression of an animal model of RA. 
We used human FLS from patients with RA to determine PEG-HCC internalization and 
effects on FLS cytotoxicity, invasiveness, proliferation, and production of 
proteases. We used the pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) rat model of RA to 
assess the benefits of PEG-HCCs on reducing disease severity. PEG-HCCs were 
internalized by RA-FLS, reduced their intracellular O2•-, and reduced multiple 
measures of their pathogenicity in vitro, including proliferation and invasion. 
In PIA, PEG-HCCs caused a 65% reduction in disease severity, as measured by a 
standardized scoring system of paw inflammation and caused a significant 
reduction in bone and tissue damage, and circulating rheumatoid factor. PEG-HCCs 
did not induce lymphopenia during PIA. Our study demonstrated a role for O2•- 
and hydroxyl radicals in the pathogenesis of a rat model of RA and showed 
efficacy of PEG-HCCs in treating a rat model of RA.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune disease and 
affects about 1% of the population. The cause of RA remains largely unknown and 
could result from a complex interaction between genes and environment factors. 
Recent studies suggested that gut microbiota and their collective metabolic 
outputs exert profound effects on the host immune system and are implicated in 
RA. However, which and how gut microbial metabolites interact with host genetics 
in contributing to RA pathogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we present a 
data-driven study to understand how gut microbial metabolites contribute to RA 
at the genetic, functional and phenotypic levels.
RESULTS: We used publicly available disease genetics, chemical genetics, human 
metabolome, genetic signaling pathways, mouse genome-wide mutation phenotypes, 
and mouse phenotype ontology data. We identified RA-associated microbial 
metabolites and prioritized them based on their genetic, functional and 
phenotypic relevance to RA. We evaluated the prioritization methods using 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which were previously shown to be involved in 
RA etiology. We validate the algorithms by showing that SCFAs are highly 
associated with RA at genetic, functional and phenotypic levels: SCFAs ranked at 
top 3.52% based on shared genes with RA, top 5.69% based on shared genetic 
pathways, and top 16.94% based on shared phenotypes. Based on the genetic-level 
analysis, human gut microbial metabolites directly interact with many 
RA-associated genes (as many as 18.1% of all 166 RA genes). Based on the 
functional-level analysis, human gut microbial metabolites participate in many 
RA-associated genetic pathways (as many as 71.4% of 311 genetic pathways 
significantly enriched for RA), including immune system pathways. Based on the 
phenotypic-level analysis, gut microbial metabolites affect many RA-related 
phenotypes (as many as 51.3% of 978 phenotypes significantly enriched for RA), 
including many immune system phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates strong gut-microbiome-immune-joint 
interactions in RA, which converged on both genetic, functional and phenotypic 
levels.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against B cell antigens are extensively used in the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The B cell depletion therapy prevents RA 
symptoms and/or alleviates existing inflammation. The previously established 
two-step drug-free macromolecular therapeutics (DFMT) is applied in the 
treatment of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis in a collagen-induced 
rheumatoid arthritis mouse model. DFMT is a B cell depletion strategy utilizing 
Fab' fragment of anti-CD20 mAb for biorecognition and receptor crosslinking to 
induce B cell apoptosis. DFMT is composed from two nanoconjugates: 1) bispecific 
engager, Fab'-MORF1 (anti-CD20 Fab' fragment conjugated with morpholino 
oligonucleotide MORF1), and 2) a crosslinking (effector) component P-(MORF2)X 
(N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer grafted with multiple copies of 
complementary morpholino oligonucleotide MORF2). The absence of Fc fragment has 
the potential to avoid development of resistance and infusion-related reactions. 
DFMT produces B cell depletion, keeps the RA score low for more than 100 days, 
and shows minimal cartilage and bone erosion and inflammatory cell infiltration. 
Further improvements will be explored to optimize DFMT strategy in autoimmune 
disease treatment.

Camperdown, NSW Australia.

Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the most common forms of arthritis, are 
chronic, painful, and disabling conditions. Although both diseases differ in 
etiology, they manifest in progressive joint destruction characterized by 
pathological changes in the articular cartilage, bone, and synovium. While the 
potent anti-inflammatory properties of therapeutic (i.e., exogenous) 
glucocorticoids have been heavily researched and are widely used in clinical 
practice, the role of endogenous glucocorticoids in arthritis susceptibility and 
disease progression remains poorly understood. Current evidence from mouse 
models suggests that local endogenous glucocorticoid signaling is upregulated by 
the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in rheumatoid arthritis and by 
aging-related mechanisms in osteoarthritis. Furthermore, these models indicate 
that endogenous glucocorticoid signaling in macrophages, mast cells, and 
chondrocytes has anti-inflammatory effects, while signaling in fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes, myocytes, osteoblasts, and osteocytes has pro-inflammatory actions 
in rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, in osteoarthritis, endogenous 
glucocorticoid signaling in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes has destructive 
actions. Together these studies provide insights into the role of endogenous 
glucocorticoids in the pathogenesis of both inflammatory and degenerative joint 
disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause 
irreversible joint deformity. There is still no cure for RA, and current 
therapeutics, including methotrexate and adalimumab, cause serious off-target 
effects and systemic immunosuppression, which in turn increases the risk of 
infection. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) in macrophages and B cells has been 
demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic target for RA. However, high doses of 
BTK inhibitors are required for efficient BTK suppression, which limits their 
clinical use. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is promising for the silencing of 
specific genes and has been used for the treatment of multiple diseases. To 
deliver siRNA into macrophages and B cells for BTK gene silencing, we employed 
cationic lipid-assisted PEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles (CLANs) to encapsulate siRNA. 
We demonstrated that macrophages and B cells were able to efficiently ingest the 
CLANs both in vitro and in vivo. Thereafter, we encapsulated siRNA targeting BTK 
(siBTK) into the CLANs, denoted as CLANsiBTK, and demonstrated that CLANsiBTK 
significantly inhibited BTK expression in macrophages and B cells. In a 
collagen-induced mouse arthritis model, CLANsiBTK treatment dramatically reduced 
joint inflammation and other RA symptoms but showed no toxicity, proving that 
using CLANsiBTK is a promising approach for RA therapy.

Oral treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the immunomodulator, 
leflunomide (LEF), is associated with systemic side effects namely 
immunosuppression and hepatotoxicity. Herein, attempts to improve LEF 
therapeutic outcomes via nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) targeting inflamed 
rheumatic joints were executed. LEF-NLCs coated with either chondroitin sulphate 
(CHS) or chitosan (CS) were around 250 nm in size with negative or positive 
charge, respectively. Particle coating was evidenced by TEM and FTIR analysis. 
NLCs generally ensured sustained release profile up to 21 days, particularly 
extended in coated formulations. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of LEF 
suspension, uncoated NLCs, CHS- and CS-coated NLCs was carried out. Following 
oral administration in RA-induced rat model, joint diameter, paw inflammation, 
liver functions were measured, in addition to histological examination of liver, 
kidney and joints. Results revealed improved joint healing and reduced 
hepatotoxicity following treatment with nanoencapsulated LEF compared to LEF 
suspension, whereby CHS-NLCs ensued the highest Cmax, AUC and lowest TNF-α 
level. The dual potential of CHS to achieve active targeting to CD44-receptor 
and hence maximize LEF concentration at the target site in addition to its 
synergistic effect in joint healing endow promises for a competent oral 
nanosystem for targeted drug delivery to the joints.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that 
eventually leads to joint deformities and loss of joint function. Previous 
studies have demonstrated a close relationship between autophagy and the 
development of RA. Although autophagy and apoptosis are two different forms of 
programmed death, the relationship between them in relation to RA remains 
unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of autophagy on apoptosis of 
articular chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Adjuvant arthritis (AA) and 
acid-induced primary articular chondrocyte apoptosis were used as in vivo and in 
vitro models, respectively. Articular chondrocyte autophagy and apoptosis were 
both observed dynamically in AA rat articular cartilage at different stages 
(15 days, 25 days and 35 days). Moreover, chondrocyte apoptosis and articular 
cartilage injury in AA rats were increased by the autophagy inhibitor 
3-methyladenine (3-MA) and decreased by the autophagy activator rapamycin. In 
addition, pre-treatment with 3-MA increased acid-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, 
while pre-treatment with rapamycin reduced acid-induced chondrocyte apoptosis in 
vitro. These results suggest that autophagy might be a potential target for the 
treatment of RA.

Rhesus theta defensin-1 (RTD-1), a macrocyclic immunomodulatory host defense 
peptide from Old World monkeys, is therapeutic in pristane-induced arthritis 
(PIA) in rats, a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) 
analysis was used to interrogate the changes in gene expression in PIA rats, 
which identified 617 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PIA synovial 
tissue of diseased rats. Upstream regulator analysis showed upregulation of gene 
expression pathways regulated by TNF, IL1B, IL6, proinflammatory cytokines, and 
matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) involved in RA. In contrast, ligand-dependent 
nuclear receptors like the liver X-receptors NR1H2 and NR1H3 and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) were downregulated in arthritic 
synovia. Daily RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats for 1-5 days following disease 
presentation modulated 340 of the 617 disease genes, and synovial gene 
expression in PIA rats treated 5 days with RTD-1 closely resembled the gene 
signature of naive synovium. Systemic RTD-1 inhibited proinflammatory upstream 
regulators such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 and activated antiarthritic 
ligand-dependent nuclear receptor pathways, including PPARG, NR1H2, and NR1H3, 
that were suppressed in untreated PIA rats. RTD-1 also inhibited proinflammatory 
responses in IL-1β-stimulated human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in 
vitro and diminished expression of human orthologs of disease genes that are 
induced in rat PIA synovium. Thus, the antiarthritic mechanisms of systemic 
RTD-1 include homeostatic regulation of arthritogenic gene networks in a manner 
that correlates temporally with clinical resolution of rat PIA.

Glucocorticoids have been confirmed to be effective in the treatment of a 
variety of inflammatory diseases. However, their application encounters 
limitations in terms of tissue distribution and bioavailability in vivo. To 
address these key issues, we designed and developed a nanopreparation by using 
egg yolk lecithin/sodium glycocholate (EYL/SGC) and utilize such mixed micelles 
(MMs) to encapsulate dexamethasone palmitate (DMP) for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The prepared DMP-MMs had an average particle size of 
49.18 ± 0.43 nm and were compared with an emulsion-based dexamethasone 
palmitate. Pharmacokinetic and in vivo fluorescence imaging showed that mixed 
micelles had higher bioavailability and targeting efficiency in inflammatory 
sites. An arthritis rat model was established via induction by Complete Freund's 
Adjuvant (CFA), followed by the efficacy studies by the observations of paw 
volume, histology, spleen index, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CT images. It 
was confirmed that intravenous injection of DMP-MMs exhibited advantages in 
alleviating joint inflammation compared with the emulsion system. Composed of 
pharmaceutical adjuvants only, the nanoscale mixed micelles seem a promising 
carrier system for the RA treatment with lipophilic drugs.

University, Cairo, Egypt.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a primary chronic articular disease with 
wide range of extra-articular and systemic effects. The spleen is one of the 
most affected organs in RA. CD4+ T cells play an important role in initiation, 
maintenance and control of the disease.
AIM OF THE WORK: This work was designed to study the histological changes 
occurring in the spleen in a rat model of RA and to assess the effect of 
treatment with omega-3 alone, with special refer to the role of CD4+ T-cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male albino rats were divided into four groups; 
control group, early and progressive RA groups and omega-3 treated group. RA was 
induced in rats of groups II, III and IV by a single subcutaneous injection of 
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Samples were taken after two and four weeks of 
the CFA injection (in early and progressive RA groups respectively). Treatment 
with omega-3 (300 mg/kg/day in a single, daily oral dose) started two weeks 
after CFA injection in rats of group IV and continued for another two weeks. 
Spleen specimens were collected at the appropriate times and processed to obtain 
paraffin blocks. Sections were then stained for histological and 
immunofluorescence studies.
RESULTS: Both, early and progressive RA induced noticeable structural changes in 
the spleen. Thickened capsule and trabeculae and marked congestion of the blood 
sinusoids of the red pulp were evident. Expansion of the white pulp and areas of 
mononuclear cellular infiltration were seen, especially in progressive RA. 
Affection of blood vessel walls was also noticed. Immunofluorescence study 
showed extensive expression of Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibodies especially in 
progressive RA. Treatment with omega-3 significantly improved the structure of 
the spleen as detected by both histological and immunofluorescence studies.
CONCLUSION: Omega-3 treatment ameliorated the structural damage of the spleen 
caused by experimental induction of RA.

OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported that the coactivation of NF-κB and STAT3 
in nonimmune cells, including synovial fibroblasts, enhances the expression of 
NF-κB target genes and plays a role in chronic inflammation and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). This study was undertaken to examine the role of NF-κB 
activation in chondrocytes and better understand the pathogenesis of RA. 
Furthermore, transmembrane protein 147 (TMEM147) was investigated as a 
representative NF-κB activator in chondrocytes.
METHODS: Clinical samples from RA patients were analyzed by 
immunohistochemistry. Specimens obtained from patients with polydactyly were 
used as control samples. The functional contribution of chondrocytes and TMEM147 
to arthritis was examined in several murine models of RA. In vitro experiments 
(quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA interference, immunoprecipitation, 
and confocal microscopy) were performed to investigate the mechanism of action 
of TMEM147 in chondrocytes.
RESULTS: Samples obtained from RA patients and mouse models of RA showed 
coactivation of NF-κB and STAT3 in chondrocytes (P < 0.001). This coactivation 
induced a synergistic expression of NF-κB targets in vitro (P < 0.01). 
Chondrocyte-specific deletion of STAT3 significantly suppressed the development 
of cytokine-induced RA (P < 0.01). TMEM147 was highly expressed in chondrocytes 
from RA patient samples and the mouse models of RA. Gene silencing of TMEM147 or 
anti-TMEM147 antibody treatment inhibited the cytokine-mediated activation of 
NF-κB in vitro (P < 0.01) and suppressed cytokine-induced RA in vivo (P < 0.01). 
Mechanistically, TMEM147 molecules acted as scaffold proteins for the NF-κB 
complex, which included breakpoint cluster region and casein kinase 2, and 
enhanced NF-κB activity.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that chondrocytes play a role in the 
development of RA via TMEM147-mediated NF-κB activation and indicate a novel 
therapeutic strategy for RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic and systemic autoimmune disease, which affects 
approximately 1% of the adult population worldwide. The present study 
investigated the therapeutic effect of theacrine (TC) on arthritis and its 
mechanisms in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA)-induced SD rats. Rats were 
randomly divided into 5 groups: i) healthy control; ii) model; iii) positive 
control with methotrexate (MTX); iv) treatment with 12.5 mg/kg TC; and v) 
treatment with 25.0 mg/kg TC. The apparent scores, including changes in body 
weights, degree of paw swelling and arthritis indicators, were analyzed to 
evaluate the anti-chronic inflammatory effect of TC. The levels of interleukin 
(IL)-6 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in serum were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein and RNA expression levels of the 
critical factors in rats were measured to elucidate the mechanisms responsible 
for chronic inflammation and to verify molecular indexes of chronic inflammatory 
conditions. TC notably suppressed the severity of FIA-induced rat by attenuating 
the apparent scores, animal weight and inflammatory indexes in the 25 mg/kg TC 
group compared with the FIA rat model. Furthermore, TC significantly decreased 
the levels of IL-6 and increased the levels of TGF-β. Histopathological 
examinations indicated that TC rescued the synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory 
cell infiltration in joint tissues. In addition, TC enhanced TGF-β-mediated 
shifts in inflammatory marker expression in joint tissue. Overall, the present 
study demonstrated that TC exerted a superior anti-arthritic effect via the 
suppression of IL-6 and the activation of TGF-β by the TGF-β/SMAD pathway.

Comment in
    J Chin Med Assoc. 2019 May;82(5):341-342.

BACKGROUND: We decided to study the association of monocyte 
α-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (ST3Gal-1), neuraminidase-3 (Neu3), 
α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-1), and neuraminidase-1 (Neu1) levels with 
disease activity score 28 (DAS28) in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
considering that mouse monocytes' sialic acid (SIA) levels relate to their 
phagocytosis and IgG binding ability.
METHODS: ST3Gal-1, Neu3, ST6Gal-1, Neu1, α-2,3-SIA, and α-2,6-SIA levels on RA 
peripheral blood monocytes, T cells, and polymorphonuclear cells were determined 
by using fluorochrome-conjugated anti-cell-specific marker antibodies and 
fluorochrome-conjugated anti-enzyme antibodies. Simple correlation and linear 
regression were used to correlate enzyme levels with DAS28.
RESULTS: RA monocyte ST3Gal-1 and Neu3 levels correlated with DAS28 in patients 
having DAS28 >5.1 (r = 0.469, p = 0.002; r = 0.410, p = 0.006, respectively). 
When multivariable analysis was performed for erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and SIA-related enzyme levels in different cell 
types as independent variables with DAS28 as a dependent variable, monocyte 
ST3Gal-1 levels correlated with DAS28 (p = 0.009) but not ESR and CRP in 
patients having DAS28 >5.1 (both p ≥ 0.292). RA monocyte ST3Gal-1 levels 
correlated with DAS28 (p = 0.010) and with ESR (p < 0.001) at month 0 when 
applied to all RA patients including both remission and nonremission groups in 
multivariable analysis. The latter findings persisted longitudinally at month 3.
CONCLUSION: Monocyte ST3Gal-1 and Neu3 levels correlated longitudinally with 
DAS28 by two different methods suggest that monocyte ST3Gal-1 and Neu3 levels 
may be used as biomarkers to monitor RA disease activity.

BACKGROUND: As a type of chronic autoimmune joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) is a disorder, characterized by a variety of physical symptoms as well as 
RA fibroblast-like synoviocyte (RA-FLS) proliferation. More recently, long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the progression of various 
diseases including the progression of RA. Hence, the aim of the current study 
was to investigate the role by which the lncRNA, plasmacytoma variant 
translocation 1 (PVT1), influences RA-FLSs and its ability to modulate the 
methylation of sirtuin 6 (sirt6).
METHODS: RA rat models were initially established to determine the expression of 
PVT1 and sirt6 in synovial tissues and RA-FLSs. Elevation or depletion of PVT1 
or sirt6 was achieved by means of transformation with plasmids in order to 
investigate their effects on RA-FLS proliferation, inflammation and apoptosis. 
The localization of PVT1 and its binding ability to the sirt6 promoter region 
were also explored in an attempt to elucidate the correlation between PVT1 and 
sirt6 methylation.
RESULTS: High expression of PVT1 and low expression of sirt6 were detected in 
the synovial tissues and RA-FLSs of the rat models. RA-FLSs treated with sh-PVT1 
or oe-sirt6 exhibited suppressed cell proliferation, inflammation and induced 
apoptosis. PVT1 was predominately localized in the nucleus while evidence was 
obtained indicating that it could bind to the sirt6 promoter to induce sirt6 
methylation, thus inhibiting sirt6 transcription. PVT1 knockdown was observed to 
restore sirt6 expression through decreasing sirt6 methylation, thereby 
alleviating RA.
CONCLUSION: The key findings of the study provide evidence suggesting that, PVT1 
knockdown is able to restrain RA progression by inhibiting sirt6 methylation to 
restore its expression.

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate triptolide-loaded cubic 
and hexagonal liquid crystals for transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDSs). We 
prepared and characterized triptolide-loaded lyotropic liquid crystals and 
evaluated for their percutaneous permeation properties in vitro and in vivo. We 
then used the adjuvant arthritic rat model and HaCaT cells to analyze the 
pharmacodynamics and conduct cell-stimulating studies of these liquid crystals. 
The optimized preparations were identified as cubic and hexagonal phase 
structures, respectively. Moreover, the in vitro percutaneous penetration 
studies demonstrated that compared to the homemade triptolide gel, cubic and 
hexagonal liquid crystals could significantly increase the percutaneous 
cumulative penetration of drugs within 48 h. Besides, the results of skin-blood 
synchronous microdialysis showed that the triptolide concentration in skin was 
higher than that in blood, and the cubic and hexagonal liquid crystals 
significantly increased the bioavailability of triptolide. Triptolide-loaded 
cubic and hexagonal liquid crystals presented excellent anti-arthritic effects, 
alleviating paw swelling and inhibiting inflammation by downregulating the 
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro cell-stimulating studies displayed that 
triptolide-loaded cubic and hexagonal liquid crystals exhibited no obvious 
toxicity, which exhibited that triptolide-loaded cubic and hexagonal liquid 
crystals were remarkable biocompatibility. Collectively, triptolide-loaded cubic 
and hexagonal liquid crystals represented a promising candidate for rheumatoid 
arthritis therapy.

Emerging evidence shows that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression can be 
induced by the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. 
Regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1) is observed to be a candidate 
biomarker for arthritis. Accordingly, the present study aims to determine the 
potential effects of RGS1 mediating TLR on RA. A rat model of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) was established to mimic the features of RA by injection of 
bovine type II collagen. The rats with CIA were treated with short hairpin RNA 
(shRNA) against RGS1 or TLR pathway activator Poly I:C to elucidate the role of 
RGS1 in RA progression. The inflammatory factors were measured, and the thoracic 
gland and spleen indexes as well as the vascular density were determined. The 
expression levels of RGS1, TLR3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and interleukin 1 receptor-associated 
kinase-4 (IRAK4) were determined. RGS1 was robustly increased in RA. The TLR 
signaling pathway was suppressed by RGS1 silencing. shRNA-mediated depletion of 
RGS1 was shown to significantly enhance thoracic gland index and inhibit the 
serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-17, spleen index, vascular density, and the 
expression levels of TLR3, VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, and IRAK4. However, when the rats 
with CIA were treated with Poly I:C, the trend of effects was opposite. These 
findings highlight that functional suppression of RGS1 inhibits the inflammatory 
response and angiogenesis by inactivating the TLR signaling pathway in rats with 
CIA, thereby providing a novel therapeutic target for RA treatment.

Much interest surrounds the receptors α2β1 and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) whose 
synchronized action mediates the attachment and activation of platelets on 
collagen, essential for preventing blood loss but also the most thrombogenic 
component of the vessel wall. Subject to density variations on platelets through 
natural polymorphisms, the absence of α2β1 or GPVI uniquely leads to a 
substantial block of hemostasis without causing major bleeding. Specific to the 
megakaryocyte lineage, GPVI and its signaling pathways are most promising 
targets for anti-thrombotic therapy. This review looks at the clinical 
consequences of the loss of collagen receptor function with emphasis on both the 
inherited and acquired loss of GPVI with brief mention of mouse models when 
necessary. A detailed survey of rare case reports of patients with inherited 
disease-causing variants of the GP6 gene is followed by an assessment of the 
causes and clinical consequences of acquired GPVI deficiency, a more frequent 
finding most often due to antibody-induced platelet GPVI shedding. Release of 
soluble GPVI is brought about by platelet metalloproteinases; a process induced 
by ligand or antibody binding to GPVI or even high shear forces. Also included 
is an assessment of the clinical importance of GPVI-mediated platelet 
interactions with fibrin and of the promise shown by the pharmacological 
inhibition of GPVI in a cardiovascular context. The role for GPVI in platelet 
function in inflammation and in the evolution and treatment of major illnesses 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and sepsis is also discussed.

Anacardium occidentale (cashew) has been used in the traditional system of 
medicine for curing many inflammatory disorders. The present study investigates 
the antiarthritic effects of cashew leaves extract using the rat model of 
FCA-induced rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritic rats were treated with 100 and 
200 mg/kg b.w. ethanolic extract of cashew leaves. Animals were sacrificed at 
day 23, and before sacrificing the animals, gross pathological changes were 
observed. Histopathology of ankle joint was evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin 
staining, whereas the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated by 
the agglutination method. Inflammatory cells and other hematological parameters 
were assessed by employing an automated hemocytometer and chemistry analyzer. 
Rheumatoid factor (Rf) and lysosomal enzymes levels were determined in blood. 
Results indicated that A. occidentale significantly decreased the CPR levels, 
macroscopic arthritic score, and rheumatoid factor as compared to the diseased 
group. Histopathological evaluation showed significant attenuation in bone 
erosion, joint inflammation, and pannus formation by plant extract. Treatment 
with A. occidentale significantly suppressed the levels of acid phosphatase, 
β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and collagenase. 
Moreover, A. occidentale significantly raised the HB levels and RBCs counts 
which were found depleted in the diseased group. The raised counts of total 
leukocytes, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were also 
significantly decreased by treatment with plant extract. Comparative analysis 
showed that higher dose of A. occidentale demonstrated superior amelioration of 
rheumatoid arthritis as compared to low dose. In conclusion, A. occidentale 
possesses significant antiarthritic potential, which may be attributed to the 
suppression of lysosomal enzymes and collagenase levels.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) frequently suffer from muscle weakness. 
We examined whether eccentric training prevents skeletal muscle weakness in 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat, a widely used animal model for RA. AIA was 
induced in the knees of Wistar rats by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant. 
To induce eccentric contractions (ECCs), neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
(45 V) was applied to the plantar flexor muscles simultaneously with forced 
dorsiflexion of the ankle joint (0-40°) and was given every 6 s. ECC exercise 
was applied every other day for a total of 11 sessions and consisted of 4 sets 
of 5 contractions. There was a significant reduction in in vitro maximum 
Ca2+-activated force in skinned fibers in gastrocnemius muscle from AIA rats. 
These changes were associated with reduced expression levels of contractile 
proteins (i.e., myosin and actin), increased levels of inflammation redox 
stress-related biomarkers (i.e., TNF-α, malondialdehyde-protein adducts, NADPH 
oxidase 2, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase), and autolyzed active calpain-1 
in AIA muscles. ECC training markedly enhanced the steady-state levels of 
αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein, and its binding to the myofibrils and 
prevented the AIA-induced myofibrillar dysfunction, reduction in contractile 
proteins, and inflammation-oxidative stress insults. Our findings demonstrate 
that ECC training preserves myofibrillar function without muscle damage in AIA 
rats, which is at least partially attributable to the protective effect of 
αB-crystallin on the myofibrils against oxidative stress-mediated protein 
degeneration. Thus ECC training can be a safe and effective intervention, 
counteracting the loss of muscle strength in RA patients. NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
Eccentric contractions (ECCs) are regarded as an effective way to increase 
muscle strength. No studies, however, assess safety and effectiveness of ECC 
training on muscle weakness associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we used 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats to demonstrate that ECC training prevents 
intrinsic contractile dysfunction without muscle damage in AIA rats, which may 
be attributed to the protective effect of αB-crystallin on the myofibrils 
against inflammation-oxidative stress insults.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of the fractalkine (FKN)/CX3 CR1 pathway in 
joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: We examined the effect of treatment with anti-mouse FKN (anti-mFKN) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) on joint destruction and the migration of osteoclast 
precursors (OCPs) into the joint, using the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
model. DBA/1 mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen to induce 
arthritis, and then treated with anti-mFKN mAb. Disease severity was monitored 
by arthritis score, and joint destruction was evaluated by soft x-ray and 
histologic analyses. Plasma levels of joint destruction markers were assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FKN expression on endothelial cells was 
detected by immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow-derived OCPs were labeled with 
fluorescein and transferred to mice with CIA, and the migration of the OCPs to 
the joints was then analyzed.
RESULTS: Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with anti-mFKN mAb 
significantly decreased the arthritis and soft x-ray scores. Plasma levels of 
cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and matrix metalloproteinase 3 decreased 
after treatment with anti-mFKN mAb. Histologic analysis revealed that anti-mFKN 
mAb inhibited synovitis, pannus formation, and cartilage destruction, as well as 
suppressed bone damage, with a marked reduction in the number of 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts. Anti-mFKN mAb strongly 
inhibited the migration of bone marrow-derived OCPs into the affected synovium.
CONCLUSION: Anti-mFKN mAb notably ameliorates arthritis and joint destruction in 
the CIA model, as well as inhibits migration of OCPs into the synovium. These 
results suggest that inhibition of the FKN/CX3 CR1 pathway could be a novel 
strategy for treatment of both synovitis and joint destruction in rheumatoid 
arthritis.

BACKGROUND: The discovery and development of new medicines requires 
high-throughput screening of possible therapeutics in a specific model of the 
disease. Infrared thermal imaging (IRT) is a modern assessment method with 
extensive clinical and preclinical applications. Employing IRT in longitudinal 
preclinical setting to monitor arthritis onset, disease activity and therapeutic 
efficacies requires a standardized framework to provide reproducible 
quantitative data as a precondition for clinical studies.
METHODS: Here, we established the accuracy and reliability of an inexpensive 
smartphone connected infrared (IR) camera against known temperature objects as 
well as certified blackbody calibration equipment. An easy to use protocol 
incorporating contactless image acquisition and computer-assisted data analysis 
was developed to detect disease-related temperature changes in a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model and validated by comparison with 
two conventional methods, clinical arthritis scoring and paw thickness 
measurement. We implemented IRT to demonstrate the beneficial therapeutic effect 
of nanoparticle drug delivery versus free methotrexate (MTX) in vivo.
RESULTS: The calibrations revealed high accuracy and reliability of the IR 
camera for detecting temperature changes in the rheumatoid arthritis animal 
model. Significant positive correlation was found between temperature changes 
and paw thickness measurements as the disease progressed. IRT was found to be 
superior over the conventional techniques specially at early arthritis onset, 
when it is difficult to observe subclinical signs and measure structural 
changes.
CONCLUSION: IRT proved to be a valid and unbiased method to detect temperature 
changes and quantify the degree of inflammation in a rapid and reproducible 
manner in longitudinal preclinical drug efficacy studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro and in vivo antiarthritic potential of Solanum 
nigrum (S. nigrum).
METHODS: Aqueous methanolic (70∶30) extract of S. nigrum was prepared. The in 
vitro antiarthritic effect was evaluated in terms of its inhibition of protein 
denaturation and membrane stabilization. While, formaldehyde, complete Freund's 
adjuvant (CFA) and Collagen induced arthritis rat models were used to study in 
vivo antiarthritic activities of S. nigrum at dose level of 200, 400 and 800 
mg/kg.
RESULTS: The extract exhibited inhibition of protein denaturation and protected 
red blood cell by stabilizing the membranes in a concentration dependent manner, 
with maximum effect attained at 800 μg/mL. Moreover, there was a marked 
reduction in paw edema observed in extract treated animals, when compared to 
arthritic control animals in all in vivo models and 800 mg/kg dose got maximum 
reduction of paw edema. In CFA and collagen models, plant extract restored body 
weight, hematologic parameters, radiographic and histopathologic alterations 
towards normal.
CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that S. nigrum holds antiarthritic potential, 
supporting its traditional use in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) functions in NAD synthesis, 
apoptosis, and inflammation. Dysregulation of NAMPT has been associated with 
several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose 
of this study was to investigate NAMPT's role in arthritis using mouse and 
cellular models. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J Nampt +/- mice was 
evaluated by ELISA, micro-CT, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). In vitro Nampt 
loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies on osteoclastogenesis were 
examined by TRAP staining, nascent RNA capture, luciferase reporter assays, and 
ChIP-PCR. Nampt-deficient mice presented with suppressed inflammatory bone 
destruction and disease progression in a CIA mouse model. Nampt expression was 
required for the epigenetic regulation of the Nfatc1 promoter and 
osteoclastogenesis. Finally, RNA-seq identified 690 differentially expressed 
genes in whole ankle joints which associated (P < 0.05) with Nampt expression 
and CIA. Selected target was validated by RT-PCR or functional characterization. 
We have provided evidence that NAMPT functions as a genetic risk factor and a 
potential therapeutic target to RA.

BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of adoptive infusion of specific 
thymus-derived invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in a mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was observed, and the mechanism of cellular 
immunotherapy was preliminarily explored.
METHODS: Thymus-derived iNKT cells were infused to RA model mice, with α-GalCer 
as a positive control. Then, ankle swelling was examined, as well as 
inflammatory cell infiltration to the joint tissue (hematoxylin-eosin [H&E] 
staining). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assess iNKT cell and helper T 
lymphocyte (Th) subsets. Serum cytokine levels were determined with cytometric 
bead array (CBA), with protein expression levels of related transcription 
factors assessed by Western blot.
RESULTS: The joint swelling in RA model animals were significantly improved in 
the cell therapy and α-GalCer positive control groups (P < 0.05). In addition, 
iNKT frequencies in peripheral blood, the thymus and spleen were increased 
significantly (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, iNKT1 subset frequencies in the thymus and 
spleen were decreased, as well as splenic Th1 and Th17 cell subset rates, and 
serum TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 levels. The rates of iNKT2 and Th2 subsets as well 
as IL-4 and IL-10 levels were increased (P < 0.05). Thymus GATA-3 and splenic 
PLZF protein levels were increased (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Adoptive infusion of thymus-derived iNKT cells exerts therapeutic 
effects in RA mice by increasing iNKT frequency, altering the proportions of 
iNKT cell subsets, correcting Th cell subset imbalance and reducing the amounts 
of inflammatory cytokines.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive disease, it often involves 
kidney, lung, heart, and other systems.Renal damage is quite common in RA. 
Exploring of biomarkers of renal damage in the course of RA progression is of 
significant importance for disease diagnosis and treatment. We use type II 
Collagen-Induced Arthritis(CIA) Model. Serums were collected at the 4th, 6th, 
8th, and 10th week after the first immunization. An untargeted metabonomic 
strategy based on UPLC-Q/TOF/MS with support vector machine(SVM) was developed 
to discover the biomarkers in the rats' serum samples between the RA stage(4-6 
weeks in RA model, at which time the kidneys are not affected) and renal damage 
in RA stage(8-10 weeks in RA model, and the kidneys are affected). Principal 
component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant 
analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyze the metabolic profiles of rat serum. The 
support vector machine (SVM) method was used to screen the specific markers of 
renal damage in RA. Following multivariate statistical and integration analysis, 
5 specific markers of renal damage in RA were screened and found. After the 
analysis of these metabolites, pentose and glucuronate interconversions are 
closely related to the pathogenesis of RA renal damage. The present study first 
use untargeted dmetabonomics combined with the pathological features in the 
different phases of CIA model rats. This will provide a basis for the choice of 
treatment drugs for patients with RA who may be complicated by renal damage.

specializes in treatment of upper limb rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the exact 
mechanism is unclear. P2Xs are useful targets for inflammatory pain therapy. It 
led us to hypothesize that NI may preferentially act on particular P2Xs and 
these receptors may be unevenly distributed in the upper/lower limb.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate P2Xs distribution in the upper/lower limb and NI's 
targets in upper limb RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SD rats were randomized into 11 groups of 10 animals 
each. Eight experimental groups were established by the injection of 0.1 mL FCA 
into the plantar surface of rat paw. Three control groups suffered the same 
volume of saline. The articular cavities were then taken on the seventh day to 
detect P2Xs expression. NI (3 g/kg) and prednisone (10 mg/kg) were respectively 
given by oral gavage once daily for 14 d. The swelling degree and P2Xs were 
evaluated individually.
RESULTS: In normal rats, the expressions of P2X3 and P2X6 in forelimb were 
markedly higher than that of in hind limb (P < 0.05). After induced by FCA, 
P2X1, P2X3, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 were increased significantly (P < 0.01). The 
biggest difference was P2X3. In NI treatment rats, swelling degree of the 
7th/14th day in forelimb was 68.24%/38.89%, whereas that of in hind limb was 
88.72%/79.92%. P2X3 mRNA and protein expression was significantly reduced as 
contrasted with the control group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: P2X3 receptor was predominantly expressed in the forelimb RA rat. 
NI relieved the FCA-induced RA by inhibiting upper limb's P2X3 receptor.

BACKGROUND: Since HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) occur in up to 
half of HIV-positive individuals, even with combined antiretroviral therapy 
(cART), adjunctive therapies are needed. Chronic CNS inflammation contributes to 
HAND and HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Baricitinib is a JAK 1/2 inhibitor approved in 
the USA, EU, and Japan for rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating potent inhibition 
of IL-6, D-dimer, CRP, TNF-α, IFN-α/β, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines.
METHODS: Our modified murine HAND model was used to evaluate the ability of 
baricitinib to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and modulate 
monocyte/macrophage-driven HAND. Severity of HAND was measured by assessing 
cognitive performance of low- and high-dose baricitinib treated versus untreated 
HAND mice. The severity of brain neuroinflammation was evaluated in these mouse 
groups after flow cytometric analyses. We also assessed the ability of 
baricitinib to block events in myeloid and lymphoid cells in vitro that may 
undergird the persistence of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS) in primary 
human macrophages (Mϕ) and lymphocytes including HIV replication, HIV-induced 
activation, reservoir expansion, and reservoir maintenance.
RESULTS: In vivo, both doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg qd baricitinib crossed the BBB 
and reversed behavioral abnormalities conferred by HIV infection. Moreover, 
baricitinib significantly reduced HIV-induced neuroinflammation marked by glial 
activation: activated microglia (MHCII+/CD45+) and astrogliosis (GFAP). 
Baricitinib also significantly reduced the percentage of p24+ human macrophages 
in mouse brains (p < 0.05 versus HAND mice; t test). In vitro, baricitinib 
significantly reduced markers of persistence, reservoir size, and reseeding in 
Mϕ.
CONCLUSION: These results show that blocking the JAK/STAT pathway reverses 
cognitive deficits and curtails inflammatory markers in HAND in mice. Our group 
recently reported safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-infected 
individuals (Marconi et al., Safety, tolerability and immunologic activity of 
ruxolitinib added to suppressive ART, 2019), underscoring potential safety and 
utility of JAK inhibitors for additional human trials. The data reported herein 
coupled with our recent human trial with JAK inhibitors provide compelling 
preclinical data and impetus for considering a trial of baricitinib in HAND 
individuals treated with cART to reverse cognitive deficits and key events 
driving viral persistence.

Accumulating evidence suggests long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles 
in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we aimed to define the 
role of HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) in RA pathogenesis in 
relation to SFRP1 methylation and Wnt signaling pathway. HOTTIP was found highly 
expressed, and SFRP1 was hypermethylated in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). 
Next, gain- or loss-of-function experiments were conducted in RASFs to explore 
the effects of HOTTIP on the biological behaviors of RASFs. Silencing of HOTTIP 
or overexpression of SFRP1 inhibited RASF proliferation, invasion, and 
migration, while enhancing apoptosis. The relationship among HOTTIP, SFRP1, and 
Dnmt3b was determined using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), bisulfite sequencing 
PCR (BSP), RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The regulatory mechanisms of 
HOTTIP/Dnmt3b/SFRP1 were explored by altering their expression in RASFs. It was 
noted that HOTTIP could induce SFRP1 promoter methylation through recruitment of 
Dnmt3b and activate the Wnt signaling pathway. Finally, a rat RA model was 
established in order to evaluate the in vivo effects of HOTTIP and SFRP1, which 
suggested that HOTTIP silencing or SFRP1 elevation inhibited the progression of 
RA in vivo. Our key findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory ability of HOTTIP 
silencing in RA through SFRP1 promoter demethylation. These findings support 
HOTTIP as a candidate anti-arthritis target.

The present study aimed to explore miR-125 effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
development to provide a potential target for RA. Briefly, rat RA model was 
established (Model group) by injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant into the 
left hind toe. Normal rats injected with saline in the same location were set as 
Normal group. All rats' secondary foot swelling degree, polyarthritis index 
score, spleen and thymus index were measured. Synovial tissues were subjected to 
Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. Synovial cells of each 
group were isolated and named as Normal-C group and Model-C group, respectively. 
Synovial cells of Model-C group further underwent cotransfection with miR-125 
mimics and PARP2-siRNA (mimics+siPARP2 group) or with miR-125 negative control 
(NC) and PARP2-siRNA NC (NC group). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR 
(qRT-PCR), Western blot, luciferase reporter assay, ELISA, and MTT assay were 
performed. As a result, compared with Normal group, rats of Model group showed 
significantly higher secondary foot swelling degree, polyarthritis index score, 
spleen and thymus index (P<0.01). Down-regulated miR-125 and up-regulated PARP2 
was found in synovial tissues of Model group when compared with Normal group 
(P<0.01). Synovial tissues of Model-C group exhibited severe hyperplasia and 
inflammatory cell infiltration. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that PARP2 
was directly inhibited by miR-125. Compared with NC group, cells of 
mimics+siPARP2 group had significantly lower IL-1β, MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels, 
absorbance value, and p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR relative expression (P<0.01 or 
P<0.05). Thus, miR-125 might attenuate RA development by regulating 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway via directly inhibiting PARP2 expression.

This investigation reports a novel nanoGold-core multifunctional dendrimer for 
pulsatile chemo-, photothermal- and photodynamic- therapy of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Architecturally, the nanocomposites comprised of a nanoGold (Au) 
at the focal whose surface is functionalized by hydroxy-terminated 
thiolated-dendrons following Au-thiol bond formation to produce nanoGold-core 
multifunctional dendrimer (Au-DEN). The surface hydroxyl groups of Au-DEN were 
then conjugated with methotrexate (MTX; a disease-modifying first line 
anti-rheumatic drug; DMARD; 74.29 ± 0.48% loading) to form Au-DEN-MTX-NPs 
(Particle size: 100.15 ± 28.36 nm; poly dispersibility index, PDI: 0.39 ± 0.02; 
surface zeta potential, ζ: -22.45 ± 1.06 mV). MTX was strategically selected to 
serve as an anti-rheumatic DMARD as well as a targeting ligand to attain 
selective localization of the formulation in arthritic tissue via folate 
receptors upregulated on arthritic tissues. The docking study was performed to 
confirm the viable binding efficiency of MTX towards β-folate receptors that are 
overexpressed on arthritic tissues taking folic acid as a reference standard. 
The IR780, a NIR active bioactive was also loaded in Au-DEN-MTX NPs to offer 
photothermal benefit upon irradiation with NIR laser (wavelength: 808 nm). The 
hypothesis was tested by elucidation of in vitro drug release profile, 
photothermal activity, cellular uptake (Fluorescence and confocal laser scanning 
microscopy; CLSM), cell viability assay (MTT protocol) and Intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the hemolytic 
toxicity and stability studies were also investigated to determine the blood 
compatibility as well as ideal storage condition of NPs. The outcome of this 
investigations presents developed multifunctional targeted NPs to be potential 
therapeutics for the improved treatment of RA. The approach can also be applied 
to other clinical interventions involving countering inflammatory conditions.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The cause of autoimmune diseases remains incompletely 
understood. Here, we highlight recent advances in the role of proinflammatory 
metabolic pathways in autoimmune disease, including treatment with antioxidants 
and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies show that mTOR pathway activation, glucose 
utilization, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and antioxidant defenses 
play critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including 
rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytopenia, Sjögren's syndrome, large vessel 
vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. mTOR activity leads to Th1 and 
Th17 cell proliferation, Treg depletion, plasma cell differentiation, macrophage 
dysfunction, and increased antibody and immune complex production, ultimately 
resulting in tissue inflammation. mTOR also affects the function of connective 
tissue cells, including fibroblast-like synoviocytes, endothelial cells, and 
podocytes. mTOR inhibition via rapamycin and N-acetylcysteine, and blockade of 
glucose utilization show clinical efficacy in both mouse models and clinical 
trials, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
SUMMARY: The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of growth and survival signals, 
integrating environmental cues to control cell proliferation and 
differentiation. Activation of mTOR underlies inflammatory lineage 
specification, and mTOR blockade-based therapies show promising efficacy in 
several autoimmune diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a poor prognosis. Pyroptosis 
is a type of proinflammatory programmed cell death that is characterised by the 
activation of caspase-1 and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines 
interleukin (IL)-1β/18. Previous reports have shown that pyroptosis is closely 
related to the development of some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis. The decrease in the pH of joint fluid is a main pathogenic feature of 
RA and leads to excessive apoptosis in chondrocytes. Acid-sensitive ion channels 
(ASICs) are extracellular H+-activated cation channels that mainly influence Na+ 
and Ca2+ permeability. In this study, we investigated the role of Ca2+ in 
acid-sensing ion channel 1a-mediated chondrocyte pyroptosis in an adjuvant 
arthritis rat model. The expression of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, 
NLRP3, caspase-1, ASIC 1a, IL-1β and IL-18 was upregulated in the joints of rats 
compared with that in normal rats, but the expression of Col2a in cartilage was 
decreased. However, these changes were reversed by amiloride, which is an 
inhibitor of ASIC1a. Extracellular acidosis significantly increased the 
expression of ASIC1a, IL-1β, IL-18, ASC, NLRP3 and caspase-1 and promoted the 
release of lactate dehydrogenase. Interestingly, Psalmotoxin-1 (Pctx-1) and 
BAPTA-AM inhibited these effects. These results indicate that ASIC1a mediates 
pyroptosis in chondrocytes from AA rats. The underlying mechanism may be 
associated with the ability of ASIC1a to promote [Ca2+]i and upregulate the 
expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Under conditions of cellular stress, proteins can be post-translationally 
modified causing them to be recognized by the immune system. One such 
stress-induced post-translational modification (siPTM) is citrullination, the 
conversion of arginine residues to citrulline by peptidylarginine deiminase 
(PAD) enzymes. PAD enzymes are activated by millimolar concentrations of calcium 
which can occur during apoptosis, leading to precipitation of proteins, their 
subsequent uptake by B cells and stimulation of antibody responses. Detection of 
anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) is a diagnostic of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), where immune complexes stimulate inflammation around the joints. 
More recently, autophagy has been shown to play a role in the presentation of 
citrullinated peptides on MHC class II molecules to CD4+ helper T cells, 
suggesting that citrullination may be a way of alerting immune cells to cellular 
stress. Additionally, inflammation-induced IFNγ and concomitant MHC class II 
expression on target cells contributes to immune activation. Stressful 
conditions in the tumor microenvironment induce autophagy in cancer cells as a 
pro-survival mechanism. Cancer cells also over express PAD enzymes and in light 
of this the hypothesis that citrullinated peptides stimulate CD4+ T cell 
responses that would recognize these siPTM's produced during autophagy has been 
investigated. The induction of potent citrullinated peptide-specific CD4 
responses has been shown in both humans and HLA transgenic mouse models. 
Responses in mouse models resulted in potent anti-tumour responses against 
tumours expressing either constitutive or IFNγ-inducible MHC class II. The 
anti-tumour effect relied upon direct recognition of tumours by specific CD4 T 
cells suggesting that citrullinated peptides are attractive targets for cancer 
vaccines.

Gelsemium elegans Benth. is a toxic plant that has been used as an ancient 
Chinese herbal remedy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and nervous pain, 
spasticity, skin ulcers, and cancers. Koumine, one of its representative 
alkaloids, shows numerous promising pharmacological activities, including 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Here, we investigated the analgesic 
effect of koumine on the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model of RA and 
explored the potential pharmacological mechanisms underlying the analgesia. In 
the CIA rats, repeated koumine treatments significantly reduced pain compared to 
controls and attenuated the collagen-induced increase in levels of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour 
necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Cultured astrocytes showed 
reduced astrocyte reactivation and decreased production of both tested 
cytokines. Based on our results, koumine exerted both analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory effects on the CIA rat model that were apparently mediated by 
inhibiting astrocyte reactivation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

The cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A are elevated in a variety of autoimmune diseases, 
including rheumatoid arthritis. Both cytokines are targets of several biologic 
drugs used in the clinic, but unfortunately many patients are refractory to 
these therapies. IL-17A and TNF-α are known to mediate signaling synergistically 
to drive expression of inflammatory genes. Hence, combined blockade of TNF-α and 
IL-17A represents an attractive treatment strategy in autoimmune settings where 
monotherapy is not fully effective. However, a major concern with this approach 
is the potential predisposition to opportunistic infections that might outweigh 
any clinical benefits. Accordingly, we examined the impact of individual versus 
combined neutralization of TNF-α and IL-17A in a mouse model of rheumatoid 
arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis) and the concomitant susceptibility to 
infections that are likely to manifest as side effects of blocking these 
cytokines (oral candidiasis or tuberculosis). Our findings indicate that 
combined neutralization of TNF-α and IL-17A was considerably more effective than 
monotherapy in improving collagen-induced arthritis disease even when 
administered at a minimally efficacious dose. Encouragingly, however, dual 
cytokine blockade did not cooperatively impair antimicrobial host defenses, as 
mice given combined IL-17A and TNF-α neutralization displayed infectious 
profiles and humoral responses comparable to mice given high doses of individual 
anti-TNF-α or anti-IL-17A mAbs. These data support the idea that combined 
neutralization of TNF-α and IL-17A for refractory autoimmunity is likely to be 
associated with acceptable and manageable risks of opportunistic infections 
associated with these cytokines.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common rheumatic 
diseases. Joint inflammation and pathological growth of joint cartilage cause 
swollen and painful joints, which severely diminishes the patients' life 
quality. There is no causal treatment. Symptomatic therapies should start as 
early as possible to take maximal effect. Hence, diagnostic procedures capable 
of detecting affected joints before the onset of clinical symptoms are highly 
desirable. We explored the value of PET imaging of integrin subtypes αvβ3 and 
α5β1 for early detection of RA foci in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse 
models.
RESULTS: Development of RA in CIA mice was monitored by paw scoring, and αvβ3- 
and α5β1-integrin expression was quantified by μPET using 68Ga-Avebetrin and 
68Ga-Aquibeprin. For consecutive sections of selected decalcified joints (knee, 
ankle), arthritic degeneration and integrin expression were assessed by MOVAT 
staining and β3/α5 immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. β3- and α5-IHC 
revealed elevated levels of both αvβ3- and α5β1-integrin in arthritic joints. 
Unlike αvβ3, α5β1 is strongly expressed in the proliferating synovial lining 
layer, which suggests that its presence is directly related to RA development. 
For mice with advanced RA (6 weeks after CIA), PET signals for α5β1-integrin 
were substantially stronger (> 300% of baseline) than that of αvβ3-integrin 
(< 200%). A longitudinal PET follow-up revealed that the manifestation of 
clinical symptoms of RA is preceded by upregulation of α5β1- but not of 
αvβ3-integrin.
CONCLUSION: α5β1-integrin PET could add a new functional imaging aspect to the 
portfolio of RA diagnostics because it appears to be a sensitive biomarker for 
early RA development. We suggest α5β1-integrin PET as a valuable tool to achieve 
a higher precision for early diagnosis of RA, including initial staging, 
monitoring of the disease course, and drug treatment, and for planning of 
radiosynoviorthesis (RSO).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The whole plant of Glycine tabacina (Labill.) 
Benth has been used as a traditional herbal medicine to treat rheumatism, 
ostealgia and nephritis in China. It is also one of the sources of the renowned 
native herbal medicine 'I-Tiao-Gung' in Taiwan.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the anti-arthritic effect of 
ethanol extract of G. tabacina (GTE) in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat 
model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical profile of GTE was analyzed by HPLC-UV. The 
CIA was induced in male Wistar rats by intradermal injection of bovine type II 
collagen at tail root, back and ankle joints. The rats were orally administrated 
daily with GTE (1.11, 2.22 and 4.44 g dry weight of herb powder per kg body 
weight) from day 0 and continued for 30 days. Swelling volume and thickness of 
paw, arthritis index, X-radiographs and histopathological changes were examined 
to assess the severity of arthritis. Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, such as interleukin1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity and malonaldehyde (MDA) 
level were measured to preliminarily explore the possible mechanisms.
RESULTS: Oral administration of GTE significantly ameliorated the arthritic 
symptoms in CIA rat model, as indicated by the effects on paws swelling and 
arthritis index. X-radiographic analysis and histopathological examinations 
demonstrated that GTE effectively protected the bone and cartilage of joints 
from erosion, lesion and deformation. The efficacy of GTE treatment on CIA was 
comparable to that of indomethacin (positive drug). Besides, the overproduction 
of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was remarkably inhibited in the serum of all GTE 
treatment groups. The restoration of serum T-SOD activity and MDA level proved 
that GTE administration alleviated the oxidative stress in CIA rats.
CONCLUSIONS: GTE exhibited strong anti-CIA activity through inhibiting 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidation in rats, suggesting its potential 
preventive and therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease, 
although its immune mechanism has not been fully studied. In this study, healthy 
controls (HC), osteoarthritis patients (OA), and RA patients were enrolled, and 
mice were evenly divided into control, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), PD-1 
Fc/CIA (PD-1 Fc membrane fusion protein administered to CIA mice), OX40 Fc/CIA 
(OX40 Fc membrane fusion protein administered to CIA mice), and PD-1 Fc + OX40 
Fc/CIA groups. The expressions of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and OX40 in CD4+ T 
lymphocytes and the levels of sPD-1, immunoglobulin, and proinflammatory factors 
in patients and mice were measured. The results showed that the expression 
levels of PD-1 and OX40 in CD4+ T lymphocytes separated from the peripheral 
blood and synovial fluid of RA patients and the spleen of CIA mice were 
observably elevated. The levels of soluble PD-1, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, 
IL-17, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in RA patients obviously increased. In animal 
experiments, PD-1 Fc not only increased the serum levels of immunoglobulin G 
(IgG), IgG1, and IgG2a in CIA mice, but also increased the levels of IL-4, IL-2, 
IL-5, IL-17, and IFN-γ in mouse spleen cells and joint tissues, which, however, 
were reversed by OX40 Fc. In conclusion, OX40 inhibition could reverse the 
progression of RA caused by PD-1 blocking, and PD-1 might be a potential target 
for RA. Clinical Trials.gov ID: HGH2018012203.

How pathogenic cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) develop remains poorly understood. We used Nur77-a marker of T 
cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling-to identify antigen-activated CD4 T cells 
in the SKG mouse model of autoimmune arthritis and in patients with RA. Using a 
fluorescent reporter of Nur77 expression in SKG mice, we found that higher 
levels of Nur77-eGFP in SKG CD4 T cells marked their autoreactivity, 
arthritogenic potential, and ability to more readily differentiate into 
interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing cells. The T cells with increased 
autoreactivity, nonetheless had diminished ex vivo inducible TCR signaling, 
perhaps reflective of adaptive inhibitory mechanisms induced by chronic 
autoantigen exposure in vivo. The enhanced autoreactivity was associated with 
up-regulation of IL-6 cytokine signaling machinery, which might be attributable, 
in part, to a reduced amount of expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 
(SOCS3)-a key negative regulator of IL-6 signaling. As a result, the more 
autoreactive GFPhi CD4 T cells from SKGNur mice were hyperresponsive to IL-6 
receptor signaling. Consistent with findings from SKGNur mice, SOCS3 expression 
was similarly down-regulated in RA synovium. This suggests that despite impaired 
TCR signaling, autoreactive T cells exposed to chronic antigen stimulation 
exhibit heightened sensitivity to IL-6, which contributes to the 
arthritogenicity in SKG mice, and perhaps in patients with RA.

Human cathelicidin LL37 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide active against 
bacteria and viruses and exerting immune modulatory functions. LL37 can be also 
a target of autoreactive B- and T-lymphocytes in autoimmune settings. 
Irreversible post-translational modifications, such as citrullination and 
carbamylation, mainly occurring at the level of cationic amino acids arginine 
and lysine, can affect the inflammatory properties and reduce antibacterial 
effects. Moreover, these modifications could be implicated in the rupture of 
immune tolerance to LL37 in chronic conditions such as psoriatic disease and 
cutaneous lupus (LE)/systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we describe the 
generation and fine specificity of six recombinant antibodies (MRB137-MRB142), 
produced as a monovalent mouse antibody with the antigen-binding scFv portion 
fused to a mouse IgG2a Fc, and their ability to recognize either native or 
citrullinated LL37 (cit-LL37) and not cross-react to carbamylated LL37. By using 
these antibodies, we detected native LL37 or cit-LL37 in SLE and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) sera, and in LE skin, by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, 
respectively. Such antibodies represent previously unavailable and useful tools 
to address relationships between the presence of post-translational modified 
LL37 and the immune system status (in terms of innate/adaptive responses 
activation) and the clinical characteristics of patients affected by chronic 
immune-mediated diseases or infectious diseases.

(1) Background: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes 
progressive articular damage and functional loss. It is characterized by 
synovial inflammation that leads to progressive cartilage destruction. For this 
reason, research on functional foods that reduce the inflammatory response are 
under progress. (2) Methods: We focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of 
Sargassum muticum, and confirmed the effect of the extract on the 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) DBA/1J mice model. (3) Results: The extract was 
given at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, and the arthritis score and 
edema volume of the experimental group were significantly different from the CIA 
group. The level of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and 
interferon (IFN)-γ were determined in serum and lymphocytes. The expression of 
these cytokines in the serum remarkably decreased from S. muticum extract 
(SME)100 mg/kg, and decreased from SME 200 mg/kg in lymphocytes. Also, 
immunohistochemical analysis of IL-6 and TNF-α in the joints revealed that the 
inflammatory response was noticeably lower when treated with S. muticum extract. 
(4) Conclusions: This study provides results of the experiment of S. muticum 
extract treatment in a mouse model. The treatment was found to contribute to the 
alleviation of edema and symptoms by reducing the expression of inflammatory 
cytokines. It was concluded that it may be a useful substance to help in the 
mitigation of arthritis symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the efficacy and mechanism by which NTX 
alleviate arthritis in CIA rat models in vivo.
METHODS: Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, their weights 
were observed and the severity of arthritis and pathological changes were 
evaluated by HE staining. T lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry. 
The expression of cytokines was detected in peripheral serum by ELISA. Real time 
PCR, immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis were utilized to 
detect the mRNA and protein expression of opioid receptors, TLR4, RANKL and 
/NF-κB in synovial tissue and the spleen.
RESULTS: The weight of the rats in the 10 mg/kg NTX group decreased the least, 
and had the least severe arthritis. CD4+ T cells, Th1 cells and Treg cells 
increased, and CD8+T cells, Th1 cells and Th17 cells decreased in the splenic 
lymphocytes. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines decreased, and the 
expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines increased. MOR and DOR were strongly 
expressed in the spleen, whereas KOR and DOR were strongly expressed in synovial 
tissue. The expression of TLR4, NF-κB and RANKL was reduced in the spleen and 
synovium in the NTX group.
CONCLUSIONS: NTX relieved the severity of arthritis in the CIA rat models at a 
concentration of 10 mg/kg by regulating T lymphocyte subsets and the expression 
of cytokines. NTX affected opioid receptors to inhibit the TLR4/NF-κB signaling 
pathway, regulating the systemic immune response and decreasing osteoclast 
differentiation, thereby alleviating inflammation and the erosion of articular 
cartilage along with bone tissue.

Protein arginine deiminases (PADs) hydrolyze the side chain of arginine to form 
citrulline. Aberrant PAD activity is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, 
multiple sclerosis, lupus, and certain cancers. These pathologies established 
the PADs as therapeutic targets and multiple PAD inhibitors are known. Herein, 
we describe the first highly potent PAD1-selective inhibitors (1 and 19). 
Detailed structure-activity relationships indicate that their potency and 
selectivity is due to the formation of a halogen bond with PAD1. Importantly, 
these inhibitors inhibit histone H3 citrullination in HEK293TPAD1 cells and 
mouse zygotes with excellent potency. Based on this scaffold, we also developed 
a PAD1-selective activity-based probe that shows remarkable cellular efficacy 
and proteome selectivity. Based on their potency and selectivity we expect that 
1 and 19 will be widely used chemical tools to understand PAD1 biology.

To compare human adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) and etanercept 
as immunomodulatory agents for collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA was induced 
by rats' immunization with collagen type II (CII) in complete Freund's adjuvant 
in days 0 and 7. Before the onset of CIA, prevention group received five doses 
of AT-MSCS intraperitoneally. After establishment of arthritis, rats received 
either five doses of AT-MSCs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
intraperitoneally or six doses of etanercept subcutaneously. Clinical and 
histopathological evaluation were performed in all groups; serum levels of tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and anti-collagen II were 
assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total percent of 
autoreactive T and regulatory T (Treg) cells were quantified using spleen immune 
histochemical analysis. AT-MSCs were able to delay the onset of CIA, suppress 
the ongoing clinical and histopathological signs, decrease serum levels of TNF-α 
and anti-collagen type II, and downregulate the autoreactive T cells as 
etanercept. AT-MSCs were more potent in Treg cells upregulation, producing high 
serum levels of IL10. AT-MSCs might have a therapeutic effect in CIA via their 
potency in immune cell education, representing an effective new promising 
approach in rheumatoid arthritis in human.

Animal models are in constant development to benefit scientific research. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered a very complex disease due to its 
complicated pathogenesis, and patients with rheumatic disease around the world 
are still unable to obtain effective, simple and curable treatment. In order to 
obtain a clear insight into the pathogenesis of RA, a rat model was established 
based on the concept of Bi syndrome in Traditional Chinese Medicine by 
simulating the conditions of RA as much as possible via the change in the 
physical conditions wind, damp, cold and heat (WDCH). For the first time, a new 
WDCH-induced RA model in female rats was successfully established and evaluated 
by body-weight change, paw swelling, blood cells analysis, spleen and thymus 
coefficients, autoantibodies and serum cytokine changes and histopathology. This 
model is characterised by its objectivity, no exogenous induction, short 
modelling time, extremely elevated expression level of autoantibodies and 
obvious histopathological change. The establishment of such a new model may 
provide more benefits in the research of the pathogenesis of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease that primarily 
manifests as persistent synovitis and progressive joint destruction. Imatinib 
exhibited a therapeutic effect in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) via 
selective inhibition tyrosine kinases. The second-generation tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor dasatinib exhibits more durable hematological and cytogenetic effects 
and more potency compared to imatinib. However, the effect of dasatinib on CIA 
is poorly understood. The present study investigated the treatment effect of 
dasatinib on autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated that dasatinib alleviated 
arthritis symptoms and histopathological destruction in CIA mice. Dasatinib 
treatment inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, 
TNF-α, and IL-6, and promoted the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-10. Dasatinib treatment also suppressed the expression of anti-mouse CII 
antibodies including total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG2b, in CIA mice. We further 
demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited the migration and proliferation of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA patients and promoted FLS apoptosis. 
The mRNA expression of MMP13, VEGF, FGF, and DKK1 was down-regulated in FLS 
treated with dasatinib. Our findings suggest that dasatinib exhibited treatment 
effects on CIA mice and that FLS are an important target cell of dasatinib 
treatment in autoimmune arthritis.

Sinomenine (SIN) is an isoquinoline derived from Caulis Sinomenii that has been 
used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis for several decades in 
China. This study aims to reveal the effects of SIN on mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 
cells growth and inflammation. SIN was used to treat ATDC5 cells injured by 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The following parameters were determined for 
evaluating the treatment effects of SIN: cell viability, apoptosis, reactive 
oxygen species generation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Besides, the 
expression of LPS-sensitive miRNA (miR-192) and the activation of NF-κB and MAPK 
signaling were studied to explain SIN's function. SIN with concentration of 
30 μM significantly attenuated LPS-induced cell damage via increasing cell 
viability, inhibiting apoptosis and reactive oxygen species generation, and 
declining IL-6 and TNF-α release. miR-192 was downregulated by SIN treatment. 
Restoration of miR-192 expression by miRNA transfection could significantly 
impede SIN's protective action. Besides, the inhibitory effects of SIN on the 
activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling were attenuated by miR-192 
overexpression. Furthermore, GDF11 was found to be a target gene of miR-192. 
LPS-mediated injury to chondrogenic ATDC5 cells can be relieved by SIN via 
downregulating miR-192 and subsequently repressing the activation of NF-κB and 
MAPK signaling.

Objectives: To explore the molecular mechanisms in which vitamin D (VD) 
regulates T cells, especially Th17 cells in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
Methods: DBA1/J mice induced for CIA were intraperitoneally treated with VD. CIA 
clinical symptoms and inflammatory responses including Th1/Th17/Tregs 
percentages were determined and compared. Mouse naïve CD4+ T cells transduced 
with miR-124 inhibitor or not were polarized to Th17 cells with or without VD. 
Subsequently, cellular differentiation and IL-6 signaling moleculars were 
analyzed. Results: VD treatment significantly delayed CIA onset, decreased 
incidence and clinical scores of arthritis, downregulated serum IgG levels and 
ameliorated bone erosion. VD downregulated IL-17A production in CD4+ T cells 
while increased CD4+Foxp3+Nrp-1+ cells both in draining lymph nodes and synovial 
fluid in arthritic mice. VD inhibited Th17 cells differentiation in vivo and in 
vitro and potentially functioning directly on T cells to restrain Th17 cells 
through limiting IL-6R expression and its downstream signaling including STAT3 
phosphorylation, while these effects were blocked when naïve CD4+ T cells were 
transduced with miR-124 inhibitor. Conclusions: VD treatment ameliorates CIA via 
suppression of Th17 cells and enhancement of Tregs. miR-124-mediated inhibition 
of IL-6 signaling, provides a novel explanation for VD's role on T cells in CIA 
mice or RA patients and suggests that VD may have treatment implications in 
rheumatoid arthritis.

The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine, has shown therapeutic effect in 
rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, the current study aims at determining 
the mode of action of galantamine by examining different synovium-derived 
microRNAs (miRs) and their related pathogenic pathways. The study also focuses 
on how parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways in the synovial tissue could 
affect the mode of action and anti-arthritic effect of galantamine. Chemical 
sympathectomy was initiated in 12 adjuvant arthritic rats by exposure to 
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 2 × 50 mg/kg) on day 9 after adjuvant injection and 
again (2 × 100 mg/kg) one week later. Six rats were treated with galantamine 
(2.5 mg/kg/day) to explore the influence of sympathetic impairment on 
galantamine effect. Another twelve additional adjuvant arthritic rats were 
exposed to the selective α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker 
methylcaconitine citrate (MLA; 5.6 mg/kg/day), 15 min before galantamine 
treatment. As control, six adjuvant arthritic rats were treated with galantamine 
alone. Treatment proceeded for 5 days, from day 14 till day 18 post-adjuvant 
injection. Different miRs and their related pathogenic pathways were examined. 
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was also measured in joint tissue. 
Galantamine affected the expression of the different miRs and their related 
parameters. Both, 6-OHDA and MLA, interrupted the 
anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic effect of galantamine to different extent. 
Additionally, TH expression in the synovium was affected by galantamine, 
suggesting a novel pathogenic target in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Indomethacin (IMC)-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injuries are more common in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients than in other IMC users, and the 
overexpression of nitric oxide (NO) via inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is related 
to the seriousness of IMC-induced GI injuries. However, sufficient strategies to 
prevent IMC-induced GI injuries have not yet been established. In this study, we 
designed dispersions of rebamipide (RBM) solid nanocrystals (particle size: 
30-190 nm) by a bead mill method (RBM-NDs), and investigated whether the oral 
administration of RBM-NDs is useful to prevent IMC-induced GI injuries. The RBM 
nanocrystals were spherical and had a solubility 4.71-fold greater than 
dispersions of traditional RBM powder (RBM-TDs). In addition, the RBM-NDs were 
stable for 1 month after preparation. The RBM contents in the stomach, jejunum, 
and ileum of rats orally administered RBM-NDs were significantly higher than in 
rats administered RBM-TDs. Moreover, the oral administration of RBM-NDs 
decreased the NO levels via iNOS and area of the GI lesions in IMC-stimulated RA 
(adjuvant-induced arthritis rat) rats in comparison with the oral administration 
of RBM-TDs. Thus, we show that the oral administration of RBM-NDs provides a 
high drug supply to the GI mucosa, resulting in a therapeutic effect on 
IMC-induced GI injuries. Solid nanocrystalline RBM preparations may offer 
effective therapy for RA patients.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1P1) is essential for lymphocyte 
egress from lymphoid organs into systemic circulation and provides a 
well-defined drug target for autoimmune disorders. IMMH001, also called SYL930, 
is a specific S1P1/S1P4/S1P5 modulator. Here, we investigated the potential 
therapeutic effect of IMMH001 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IMMH001 rendered 
periphery blood lymphocytes insensitive to the egress signal from secondary 
lymphoid organs. Importantly, in both rat adjuvant-induced arthritis and 
collagen-induced arthritis models, IMMH001 treatment significantly inhibited the 
progression of RA and RA-associated histological changes in the joints of 
Sprague-Dawley rats, including hind paw swelling and arthritic index, and thus 
reduced the pathological score. Furthermore, IMMH001 markedly decreased 
proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine release from the damaged joints. These 
data demonstrated that IMMH001 is a promising drug candidate for RA treatment.

We studied the effect of 4-methyl-phenyl biguanide, a substance chosen by PASS 
software (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substance), on oxidative status and 
activity of oxidation metabolism enzymes participating in limitation free 
radical processes (aconitate hydratase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 
NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase) in the heart and blood serum of rats with 
cardiovascular pathology developing against the background of experimental 
rheumatoid arthritis. Activity of cardiomyocyte cytolysis markers in rat blood 
serum was also measured. Normalization of the studied parameters under the 
influence of the test compound in animals with experimental pathology attests to 
its positive effects on metabolic and free radical processes.

Antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines are one of the most promising 
strategies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. They act by inducing potent 
immune tolerance instead of generalized immunosuppression. Recently, we 
developed a novel antigen-specific tolerizing DNA vaccine pcDNA-CCOL2A1 coding 
for chicken type II collagen (CCII) and confirmed its potent therapeutic 
efficacy in an established rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Here 
we report the prophylactic vaccination efficacy of a single 300 μg/kg dose of 
pcDNA-CCOL2A1 against CIA incidence, severity, and onset. CCOL2A1 transcripts 
were detected in the blood of CIA rats 14-42 days after intramuscular injection 
by 300 μg/kg pcDNA-CCOL2A1. The expression of CCOL2A1 transcripts increased 
quickly on day 21, peaked at day 28, and then gradually decreased thereafter. 
Importantly, a single prophylactic vaccination of pcDNA-CCOL2A1 14 days before 
CIA establishment significantly reduced CIA incidence and severity, deferred its 
onset, and was as efficacious as the current gold standard drug, methotrexate. 
The marked effects on CIA incidence and severity closely corresponded to the 
expression of CCOL2A1. Furthermore, prophylactic vaccination with pcDNA-CCOL2A1 
markedly decreased serum content of anti-type II collagen (CII) immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) antibodies, induced Th1-to-Th2 and Tc1-to-Tc2 shifts, and decreased the 
percentages of CD4+CD29+ and Th17 T cells. Prophylactic vaccination with 
pcDNA-CCOL2A1 also downregulated various Th1 cytokines, while upregulating both 
the Th2-type cytokine interleukin-10 and the Th3-type cytokine transforming 
growth factor β. Our results indicate that the pcDNA-CCOL2A1 DNA vaccine acts as 
a highly efficient inducer of specific immunotolerance that could be a promising 
option for RA treatment in the near future.

OBJECTIVES: Metformin is a known therapeutic agent for diabetes. Recently, 
several reports suggested the possibility of improvement in autoimmune disease 
and malignancy conditions through the effect of metformin on the immune system. 
Although there have been reports on the therapeutic effects of metformin on 
mouse models of collagen-induced arthritis, simulating human rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), the effect of metformin on human RA remains unknown. Therefore, 
we investigated the inhibitory effect of metformin on the pathogenesis of human 
RA in vitro.
METHODS: Osteoclastogenesis was evaluated with or without metformin. through 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, osteoclast-specific enzyme 
expression analysis, and a bone resorption assay. Human fibroblast-like 
synoviocyte MH7A cells were stimulated with TNF-α, and the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines and protease and growth factor genes was evaluated 
with or without metformin. Metformin has been used to evaluate their potential 
modulatory effects on cells treated with TNF-α. Moreover, we examined 
angiogenesis by performing a tube formation assay using human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) with or without metformin.
RESULTS: Osteoclastogenesis was suppressed in the presence of metformin, and the 
expression of osteoclast-specific genes was reduced. The TNF-α-induced 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and protease and growth factor genes in 
MH7A cells was downregulated by metformin. Additionally, the induced formation 
of tubular networks in HUVECs was also disrupted following treatment with 
metformin.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that metformin might improve the pathogenesis 
of RA, including joint inflammation and destruction. Thus, metformin might be 
utilised as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of RA.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of iguratimod 
and its regulatory role on microRNA (miR-146a) and the downstream genes in 
treating rheumatoid arthritis-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model.
METHODS: RA-FLS was isolated from knee synovial tissue of an active RA patient. 
In vitro, the effect of miR-146a mimic/inhibition on RA-FLS functions was 
investigated. Then the effect of Iguratimod on cell viability, proliferation, 
apoptosis, migration, invasion, inflammatory cytokines, miR-146a and its 
downstream gene/pathway in RA-FLS was evaluated. In vivo, the collagen induced 
arthritis (CIA) rat model was constructed, then the effects of iguratimod, 
miR-146a inhibition and their combination on treating CIA rat were assessed.
RESULTS: Iguratimod treatment increased miR-146a while decreased cell 
proliferation, IRAK1 and TRAF6/JNK1 pathway in RA-FLS in a dose-dependent 
manner. Notably, iguratimod treatment repressed cell proliferation, migration, 
invasion, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IRAK1 and TRAF6/JNK1 pathway in RA-FLS, 
while miR-146a inhibition alleviated the abovementioned effects of Iguratimod on 
RA-FLS. The in vivo experiments disclosed that iguratimod reduced systemic 
arthritis score, and decreased TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IRAK1 as well as 
TRAF6/JNK1 pathway, while enhanced apoptosis in synovial tissue of CIA rat 
model; and in miR-146a inhibition treated CIA rat model, the effect of 
iguratimod was diminished.
CONCLUSIONS: Iguratimod ameliorates RA progression via regulating miR-146a 
mediated IRAK1 expression and TRAF6/JNK1 pathway.

We aimed to investigate the regulation of circular RNAs in lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-treated chondrocytes isolated from SD rat. In this study, we analyzed how 
circFADS2 was regulated in LPS-treated chondrocytes and isolates from Rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) patients and found that circFADS2 and mTOR were highly expressed 
whereas miR-498 expression was significantly reduced. We then silenced circFADS2 
in LPS-treated chondrocytes; this resulted in a declined expression of type II 
collagen, but an increase in the expression of MMP-13, COX-2, and IL-6. Overall, 
silencing circFADS2 caused a significant reduction in the proliferative rate of 
LPS-treated chondrocytes, increased apoptotic levels, miR-498 upregulation, and 
mTOR downregulation. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that circFADS2 
directly targeted miR-498. In contrast, miR-498 down-regulation affected 
circFADS2 silencing, promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and 
apoptosis. The 3' UTR of the mTOR gene is targeted by miR-498, and consequently, 
in cells transfected with miR-498, there was a significant reduction of mTOR 
expression at the protein and mRNA levels. Silencing mTOR had a similar effect 
to circFADS2 silencing on type II collagen, MMP-13, COX-2, and IL-6 expression, 
as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, circFADS2 may affect 
LPS-induced chondrocytes properties by regulating the ECM catabolism, 
inflammation, and apoptosis in chondrocytes.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder whose treatment is mostly 
restricted to pain and symptom management and to the delay of joint destruction. 
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from the umbilical cord tissue (UC-MSCs) have 
previously been proven to be immunomodulatory and more efficient than bone 
marrow-derived MSCs in causing remission of local and systemic arthritic 
manifestations in vivo. Given the paracrine nature of UC-MSC activity, their 
application as active substances can be replaced by their secretome, thus 
avoiding allogeneic rejection and safety issues related to unwanted grafting. In 
this work, we aimed at demonstrating the viability of applying the 3D-primed 
UC-MSC secretome for the amelioration of arthritic signs. A proteomic analysis 
was performed to both, media conditioned by UC-MSC monolayer (CM2D) and 3D 
cultures (CM3D). The analysis of relevant trophic factors confirmed secretome 
profiles with very significant differences in terms of therapeutic potential. 
Whereas, CM3D was characterised by a prevailing expression of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-10 and LIF, along with trophic factors involved in 
different mechanisms leading to tissue regeneration, such as PDGF-BB, FGF-2, 
I-309, SCF, and GM-CSF; CM2D presented relatively higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, 
and IL-21, with recognised pro-inflammatory roles in joint disease and 
pleiotropic effects in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Accordingly, different motogenic effects over mouse chondrocytes and distinct 
capacities of inducing glycosaminoglycan synthesis in vitro were observed 
between CM3D and CM2D. Finally, the evaluation of arthritic manifestations in 
vivo, using an adjuvant-induced model for arthritis (AIA), suggested a 
significantly higher therapeutic potential of CM3D over CM2D and even UC-MSCs. 
Histological analysis confirmed a faster remission of local and systemic 
arthritic manifestations of CM3D-treated animals. Overall, the results show that 
the use of UC-MSC CM3D is a viable and better strategy than direct UC-MSC 
administration for counteracting AIA-related signs. This strategy represents a 
novel MSC-based but nonetheless cell-free treatment for arthritic conditions 
such as those characterising RA.

OBJECTIVE: The association between inflammation and dysregulated bone remodeling 
is apparent in rheumatoid arthritis and is recapitulated in the human tumor 
necrosis factor transgenic (hTNFtg) mouse model. We investigated whether 
extracellular binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) would protect the hTNFtg 
mouse from both inflammatory arthritis as well as extensive systemic bone loss 
and whether BiP had direct antiosteoclast properties in vitro.
METHODS: hTNFtg mice received a single intraperitoneal administration of BiP at 
onset of arthritis. Clinical disease parameters were measured weekly. Bone 
analysis was performed by microcomputed tomography and histomorphometry. Mouse 
bone marrow macrophage and human peripheral blood monocyte precursors were used 
to study the direct effect of BiP on osteoclast differentiation and function in 
vitro. Monocyte and osteoclast signaling was analyzed by Western blotting, flow 
cytometry, and imaging flow cytometry.
RESULTS: BiP-treated mice showed reduced inflammation and cartilage destruction, 
and histomorphometric analysis revealed a decrease in osteoclast number with 
protection from systemic bone loss. Abrogation of osteoclast function was also 
observed in an ex vivo murine calvarial model. BiP inhibited differentiation of 
osteoclast precursors and prevented bone resorption by mature osteoclasts in 
vitro. BiP also induced downregulation of CD115/c-Fms and Receptor Activator of 
NF-κB (RANK) messenger RNA and protein, causing reduced phosphorylation of the 
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 
1/2 and p38, with suppression of essential osteoclast transcription factors, 
c-Fos and NFATc1. BiP directly inhibited TNF-α- or Receptor Activator of NF-κB 
Ligand (RANKL)-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation in THP-1 monocytic cells and 
preosteoclasts by the canonical and noncanonical pathways.
CONCLUSION: BiP combines an anti-inflammatory function with antiosteoclast 
activity, which establishes it as a potential novel therapeutic for inflammatory 
disorders associated with bone loss.

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) plays a central role in the induction of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). In the present study, we demonstrated that lipidoid-polymer 
hybrid nanoparticle (FS14-NP) can efficiently deliver siRNA against IL-1β 
(siIL-1β) to macrophages and effectively suppress the pathogenesis of 
experimental arthritis induced by collagen antibody (CAIA mice). FS14-NP/siIL-1β 
achieved approximately 70% and 90% gene-silencing efficiency in the RAW 264.7 
cell line and intraperitoneal macrophages, respectively. Intravenous 
administration of FS14-NP/siRNA led to rapid accumulation of siRNA in 
macrophages within the arthritic joints. Furthermore, FS14-NP/siIL-1β treatment 
lowered the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in arthritic joints and 
dramatically attenuated ankle swelling, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction. 
These results demonstrate that FS14-NP/siIL-1β may represent an effective 
therapy for systemic arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.

Wutou Decoction (WTD) achieves favorable therapeutic response in treating 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially for wind-cold-dampness stimulating RA. 
However, its material basis and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To address 
this problem, the main bioactive compounds (BACs) of WTD against RA and the 
candidate targets were identified in the current study via transcriptional 
regulatory network analysis, computational structure-based methods, as well as 
in vivo and in vitro experimental validations. As a result, we successfully 
established a RA rat model named AIA-S, which simulated the clinical 
manifestations and pathological changes of wind-cold-dampness stimulating RA, 
and also displayed the distinctive characteristics and biological basis of 
inflammatory-immune system imbalance and abnormal energy metabolism changes. In 
addition, ALOX15B-PPAR-γ-PTGS2-FGF2-IL-1β-c-JUN-MMP13-TGF-β1 signal axis, 
involved into thermogenesis and energy metabolism, as well as maintaining the 
balance of inflammation-immune system, was identified as a candidate target of 
WTD against RA, according to the transcriptional regulatory network analysis on 
"RA-related gene-WTD-effective gene interaction network". Moreover, Paeoniflorin 
(PAE) and Talatizidine (TLT) were demonstrated to be the main BACs of WTD 
against RA for the following reasons: firstly, both PAE and TLT were the BACs of 
WTD according to ADME analysis in silico and the pharmacokinetics analysis in 
vivo. Secondly, both PAE and TLT were able to bind with PPAR-γ, c-JUN, MMP13 and 
TGF-β1, which were the candidate targets of WTD against RA, with the strong 
binding affinity. Thirdly, the PAE and TLT combination exerted significant 
therapeutic effects on AIA-S rats through reversing the imbalance of 
inflammatory-immune system, and the disturbance of thermogenesis and energy 
metabolism, which were similar to WTD. More importantly, the administration of 
TLT or PAE alone didn't exert as prominently therapeutic effects as that of the 
two-BAC-combination did. Fourthly, the PAE and TLT combination promoted 
adipogenesis and lipogenesis by upregulating the PPAR-γ-induced lipogenic 
proteins. In conclusion, this study identified PAE and TLT as the main BACs of 
WTD in alleviating the severity of RA, and also developed a novel combination of 
PAE and TLT as a promising candidate drug for RA therapy.

Chronically activated CD4+ T cells drive uncontrolled inflammation, leading to 
tissue damage in various autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in RA and recent 
analysis of transcriptomic profiles has implicated members of the nuclear 
receptor (NR) superfamily in RA. NRs are required for the development, 
differentiation, and effector function of CD4+ T cells; therefore, it is thought 
that NRs are important in shaping the CD4+ T cell repertoire and associated 
inflammation in RA. Despite their relevance, the full potential of the NR 
superfamily in RA, either as biomarkers or disease targets, has not been 
harnessed. To gain insight on the NR members that are closely associated with RA 
disease activity, we generated an expression atlas for the NR superfamily in 
CD4+ T cells isolated either in a steady state or over the course of 
collagen-induced arthritis mouse model of RA. We observed discrete expression 
patterns among the NR superfamily during the disease stages. NRs that instigate 
anti-inflammatory programs underwent major downregulation during disease onset; 
however, during the fully developed disease stage we noticed that NRs that 
induce proinflammatory programs had reduced transcript levels. These animal 
findings corroborated well with the expression patterns of NRs in clinical 
samples obtained from RA patients. Furthermore, we observed that targeting NRs 
using synthetic ligands alleviates the progression of collagen-induced 
arthritis. Overall, our data demonstrates the potential of the NR superfamily as 
novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

BACKGROUND: Notch pathway is highly conserved across species and is involved in 
the regulation of cell differentiation and activity both in embryonic 
development and adult life. Notch signaling has an important role in the 
development of hematopoietic stem cells and their differentiation to committed 
lineages, as well as in the regulation of several non-hematopoietic cell lines.
OBJECTIVE: As Notch signaling has been implicated in various inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases, it is of interest to elucidate what role do Notch receptors 
and ligands have in inflammatory arthritides.
METHODS: We performed a search on the role of Notch receptors (1-4) and Notch 
ligands Delta-like (DLL) 1, 3, 4 and Jagged (Jag) 1 and 2 in animal models of 
inflammatory arthritis and most common types of human inflammatory arthritis 
(rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis). The 
initial search identified 135 unique articles, of which 24 were ultimately 
deemed relevant and included in this systematic review.
RESULTS: Overall, identified articles describe roles for Notch ligands and 
receptors in inflammatory arthritis, with Notch activation resulting in enhanced 
Th1/17 polarization, osteoclast differentiation, macrophage activation and 
fibroblast-like synoviocyte proliferation. However, the inhibitory role of Notch 
signaling, especially by Jag1 is also described.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence that Notch pathway activation affects multiple 
cell lineages present within the arthritic environment, therefore potentially 
acting as one of the drivers of disease pathogenesis. Since cell 
lineage-selective transgenic mouse models and specific Notch receptor inhibitors 
are becoming increasingly available, it can be expected that future research 
will evaluate whether Notch signaling components initiate crucial pathogenic 
impulses and, therefore, present viable therapeutic targets in inflammatory 
arthritis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic 
autoimmune inflammatory disease which poses a need to explore effective yet safe 
pharmacotherapeutic options. The current work aimed to study the therapeutic 
role of nicorandil in controlling RA.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis model 
was applied by injecting 400 μL of CFA in the right hind paw at day 0 and day 7. 
Four groups of rats were used as follows: normal-control (CTRL), CFA-induced 
arthritis (ART), CFA-induced arthritis treated with diclofenac (DIC) and 
CFA-induced arthritis treated with nicorandil (NIC). Both NIC and DIC were 
administered at day 14 for two weeks. Paw volume, knee joint diameter, pain 
behavior assessment as well as body weight were all periodically recorded 
throughout the experimental period. Following the sacrifice of animals at day 
28, gene expressions of TLR-4, MyD88 and TRAF6 as well as extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor 
Kappa B (NF-κB) were quantified in hind paws tissue. Finally, the serum levels 
of the inflammatory biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) together with the histopathological examination 
of sections in the rat hind paw were recorded.
RESULTS: Both NIC and DIC proved promising anti-arthritic potential mediated, at 
least in part through switching off TLR4-MyD88-TRAF6 axis as well as downstream 
TRAF6 dependent activated MAP kinases and NF-κB.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Nicorandil, via interfering with TLR4 signaling, 
sheds light on a potential clinical role of the drug in pursuit for safe and 
effective regimens for RA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential therapeutic effect in a rheumatoid 
arthritis model of stable human CD8+ regulatory T cells (hCD8+Tregs) induced by 
TGF-β1 and rapamycin (RAPA) in vitro.
METHODS: Human CD8+T cells were isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells and induced/expanded with TGF-β1 and RAPA along with anti-CD3/28 beads and 
IL-2 in vitro and harvested as hCD8+Tregs. The phenotypes, suppressive 
characteristics, and stability of the hCD8+Tregs in an inflammatory 
microenvironment were examined in vitro. Human CD8+Tregs were transfused into an 
acollagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, and their therapeutic effects and 
related mechanisms were investigated.
RESULTS: Human CD8+Tregs induced by TGF-β1/RAPA showed high expression of Foxp3 
and CD103, exhibited vigorous suppression ability, and were stable in 
inflammatory microenvironments. In CIA mice, the clinical scores, levels of 
anti-collagen IgG antibody, and cartilage destruction were significantly reduced 
after adoptive transfusion with hCD8+Tregs. Moreover, hCD8+Treg treatment 
significantly reduced the number of Th17 cells, increased the number of 
CD4+IFN-γ +T cells, and produced self CD4+Foxp3+Tregs in vivo. In an in vitro 
cell coculture assay, hCD8+Tregs significantly inhibited mouse CD4+ effector T 
cell proliferation, induced mouse CD4+Foxp3+Treg and CD4+IFN-γ +Th1 cell 
production, reduced Th17 cell development, and downregulated CD80/86 expression 
on mature DCs (mDCs).
CONCLUSION: TGF-β1/RAPA can induce hCD8+Tregs with stable suppressive 
characteristics, which could significantly alleviate the severity of CIA based 
on their stable suppressive ability in an inflammatory microenvironment and 
further influence the function of other downstream cell subtypes. Human 
CD8+Tregs might be a therapeutic strategy for rheumatoid arthritis.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory effects of 
taxol (PTX) on angiogenesis in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. 
Collagen II (C II) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) were used in C57BL/6 
(H-2b) mice to generate the CIA model. Random grouping was performed in the 
normal control group, CIA model group, PTX 1.5 mg/kg group, PTX 1.0 mg/kg group, 
and PTX 0.5 mg/kg group. Arthritis index scores, tissue pathology scores, and 
synovium microvessel density (MVD) analysis were performed. Immunohistochemistry 
and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-α 
(HIF-1α). The correlation between MVD and pathological scores and between MVD 
and the expression of VEGF as well as HIF-1α in the synovium were also 
evaluated. After PTX treatment, the three intervention group arthritis index 
scores were reduced when compared with the CIA group. The total histological 
scores in the three PTX treatment groups were lower than those in the CIA group. 
Similarly, PTX significantly alleviated the scores for synovitis, pannus 
formation, and bone destruction. Compared with the CIA group, the MVD of the 
three intervention groups decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The expression 
of VEGF and HIF-1α in synovial tissues and serum also significantly decreased 
after PTX treatment. Further analysis showed that MVD and pathological scores 
and MVD and expression of VEGF as well as HIF-1α in the synovium were positively 
correlated. PTX may alleviate CIA by suppressing angiogenesis, providing new 
insights into the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). VEGF and HIF-1α may be 
targets for PTX suppression of microvessel formation.

Blocking the proteolytic capacity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 
with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) reduces arthritis progression in the 
collagen-induced mouse arthritis model to an extent that is on par with the 
effect of blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha by etanercept. Seeking to develop 
a novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a humanized mAb, NNC0266-0043, was 
selected for its dual inhibition of both the zymogen activation and the 
proteolytic capacity of human uPA. The antibody revealed nonlinear elimination 
kinetics in cynomolgus monkeys consistent with binding to and turnover of 
endogenous uPA. At a dose level of 20.6 mg kg-1, the antibody had a plasma 
half-life of 210 h. Plasma uPA activity, a pharmacodynamic marker of anti-uPA 
therapy, was reduced to below the detection limit during treatment, indicating 
that an efficacious plasma concentration was reached. Pharmacokinetic modeling 
predicted that sufficient antibody levels can be sustained in arthritis patients 
dosed subcutaneously once weekly. The anti-uPA mAb was also well tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys at weekly doses up to 200 mg kg-1 over 4 weeks. The data from 
cynomolgus monkeys and from human material presented here indicates that 
anti-uPA mAb NNC0266-0043 is suitable for clinical testing as a novel 
therapeutic for rheumatic diseases. KEY MESSAGES: Background: Anti-uPA therapy 
is on par with etanercept in a mouse arthritis model. A new humanized antibody 
blocks activation and proteolytic activity of human uPA. The antibody represents 
a radically novel mode-of-action in anti-rheumatic therapy. The antibody has 
PK/PD properties in primates consistent with QW clinical dosing.

Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is the anchor drug for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is inexpensive, effective, and generally safe. 
When clinical response is inadequate, biological therapies are commonly used in 
combination with MTX. However, biological agents have safety concerns (i.e. 
infections, malignancy) and the addition of a biologic agent is expensive, 
making strategies to improve MTX efficacy important. Inhibition of pathways of 
folate metabolism involving purine metabolism by MTX, have been traditionally 
emphasized as important in MTX efficacy. However, inhibition MTX catabolism may 
also be important. MTX is irreversibly hydroxylated to form 7-hydroxy 
methotrexate (7-OH-MTX) by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) (AOX). Catabolism of 
MTX to 7-OH-MTX is the first metabolic process imposed on an oral dose of MTX 
and will alter subsequent interactions of MTX with other enzymes. 7-OH-MTX is 
less potent than MTX in the treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis. RA patients 
with a low capacity to catabolize MTX to 7-OH-MTX do better clinically than 
individuals who are rapid formers of 7-OH-MTX. Therefore, altering the 
catabolism of MTX may be an innovative way to improve MTX efficacy. Raloxifene 
is a FDA-approved therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis and for the reduction 
of invasive breast cancers but has no known activity in RA. Raloxifene is a 
potent inhibitor of human liver AOX. Postmenopausal women with RA frequently 
have low bone mineral density and would be candidates for raloxifene and MTX 
combination therapy. The effect of raloxifene on MTX metabolism has never been 
studied. Our hypothesis is that in postmenopausal women with RA and osteoporosis 
treated with MTX and raloxifene, the inhibition of AOX with resultant decreased 
formation of 7-OH MTX; will increase MTX levels and improve MTX efficacy. This 
hypothesis could be studied in an open-label, proof of concept clinical study in 
individuals before and after the addition of raloxifene. Red blood cell MTX and 
7-OH-MTX levels and RA disease activity (DAS28) would be measured. In possible 
future studies, there are dietary substances, as supplements, (e.g. 
epigallocatechin gallate in green tea and resveratrol) which inhibit human liver 
AOX which could be evaluated.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune disease associated with 
progressive disability, systemic complications, and poor prognosis. The improved 
understanding of the roles of immune signaling pathway inhibitors has shed light 
on designing new and more effective approaches for RA treatment. In this work, 
an inflammation-responsive and molecularly targeted drug system has been 
developed for RA therapy. The drug carrier was synthesized by covalently 
grafting hydrophobic cholesterol (Chol) molecules onto a hydrophilic chondroitin 
sulfate (CS) chain via the inflammation-responsive diselenide bonds (SeSe). The 
resultant amphiphilic polymer CSSeSeChol readily forms nanoparticles (NPs) and 
encapsulates two kinase inhibitors tofacitinib and SP600125 in aqueous media. 
Upon administration into the RA mouse model, the nanodrug accumulates in RA 
lesions and releases the inhibitors for regulating the JAK-STAT and JNK 
pathways. As a result, the nanodrug exhibits satisfactory efficacy in RA 
treatment by suppressing the expression of relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
blocking the activation of osteoclasts and providing protection for cartilage 
and joints.

CTLA4-Ig (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin; Abatacept) is a 
biologic drug for rheumatoid arthritis. CTLA4 binds to the CD80/86 complex of 
antigen-presenting cells and blocks the activation of T cells. Although previous 
reports showed that CTLA4-Ig directly inhibited osteoclast differentiation, the 
whole inhibitory mechanism of CTLA4-Ig for osteoclast differentiation is 
unclear. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from WT mice were cultured with M-CSF 
and RANKL with or without the recombinant mouse chimera CTLA4-Ig. Intracellular 
calcium oscillations of BMMs with RANKL were detected by staining with calcium 
indicator fura-2 immediately after administration of CTLA4-Ig or after one day 
of treatment. Calcium oscillations were analyzed using Fc receptor gamma- 
(FcRγ-) deficient BMMs. CTLA4-Ig inhibited osteoclast differentiation and 
reduced the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cells NFATc1 in BMMs 
in vitro. Calcium oscillations in BMMs were suppressed by CTLA4-Ig both 
immediately after administration and after one day of treatment. CTLA4-Ig did 
not affect osteoclastogenesis and did not cause remarkable changes in calcium 
oscillations in FcRγ-deficient BMMs. Finally, to analyze the effect of CTLA4-Ig 
in vivo, we used an LPS-induced osteolysis model. CTLA4-Ig suppressed 
LPS-induced bone resorption in WT mice, not in FcRγ-deficient mice. In 
conclusion, CTLA4-Ig inhibits intracellular calcium oscillations depending on 
FcRγ and downregulates NFATc1 expression in BMMs. © 2019 American Society for

BACKGROUND: The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal 
center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive immunity 
and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines by B cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of 
Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and 
is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the 
therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune 
response.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of 
TGP on RA.
STUDY DESIGN: Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and 
TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.
METHODS: DBA/1 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, model, positive drug 
(paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric 
administration, the pathological change, inflammation expression and molecular 
mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical 
analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved inflammation 
and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 in a 
dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of 
germinal center B cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.
CONCLUSION: TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone 
destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by 
inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 
signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To study the involvement of Treg cells expressing tumor necrosis 
factor receptor type II (TNFRII) in exerting control of inflammation in 
experimental models and in the response to anti-TNF treatments in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: The role of TNFRII in Treg cells was explored using a multilevel 
translational approach. Treg cell stability was evaluated by analyzing the 
methylation status of the Foxp3 locus using bisulfite sequencing. Two models of 
inflammation (imiquimod-induced skin inflammation and delayed-type 
hypersensitivity arthritis [DTHA]) were induced in TNFRII-/- mice, with or 
without transfer of purified CD4+CD25+ cells from wild-type (WT) mice. In 
patients with RA and those with SpA, the evolution of the TNFRII+ Treg cell 
population before and after targeted treatment was monitored.
RESULTS: Foxp3 gene methylation in Treg cells was greater in TNFRII-/- mice than 
in WT mice (50% versus 36.7%). In cultured Treg cells, TNF enhanced the 
expression, maintenance, and proliferation of Foxp3 through TNFRII signaling. 
Imiquimod-induced skin inflammation and DTHA were aggravated in TNFRII-/- mice 
(P < 0.05 for mice with skin inflammation and P < 0.0001 for mice with ankle 
swelling during DTHA compared to WT mice). Adoptive transfer of WT mouse Treg 
cells into TNFRII-/- mice prevented aggravation of arthritis. In patients with 
RA receiving anti-TNF treatments, but not those receiving tocilizumab, the 
frequency of TNFRII+ Treg cells was increased at 3 months of treatment compared 
to baseline (mean ± SEM 65.2 ± 3.1% versus 49.1 ± 5.5%; P < 0.01). In contrast, 
in anti-TNF-treated patients with SpA, the frequency of TNFRII+ Treg cells was 
not modified.
CONCLUSION: TNFRII expression identifies a subset of Treg cells that are 
characterized by stable expression of Foxp3 via gene hypomethylation, and 
adoptive transfer of TNFRII-expressing Treg cells ameliorates inflammation in 
experimental models. Expansion and activation of TNFRII+ Treg cells may be one 
of the mechanisms by which anti-TNF agents control inflammation in RA, but not 
in SpA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by 
inflammatory synovitis, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. NLRC5 is a newly 
discovered member of the NLR family that is effective in regulating 
autoimmunity, inflammatory responses, and cell death processes. Dexmedetomidine 
(DEX) has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological effects, including 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, the role of DEX in RA has not 
been explored. In adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rat models, DEX (10 μg/kg and 
20 μg/kg) reduced the pathological score, the arthritis score, paw swelling 
volume, and the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-α. Moreover, by 
using Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), it was demonstrated 
that DEX can inhibit the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-9 and P-P65 in 
the synovial tissue of AA rats. In human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (RA-FLSs), DEX (250 nM and 500 nM) was found to inhibit the 
expression of IL-1β, IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-9, and P-P65 following stimulation with 
TNF-α. Moreover, DEX can inhibit the invasion and migration of RA-FLSs 
stimulated by TNF-α. Finally, the expression of NLRC5 in RA-FLSs and AA rat 
models was also reduced by DEX. After silencing NLRC5 in RA-FLSs, the expression 
of IL-1β, IL-6, MMP-3, MMP-9, and P-P65, as well as the invasion and migration 
of cells, were significantly reduced. These results indicate that DEX inhibits 
the invasion, migration, and inflammation of RA-FLSs by reducing the expression 
of NLRC5 and inhibiting the NF-κB activation.

This study was to investigate the effect of methotrexate in combination therapy 
by the characteristic cytokine in Th17 cells and the frequency of Tregs, which 
involved in the induction and pathological progress of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). The collagen-induced arthritis rats were treated with methotrexate + 
prednisone, methotrexate + disease-modifying rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and 
methotrexate + TNFi, respectively. The following parameters were observed to 
evaluate three treatments: the frequency and function of Th17 cells and Tregs, 
the scores of X-rays, H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. For rats starting 
methotrexate + prednisone (low doses), the frequency and suppressive function of 
Th17 cells decreased while the frequency of Tregs increased, which were the same 
in methotrexate + TNFi. Immunohistochemical in the pathological sections of 
ankle joint showed the same results. The effect of methotrexate + DMARDs 
treatment was slightly inferior to the other combination therapies. In summary, 
rats treated with methotrexate + prednisone can achieve high level of Tregs and 
low level of Th17 cells and IL-17. Low doses of glucocorticoid suggesting a 
critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis may have the similar 
effect as DMARDs.

Synovial fibroblasts have attracted considerable attention in studies of joint 
diseases. Although mice are useful and powerful in in vitro and in vivo 
experiments, primary cultures of mouse synovial fibroblasts are notoriously 
difficult because the mouse synovial tissues are much smaller and cell cycle 
arrests can be induced more easily in murine cells than in human cells. Here, we 
report a precise protocol for the isolation and culture of fibroblasts from 
mouse adipose and fibrous knee joint synovia. In both adipose and fibrous 
synovial fibroblasts, proliferation was decreased in addition to a higher rate 
of cellular senescence under normoxic conditions (20% O2); however, it was 
maintained over 20 days with low cellular senescence under hypoxic conditions 
(3% O2). The marker gene expression in adipose and fibrous synovial fibroblasts 
was not markedly altered after a 3-week culture. Both cells displayed similar 
potencies for chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic differentiation, and 
responses to a proinflammatory cytokine. The present method provides a 
sufficient amount of mouse synovial fibroblasts for in vitro and in vivo 
experiments in joint biology and the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis and 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Apigenin (API) is a plant flavone that is known to exert a protective effect in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is a chronic autoimmune disease. However, the 
molecular mechanism for API's protective effect against RA is still unclear. 
Here, a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used to assess the 
protective effect of API on RA. Histomorphological studies, 
immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blot were conducted to elucidate the 
roles of synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis in the 
protective effect of API on RA. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were 
isolated to measure the effect of API on FLS proliferation and apoptosis. API 
exhibited a significant protective effect in CIA mice in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner. An increase in apoptosis and decrease in proliferation 
were observed after the API treatment in FLSs, suggesting that API might inhibit 
synovial hyperplasia. Moreover, CIA angiogenesis was repressed by API via 
down-regulation of VEGF and VEGFR. Furthermore, API regulated the 
osteoclastogenesis-associated RANKL/RANK/OPG system in CIA mice. Therefore, API 
inhibits CIA by repressing synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and 
osteoclastogenesis. This suggested that API might be a putative low toxicity 
candidate drug for RA treatment.

Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combined gemfibrozil 
with prednisolone in the management of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat 
model. Methods: Seventy two adult male Wistar albino rats were divided equally 
into 1-control group, three diseased groups: 2- Adjuvant induced arthritis 
(AIA), 3- high fat diet (HF), and 4- combined AIA-HF, and treated groups: 5- 
gemfibrozil 30 mg/kg treated AIA group (AIA-G) and the combined AIA-HF treated 
groups: 6- prednisolone equivalent to human 10 mg (AIA-HF-P10), 7- prednisolone 
equivalent to human 5 mg (AIA-HF-P5) 8- gemfibrozil (HF-AIA-G) and 9- combined 
treatment (HF-AIA-G-P5) Results: HF diet represents a precipitating factor for 
knee arthritis. Gemfibrozil improved the inflammatory findings in both AIA and 
AIA-HF groups. Combined administration of gemfibrozil with reduced steroid dose 
gave a similar therapeutic effect to the full steroid dose. Fortunately, we 
reported more reduction in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and high mobility 
group box 1 (HMGB1) in the HF-AIA-G-P5 compared with the HF-AIA-P10 group. The 
improvement was proved by the histological findings. Conclusion: Combined 
reduced prednisolone dose with gemfibrozil potentiates its anti-inflammatory 
activity. This could be a target in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.

Function Unit, Eisai Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan.

BACKGROUND: E6011, a humanized antifractalkine monoclonal antibody, is under 
development for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis. A reproducible assay method has been developed for the 
determination of E6011 in monkey and human serum by electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL) assay.
METHODS: E6011 in serum was captured by fractalkine and detected by 
ruthenium-labeled rabbit anti-E6011 Fab polyclonal antibodies for ECL detection. 
E6011 in serum was quantifiable from 0.02 and 0.1 μg/mL in monkey and human 
serum, respectively, with minimum required dilution of 500. The method was then 
validated in accordance with bioanalytical guidelines.
RESULTS: Accuracy and precision of quality control samples at five 
concentrations in intra- and interbatch reproducibility demonstrated that 
relative error and relative standard deviation were within acceptable criteria. 
Recovery of E6011 was 92.9%-121.7% and 85.0%-109.3% in humans and monkeys. 
Dilution integrity, no prozone effects, and no impacts by antigen were also 
ensured. Parallelism was also confirmed using incurred clinical sample analysis. 
Various types of stability were assessed, which confirmed that E6011 in serum 
was stable for 367 and 735 days in monkey and human sera, respectively, under 
frozen conditions.
CONCLUSION: The developed method was successfully applied supporting 
pharmacokinetic studies in monkeys and humans.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by 
chronic inflammation and progressive destruction of joint tissue. It is also 
characterized by aberrant blood phenotypes including anemia and suppressed 
lymphopoiesis that contribute to morbidity in RA patients. However, the impact 
of RA on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has not been fully elucidated. Using a 
collagen-induced mouse model of human RA, we identified systemic inflammation 
and myeloid overproduction associated with activation of a myeloid 
differentiation gene program in HSC. Surprisingly, despite ongoing inflammation, 
HSC from arthritic mice remain in a quiescent state associated with activation 
of a proliferation arrest gene program. Strikingly, we found that inflammatory 
cytokine blockade using the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra led to an 
attenuation of inflammatory arthritis and myeloid expansion in the bone marrow 
of arthritic mice. In addition, anakinra reduced expression of 
inflammation-driven myeloid lineage and proliferation arrest gene programs in 
HSC of arthritic mice. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cytokine 
blockade can contribute to normalization of hematopoiesis in the context of 
chronic autoimmune arthritis.

Despite recent advances in understanding chronic inflammation remission, global 
analyses have not been explored to systematically discover genes or pathways 
underlying the resolution dynamics of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we 
performed time-course gene expression profiling of mouse synovial tissues along 
progression and resolution of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and identified 
genes associated with inflammation resolution. Through network analysis of these 
genes, we predicted 3 key secretory factors responsible for the resolution of 
CIA: Itgb1, Rps3, and Ywhaz. These factors were predominantly expressed by Tregs 
and antiinflammatory M2 macrophages, suppressing production of proinflammatory 
cytokines. In particular, Ywhaz was elevated in the sera of mice with arthritis 
resolution and in the urine of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with good 
therapeutic responses. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated transfer of the Ywhaz gene 
to the affected joints substantially inhibited arthritis progression in mice 
with CIA and suppressed expression of proinflammatory cytokines in joint 
tissues, lymph nodes, and spleens, suggesting Ywhaz is an excellent target for 
RA therapy. Therefore, our comprehensive analysis of dynamic synovial 
transcriptomes provides previously unidentified antiarthritic genes, Itgb1, 
Rps3, and Ywhaz, which can serve as molecular markers to predict disease 
remission, as well as therapeutic targets for chronic inflammatory arthritis.

Etanercept is a soluble form of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) 
that inhibits pathological tumor necrosis factor (TNF) responses in rheumatoid 
arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. However, besides TNF, etanercept also 
blocks lymphotoxin-α (LTα), which has no clear therapeutic value and might 
aggravate some of the adverse effects associated with etanercept. Poxviruses 
encode soluble TNFR2 homologs, termed viral TNF decoy receptors (vTNFRs), that 
display unique specificity properties. For instance, cytokine response modifier 
D (CrmD) inhibits mouse and human TNF and mouse LTα, but it is inactive against 
human LTα. Here, we analyzed the molecular basis of these immunomodulatory 
activities in the ectromelia virus-encoded CrmD. We found that the overall 
molecular mechanism to bind TNF and LTα from mouse and human origin is fairly 
conserved in CrmD and dominated by a groove under its 50s loop. However, other 
ligand-specific binding determinants optimize CrmD for the inhibition of mouse 
ligands, especially mouse TNF. Moreover, we show that the inability of CrmD to 
inhibit human LTα is caused by a Glu-Phe-Glu motif in its 90s loop. Importantly, 
transfer of this motif to etanercept diminished its anti-LTα activity in 
>60-fold while weakening its TNF-inhibitory capacity in 3-fold. This new 
etanercept variant could potentially be used in the clinic as a safer 
alternative to conventional etanercept. This work is the most detailed study of 
the vTNFR-ligand interactions to date and illustrates that a better knowledge of 
vTNFRs can provide valuable information to improve current anti-TNF therapies.

BACKGROUND: In the present study, we aimed to understand the expression and 
methylation levels of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts.
METHOD: The RA model was established using Freund's complete adjuvant, and then 
the synovial fibroblasts were isolated and cultured. Next, RNA extraction and 
reverse transcription were performed. The SOCS3 transcription level was detected 
using qPCR, and SOCS3 protein expression was detected using western blotting 
(WB). Lastly, methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed.
RESULTS: The RA model was successfully demonstrated. SOCS3 gene (p < .01) and 
protein expression levels were significantly increased in the RA rat group 
compared to in the wild type (WT) group. However, no significant difference was 
observed in the MSP products between the RA and WT groups.
CONCLUSION: The increased expression of the SOCS3 can be correlated with the 
development of RA.

Systemic delivery of siRNA to target tissues is difficult to achieve owing to 
its limited cellular uptake and poor serum stability. Herein, polymeric 
nanoparticles were developed for systemic administration of siRNA to inflamed 
tissues. The polymeric nanoparticles were composed of PK3 as a pH-sensitive 
polymer, folate-polyethyleneglycol-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) as a targeting 
ligand, and a DOTAP/siRNA core. The polymeric nanoparticles had a mean particle 
size of 142.6 ± 0.61 nm and a zeta potential of 3.6 ± 0.43 mV. In vitro studies 
indicated pH-dependent siRNA release from polymeric nanoparticles, with 
accelerated release at pH 5.0. Cellular uptake was efficient and gene silencing 
was confirmed by Western blot. In vivo, polymeric nanoparticles were shown to 
have inflammation-targeting activity and potent therapeutic effects in an 
adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model. These results suggest that pH-sensitive 
and folate receptor-targeted nanoparticles are a promising drug carrier for 
siRNA delivery for rheumatoid arthritis.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a key cytokine during inflammatory responses and 
its dysregulation is detrimental in many inflammatory diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we used a bacterial 
artificial chromosome (BAC) construct that expresses luciferase under the 
control of the human TNF locus to generate a novel transgenic mouse, the 
hTNF.LucBAC strain. In vitro stimulation of hTNF.LucBAC cells of different 
origin revealed a cell specific response to stimuli demonstrating the integrated 
construct's ability as a proxy for inflammatory gene response. 
Lipopolysaccharide was the most potent luciferase inducer in macrophages, while 
TNF was a strong activator in intestinal organoids. Lipopolysaccharide-induced 
luciferase activity in macrophages was downregulated by inhibitors of NF-κB 
pathway, as well as by Interleukin-10, a known anti-inflammatory cytokine. 
Moreover, the transgene-dependent luciferase activity showed a positive 
correlation to the endogenous murine soluble TNF secreted to the culture medium. 
In conclusion, the hTNF.LucBAC strain is a valuable tool for studying and 
screening molecules that target TNF synthesis and will allow further functional 
studies of the regulatory elements of the TNF locus.

We previously demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA increases the 
production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in mice. 
This property may contribute to the established association between EBV and 
autoimmune diseases. The objective of the present study was to elucidate 
mechanisms through which EBV DNA modulates IL-17A levels in mice. To determine 
whether endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) played a role in this pathway, the 
expression of TLR3, -7, or -9 was assessed by real-time reverse 
transcription-PCR in mouse spleens after injection of EBV DNA. Moreover, 
specific inhibitors were used for these TLRs in mouse peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured with EBV DNA and in mice injected with this 
viral DNA; IL-17A levels were then assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. The expression of the endosomal receptors TLR3, -7, and -9 was increased 
in mice injected with EBV DNA. When mouse immune cells were cultured with EBV 
DNA and a TLR3, -7, or -9 inhibitor or when mice were injected with the viral 
DNA along with either of these inhibitors, a significant decrease in IL-17A 
levels was detected. Therefore, endosomal TLRs are involved in the EBV 
DNA-mediated triggering of IL-17A production in mice. Targeting these receptors 
in EBV-positive subjects with autoimmunity may be useful pending investigations 
assessing whether they play a similar role in humans.IMPORTANCE Epstein-Barr 
virus is a pathogen that causes persistent infection with potential consistent 
viral DNA shedding. The enhancement of production of proinflammatory cytokines 
by viral DNA itself may contribute to autoimmune disease development or 
exacerbation. In this project, we identified that endosomal Toll-like receptors 
are involved in triggering proinflammatory mediators in response to viral DNA. 
Pathways and receptors involved may serve as future therapeutic targets for 
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and 
systemic lupus erythematosus.

BACKGROUND: Baihu-Guizhi decoction (BHGZD) has been extensively used for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a satisfying therapeutic effect. 
However, the material basis and the underlying mechanisms of BHGZD against RA 
have not been fully elucidated.
PURPOSE: To investigate the chemical profile and the pharmacological mechanisms 
of BHGZD against RA.
METHODS: The chemical constituents containing in BHGZD were identified using 
UFLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS system, and the corresponding putative targets were predicted. 
Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between adjuvant-induced 
arthritis (AIA) and normal control groups were identified using microarray 
analysis. After constructing the interaction network of "RA-related gene-BHGZD 
putative target", BHGZD candidate targets against RA were screened by 
topological analysis and further experimentally validated based on AIA rat 
model.
RESULTS: A total of 41 chemical constituents were identified in the water 
extract of BHGZD, which were predicted to hit 1312 putative targets. 
Additionally, 26 DEGs between the AIA and normal control groups were defined as 
"RA-related genes", which were functionally involved into the imbalance of 
"inflammation-immune" system during RA progression. On the basis of the 
topological importance in the network of "RA-related gene-BHGZD putative 
target", 177 BHGZD candidate targets against RA were identified. Among them, 
TLR4, c-Fos/AP-1, IL2 and TNF had direct interactions with each other and also 
function as crucial components of toll-like receptor and T cell receptor 
signaling pathways, which may play important roles in maintaining the balance of 
"inflammation-immune" system. Experimentally, we verified that BHGZD 
dose-dependently attenuated the severity, pathological changes, as well as 
mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivities during RA progression based on the 
AIA rat model. Further western blot analysis demonstrated that BHGZD 
significantly reduced the protein levels of TLR4, c-Fos/AP-1, IL2 and TNF, which 
were induced by RA modeling, in the inflamed joints of AIA rats (all p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study combining the chemical and transcriptomic profilings, 
target prediction, network calculation and experimental validations identifies 
the chemical constituents containing in BHGZD and offers the convincing evidence 
that BHGZD may ameliorate RA partially by restoring the balance of 
"inflammation-immune" system and subsequently reversing the pathological events 
during RA progression through regulating the TLR4-c-Fos-IL2-TNF axis.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells have anti-inflammatory functions and heighten immune 
tolerance. The proportion and functions of Treg cells are perturbed in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), contributing to the excessive immune activation 
associated with this disease. We therefore hypothesized that supplementation 
with foreign Treg cells could be used to treat RA. To investigate the 
therapeutic effects of exogenous Treg cells on RA and its mechanism, we used 
human Treg cells to treat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in a rat model to 
observe whether exogenous Treg cells can treat the disease across species. 
Successful treatment would indicate that Treg cell transplantation in humans is 
more likely to affect RA. In the present study, human Treg cells were collected 
from healthy human peripheral blood and culture-expanded in vitro. Induced human 
Treg cells were injected into CIA rats via the tail vein. The rats' lymphocyte 
subtypes, cytokines, and Th1/Th2 ratios were measured using flow cytometry. In 
the rats, following injection of the human Treg cells, the severity of CIA was 
significantly reduced (P < 0.01), the proportion of endogenous Treg cells 
increased in the peripheral blood and spleen (P = 0.007 and P < 0.01, 
respectively), and the proportion of B cells decreased (P = 0.031). The IL-5 
level, IL-6 level, and Th1/Th2 ratio in the peripheral blood were decreased (P = 
0.013, 0.009, and 0.012, respectively). The culture-expanded human Treg cells 
were also cultured with synovial fibroblast cells from RA patients (RASFs). 
After coculture with Treg cells, RASFs showed reduced proliferation (P < 0.01) 
and increased apoptosis (P = 0.037). These results suggest that exogenous and 
induced Treg cells can produce a therapeutic effect in RA and CIA by increasing 
endogenous Treg cells and RASF apoptosis and reducing B cells, the Th1/Th2 
ratio, and secretion levels of IL-5 and IL-6. Treg cell transplantation could 
serve as a therapy for RA that does not cause immune rejection.

Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F. (TwHF), a traditional Chinese Medicine, is 
effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its severe nephrotoxicity 
limits its extensive application. The nephrotoxic mechanism of Triptolide (TP), 
the main pharmacological and toxic component of TwHF, has not been fully 
revealed. This study was designed to explore the nephrotoxicity of TP in the RA 
state and the potential molecular mechanism. A rat collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) model was constructed and administered with TP for 28 days in vivo. 
Results showed that the kidney injury induced by TP was aggravated in the CIA 
state, the concentration of TP in the renal cortex was higher than that of the 
medulla after TP administration in the CIA rats, and the expression of organic 
cation transporter 2 (Oct2) in kidney was up-regulated under CIA condition. 
Besides, rat kidney slice study demonstrated that TP was transported by Oct2 and 
this was confirmed by transient silencing and overexpression of OCT2 in HEK-293T 
cells. Furthermore, cytoinflammatory models on HK-2 and HEK-293T cell lines were 
constructed by exposure of TNF-α or IL-1β to further explore the TP's renal 
toxicity. Results suggested that TNF-α exposure aggravated TP's toxicity and 
up-regulated the protein expression of OCT2 in both cell lines. TNF-α treatment 
also increased the function of OCT2 and finally OCT2 silencing confirmed OCT2 
mediated nephrotoxicity of TP in HEK-293T cells. In summary, the exposure of 
TNF-α in RA state induced the expression of OCT2, which transported more TP into 
kidney cortex, subsequently exacerbated the kidney injury.

Physical exercise (PE) is recommended for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but the 
molecular and biological mechanisms that impact the inflammatory process and 
joint destruction in RA remain unknown. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of PE on the histological and transcriptional changes in the 
joints of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. AIA rats were subjected to 
PE on a treadmill for eight weeks. The joints were subjected to histological and 
microarray analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by PE in the 
arthritic rats were obtained from the microarray. The bioinformatic analysis 
allowed the association of these genes in biological processes and signaling 
pathways. PE induced the differential expression of 719 genes. The DEGs were 
significantly associated with pathogenic mechanisms in RA, including HIF-1, 
VEGF, PI3-Akt, and Jak-STAT signaling pathways, as well as response to oxidative 
stress and inflammatory response. At a histological level, PE exacerbated joint 
inflammatory infiltrate and tissue destruction. The PE exacerbated the stressed 
joint environment aggravating the inflammatory process, the hypoxia, and the 
oxidative stress, conditions described as detrimental in the RA joints. Research 
on the effect of PE on the pathogenesis process of RA is still necessary for 
animal models and human.

Cathepsin C (CatC) is a dipeptidyl-exopeptidase which activates neutrophil 
serine protease precursors (elastase, proteinase 3, cathepsin G and NSP4) by 
removing their N-terminal propeptide in bone marrow cells at the promyelocytic 
stage of neutrophil differentiation. The resulting active proteases are 
implicated in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Hence, inhibition of 
CatC represents a therapeutic strategy to suppress excessive protease activities 
in various neutrophil mediated diseases. We designed and synthesized a series of 
dipeptidyl cyclopropyl nitrile compounds as putative CatC inhibitors. One 
compound, IcatCXPZ-01 
((S)-2-amino-N-((1R,2R)-1-cyano-2-(4'-(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylsulfonyl)biphenyl-4-yl)cyclopropyl)butanamide)) 
was identified as a potent inhibitor of both human and rodent CatC. In mice, 
pharmacokinetic studies revealed that IcatCXPZ-01 accumulated in the bone marrow 
reaching levels suitable for CatC inhibition. Subcutaneous administration of 
IcatCXPZ-01 in a monoclonal anti-collagen antibody induced mouse model of 
rheumatoid arthritis resulted in statistically significant anti-arthritic 
activity with persistent decrease in arthritis scores and paw thickness.

Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line of choice for the management of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and has been reported for its low bioavailability and side 
effects. Combination therapy has been widely investigated to overcome 
bioavailability issues and to reduce adverse effects associated with 
monotherapy. Various phytoconstituents such as resveratrol (RSV) and curcumin 
have been found to possess potent anti-inflammatory activity via downregulating 
the signaling of cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor 
alpha) and nuclear factor kappa B signaling. The prime objective of this study 
was to develop transdermal gel containing MTX-RSV loaded nanoemulsions (NEs) to 
overcome bioavailability issues and adverse effects of RA monotherapy. The NEs 
optimized by using Box-Behnken Design were incorporated within gel, and an in 
vitro skin permeation study performed on rat skin by using vertical Franz 
diffusion cells exhibited controlled drug release up to 48 h. Subsequently, 
anti-inflammatory and potential anti-arthritic activities of the combination in 
nanocarrier were assessed in rats and showed 78.76 ± 4.16% inhibition in 
inflammation and better anti-arthritic effects. Consequently, integration of 
dual delivery with nanotechnology can hopefully produce successful therapeutic 
options for rheumatic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease involving 
persistent inflammation resulting in cartilage and bone damage. RA can affect 
the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and damage to the TMJ condyle can lead to 
craniofacial developmental disturbances, causing micrognathia, malocclusion, 
retrognathia, and increased overjet. Current treatments of TMJ arthritis are 
unsatisfactory. This pilot study aimed to investigate the effect of low 
intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the mandible and TMJ condyles in an RA 
mouse model using micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), histologic, and 
immunohistochemical analyses.
METHODS: MRL-lpr/lpr mice received LIPUS application to their TMJs for 
20 min/day for 2 and 4 weeks. Micro-CT analysis measured condylar length and 
width, posterior mandibular height (P.M.H), mandibular ramus length (M.R.L), 
effective mandibular length (Ef.M.L), angular process length (A.P.L), mandibular 
plane (M.P), mandibular axis (M.Ax), and lower incisor height (L.I.H). Condylar 
cartilage thickness was histologically measured, and type II collagen (Col-II), 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nuclear factor kappa-B ligand 
(RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression was analyzed using 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Comparing the LIPUS-treated group with the control, P.M.H, M.R.L, and 
M.P were significantly greater in the LIPUS-treated group. Immunostaining for 
Col-II and VEGF was stronger in the LIPUS-treated group after 4 weeks. OPG 
showed slightly more expression in the LIPUS group.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS may enhance mandibular and TMJ condylar bone formation in 
this RA mouse model by preventing any growth disturbances involved in 
inflammation. Further studies are recommended to analyze the effect of LIPUS on 
TMJ of RA in other animal models.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the ability of takinib, a selective transforming growth 
factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) inhibitor, to reduce the severity of 
murine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and to affect function of 
synovial cells.
METHODS: Following the induction of CIA, mice were treated daily with takinib 
(50 mg/kg) and clinical scores assessed. Thirty-six days post-CIA induction, 
histology was performed on various joints of treated and vehicle-treated 
animals. Inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, bone resorption, and periosteal 
bone formation were quantified. Furthermore, pharmacokinetics of takinib were 
evaluated by LC-MS in various tissues. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (RA-FLS) cells were cultured with 10 μM takinib and cytokine 
secretion analyzed by cytokine/chemokine proteome array. Cytotoxicity of takinib 
for RA-FLS was measured with 24 to 48 h cultures in the presence or absence of 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
RESULTS: Here, we show takinib's ability to reduce the clinical score in the CIA 
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (p < 0.001). TAK1 inhibition reduced 
inflammation (p < 0.01), cartilage damage (p < 0.01), pannus, bone resorption, 
and periosteal bone formation and periosteal bone width in all joints of treated 
mice compared to vehicle treated. Significant reduction of inflammation 
(p < 0.004) and cartilage damage (p < 0.004) were observed in the knees of 
diseased treated animals, with moderate reduction seen in the forepaws and hind 
paws. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of takinib show rapid plasma clearance 
(t½ = 21 min). In stimulated RA-FLS cells, takinib reduced GROα, G-CSF, and 
ICAM-1 pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that TAK1 targeted therapy 
represents a novel therapeutic axis to treat RA and other inflammatory diseases.

Osteoclasts (OCs) are bone-resorbing cells that originate from hematopoietic 
stem cells and develop through the fusion of mononuclear myeloid precursors. 
Dysregulation of OC development causes bone disorders such as osteopetrosis, 
osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although the molecular mechanisms 
underlying osteoclastogenesis have been well established, the means by which OCs 
maintain their survival during OC development remain unknown. We found that 
Ninjurin1 (Ninj1) expression is dynamically regulated during osteoclastogenesis 
and that Ninj1-/- mice exhibit increased trabecular bone volume owing to 
impaired OC development. Ninj1 deficiency did not alter OC differentiation, 
transmigration, fusion, or actin ring formation but increased 
Caspase-9-dependent intrinsic apoptosis in prefusion OCs (preOCs). 
Overexpression of Ninj1 enhanced the survival of mouse macrophage/preOC RAW264.7 
cells in osteoclastogenic culture, suggesting that Ninj1 is important for the 
survival of preOCs. Finally, analysis of publicly available microarray data sets 
revealed a potent correlation between high NINJ1 expression and destructive bone 
disorders in humans. Our data indicate that Ninj1 plays an important role in 
bone homeostasis by enhancing the survival of preOCs.

Triterpenoid saponins are the main bioactive components in Caulopphyllum 
Robustum Maxim (CRM), and they have been reported to have extensive 
pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and 
anti-tumor effects. Cauloside C, Cauloside D, Leonticin D and Cauloside H are 
the main active chemical constituents of CRM in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). However, their metabolic processes and products remain unclear. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the metabolic components and 
metabolic pathways of total saponins after oral administration of CRM effective 
part (CRME) in rats. In this work, we collected plasma, bile, urine and feces of 
rats at different sampling time points after intragastric administration. The 
saponins and reference substances were separated from CRME and analyzed via 
Thermo Scientific™ Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Orbitrap Elite 
Combined High resolution Mass Spectrometry. According to the structural 
characteristics of the compounds in CRM, the pyrolysis behavior of various 
components was inferred in the negative ion mode. Twenty-two components were 
found in rat plasma, bile, urine and stool; among these components, there were 8 
prototypes and 14 metabolites. Seven prototypes and 8 metabolites were found in 
rat plasma; no prototype and 6 metabolites were found in bile; 5 prototypes and 
8 metabolites were found in urine; and 4 prototypes and 9 metabolites were found 
in stool. The metabolites include deglycosylation products, sapogenin products, 
sulfides, and glucuronide conjugates. The same metabolites were also found in 
biological samples, and these products may be important metabolic pathways of 
triterpene saponins in rats. The current findings clarified the metabolic 
pathways of the main active ingredients in CRME and further elucidated the 
anti-RA drug-responsive substance basis of CRM.

Seventy years after the discovery of their anti-inflammatory properties, 
glucocorticoids (GCs) remain the mainstay treatment for major allergic and 
inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, 
colitis, and conjunctivitis, among others. However, their long-term 
therapeutical administration is limited by major debilitating side effects, 
e.g., skin atrophy, osteoporosis, Addison-like adrenal insufficiency, fatty 
liver, and type 2 diabetes syndrome, as well as growth inhibition in children. 
These undesirable side effects are mostly related to GC-induced activation of 
both the direct transactivation and the direct transrepression functions of the 
GC receptor (GR), whereas the activation of its GC-induced indirect tethered 
transrepression function results in beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. We 
have reported in the accompanying paper that the nonsteroidal compound CpdX as 
well as its deuterated form CpdX-D3 selectively activate the GR indirect 
transrepression function and are as effective as synthetic GCs at repressing 
inflammations generated in several mouse models of major pathologies. We now 
demonstrate that these CpdX compounds are bona fide selective GC receptor 
agonistic modulators (SEGRAMs) as none of the known GC-induced debilitating side 
effects were observed in the mouse upon 3-mo CpdX treatments. We notably report 
that, unlike that of GCs, the administration of CpdX to ovariectomized (OVX) 
mice does not induce a fatty liver nor type 2 diabetes, which indicates that 
CpdX could be used in postmenopausal women as an efficient "harmless" GC 
substitute.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic autoimmune disease mainly 
involving the formation of a synovial pannus, for which no effective treatment 
is available. In order to study the molecular biological mechanisms underlying 
the inhibition of RA synovial pannus by triptolide, differentially expressed 
genes in synovial tissues from an adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat model with and 
without triptolide treatment were detected in an mRNA microarray profile 
produced by Agilent Technologies and verified by reverse 
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-qPCR). An AA 
model was established by subcutaneously injecting 0.1 ml Freund's complete 
adjuvant daily for 18 days and scored by arthritis index assessment. 
Subsequently, triptolide (0.4 mg/kg) or an equivalent amount of saline was 
administered daily for 14 days. At the end of the experiment, synovial tissues 
were obtained from the ankle joints of the rats' hind legs. Total RNA was 
extracted and purified, and microarray hybridization was used to obtain the gene 
expression profile for RA with and without triptolide treatment. A total of 48 
genes were identified to be differentially expressed between the treatment and 
model groups, including 32 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes. The possible 
signaling pathways associated with the effect of triptolide were investigated by 
Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, revealing that the phosphoinositide-3 kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway has a key role in the proliferation and apoptosis 
of synovial cells in RA joints. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction analysis was applied to confirm the aberrant expression of key 
mRNAs and revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and C1q and 
tumor necrosis factor related protein 3 (C1QTNF3) were downregulated in the 
treatment group compared with the model group (P<0.05). In conclusion, 
triptolide may exert its effects against RA via the PI3K/AKT pathway and has an 
inhibitory effect on the expression of VEGFA and C1QTNF3, thus are potentially 
associated with the occurrence and development of RA.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas have attracted increasing attention 
worldwide in the past few years for treating complex disease including 
rheumatoid arthritis. However, their mechanisms are complex and remain unclear. 
Guan-Jie-Kang (GJK), a prescription modified from "Wu Tou Decoction," was found 
to significantly relieve arthritis symptoms in rats with adjuvant-induced 
arthritis after 30-day treatment, especially in the 24 g/kg/day group. By 
analyzing 1749 targets related to 358 compounds in the five herbs of GJK, we 
identified the possible anti-arthritis pathways of GJK, including the calcium 
signaling and metabolic pathways. Bone damage levels were assessed by 
micro-computed tomography, and greater bone protective effect was observed with 
GJK treatment than with methotrexate. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB 
ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling, which is related to calcium signaling, was 
significantly regulated by GJK. Moreover, a target metabolomics assay of serum 
was conducted; 17 metabolic biomarkers showed significant correlations with 
treatment. An integrated pathway analysis revealed that pyruvate metabolism, 
purine metabolism, and glycolysis metabolism were significantly associated with 
the effects of GJK in arthritis treatment. Thus, this study establishes a new 
omics analytical method integrated with bioinformatics analysis for elucidating 
the multi-pathway mechanisms of TCM.

RIP1 kinase regulates necroptosis and inflammation and may play an important 
role in contributing to a variety of human pathologies, including inflammatory 
and neurological diseases. Currently, RIP1 kinase inhibitors have advanced into 
early clinical trials for evaluation in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis and neurological diseases such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we report 
on the design of potent and highly selective dihydropyrazole (DHP) RIP1 kinase 
inhibitors starting from a high-throughput screen and the lead-optimization of 
this series from a lead with minimal rat oral exposure to the identification of 
dihydropyrazole 77 with good pharmacokinetic profiles in multiple species. 
Additionally, we identified a potent murine RIP1 kinase inhibitor 76 as a 
valuable in vivo tool molecule suitable for evaluating the role of RIP1 kinase 
in chronic models of disease. DHP 76 showed efficacy in mouse models of both 
multiple sclerosis and human retinitis pigmentosa.

Gancao Fuzi decoction (GFD) is a classic Chinese medicine formula for the 
treatment of rheumatic and rheumatoid arthritis. The main active components of 
GFD are alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins. This study aimed to clarify the 
pharmacodynamic effects of the active components in GFD and investigate the 
mechanism of them treating rheumatoid arthritis rats by the method of 
metabonomics. Seven groups were studied, named as the normal group (NG), the 
model group (MG), the Gancao Fuzi decoction treatment group (GFDe), the 
alkaloids group (ALK), the compatibility of alkaloids with flavonoids group 
(AF), the compatibility of alkaloids with saponins group (AS) and the 
compatibility of alkaloids with flavonoids and saponins group (AFS), 
respectively. Firstly, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of these 
groups were studied. Besides, urinary metabonomics based on ultra 
high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed for delineation of metabolic 
alterations in the rats. Based on our results, it is concluded that AFS showed 
better anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in GFD. Urinary metabonomic 
study and multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate the 
mechanism of different groups. 26 potential biomarkers have been identified. By 
the analysis of heat map combined with score plot, the AFS group was the closest 
group to the NG group after treatment in GFD. The changes of urinary endogenous 
metabolites showed that AFS exhibited better effect on regulating the taurine 
and hypotaurine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, TCA cycle, tryptophan 
metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, arginine and proline 
metabolism and purine metabolism pathways. The pharmacodynamics results showed 
that three components of flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids in GFD played an 
overall efficacy. Metabonomics studies showed that the compatibility of three 
components in GFD achieved the therapeutic effect by regulating the 
perturbations of multiple metabolic pathways.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a main characterized by persistent 
synovitis, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies. Tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is a crucial 
cytoplasm signal adaptor that can regulate critical biological processes. This 
research aims to explore the function of TRAF6 on bone loss and matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in collagen-induced RA rats.
METHODS: The RA model in rats (Sprague Dawley rat, 5-6 weeks old, weight 
246.88±8.31 g) was set up via using collagen-induced RA. The shRNA-TRAF6 
knockdown efficiency was tested using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively. The rats were divided 
into four groups: the control group, RA group, RA + shRNA-NC group, and RA + 
TRAF6-shRNA group. The tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP), hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E), and Saffron O staining were employed to test the bone injury. 
The mRNA and protein expressive of Osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), TRAP, 
Osterix (Osx), Collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), Distal-less homeobox2 (Dlx2), 
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1), 
Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and qRT-PCR performed MMP-13 and western blot, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of TRAF6 were down-regulated in 
the RA + TRAF6- shRNA group. After the levels of TRAF6 were inhibited, the 
levels of bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th), 
and trabecular bone number (Tb.N) were increased, while the levels of trabecular 
bone space (Tb.Sp), Osteocalcin and ALP were deceased. The mRNA and protein 
expression levels of OSCAR, TRAP, MMP-1, COX2, and MMP-13 were reduced obviously 
in the RA + TRAF6- shRNA group compared with the RA + shRNA-NC group, while the 
levels of TIMP-1, OSX, CoL1A1, and DLx2 were enhanced obviously.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TRAF6 reduces bone loss and MMP expression levels in 
collagen-induced RA rat, and supplies an alternative treatment method in RA.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most frequently occurring 
inflammatory arthritis. The present study was performed to characterize the role 
of microRNA-101-3p (miR-101-3p) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 
(PTGS2) in inflammation and biological activities of fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLSs) in RA.
METHODS: Initially, miR-101-3p and PTGS2 expression in RA tissues of RA patients 
and RA rats was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Rat model of type 
II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was adopted to simulate RA, followed by 
injection of miR-101-3p mimics or siRNA against PTGS2. Next, the apoptosis in 
synovial tissue and the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β and IL-6 
were identified. Subsequently, FLSs in RA (RA-FLSs) were isolated, after which 
in vitro experiments were conducted to analyze cell proliferation, apoptosis, 
migration and invasion upon treatment of up-regulated miR-101-3p and silenced 
PTGS2. Furthermore, the relationship of miR-101-3p and PTGS2 was determined by 
bioinformatics prediction and luciferase activity assay.
RESULTS: We identified poorly expressed miR-101-3p and highly expressed PTGS2 in 
synovial tissues of RA patients and RA rats, which showed reduced synoviocyte 
apoptosis and enhanced inflammation. In response to miR-101-3p mimics and 
si-PTGS2, the RA-FLSs were observed with attenuated cell proliferation, 
migration and invasion, corresponding to promoted apoptosis. Down-regulation of 
PTGS2 could rescue the effect of inhibited miR-101-3p in synovial injury and 
phenotypic changes of FLS in RA rats. Notably, miR-101-3p was found to 
negatively regulate PTGS2.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, miR-101-3p reduces the joint swelling and arthritis 
index in RA rats by down-regulating PTGS2, as evidenced by inhibited FLS 
proliferation and inflammation.

NR4A1-3 receptors are required in inflammatory disease initiation and 
progression, where they function as early response regulators, controlling the 
extent of the inflammatory response and promoting inflammatory resolution. NR4A 
receptor activity controls inflammatory processes in several diseases 
characterized by chronic inflammation including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
atherosclerosis. Studies indicate that cell-type and cellular microenvironment 
can alter NR4A1-3 receptor activity and influence their biological roles. Thus, 
the study of appropriate in vivo models of inflammatory disease is important to 
ascertain their cell- and tissue-specific functional roles. Here we describe 
immunohistochemical approaches optimized to study the expression patterns of 
NR4A nuclear receptors in inflamed synovium tissues obtained from patients 
diagnosed with RA and mouse models of inflammatory joint disease.

BACKGROUND: In the current investigation, the effects of the P2Y12 blocker 
ticagrelor, the sodium/glucose transporter-2-inhibitor empagliflozin, and the 
selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen were examined against rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA)/diabetes mellitus (DM)-co-morbidity-induced defects in vascular 
reactivity.
METHODS: After model setting, rats were allocated into a normal control, an 
RA/DM-co-morbidity, and three treatment groups receiving ticagrelor, 
empagliflozin and tamoxifen. Aorta tissue was isolated for enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot estimation of the pro-inflammatory 
molecules angiotensin-II (Ang-II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1), the adhesion 
molecules P-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the energy 
preserving molecule adenosine-5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), 
and the anti-inflammatory molecule vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). 
Estimations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 were performed immunohistochemically, together with 
histopathological examination using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome 
staining. An in vitro study on rat aortic strips was conducted to assess aorta 
vasorelaxation.
RESULTS: Ticagrelor, empagliflozin and tamoxifen significantly increased aorta 
tissue AMPK and eNOS and decreased Ang-II, ET-1, P-selectin, VCAM-1 and VIP 
levels compared with RA/DM-co-morbidity, coupled with improved acetylcholine 
vasorelaxation in vitro.
CONCLUSION: Ticagrelor, empagliflozin and tamoxifen may correct vascular 
reactivity defects, where modulation of vascular AMPK, eNOS, Ang-II, ET-1, 
P-selectin, VCAM-1 and MMP-2 underline their protective effects.

Compound 3R-(4'-hydroxyl-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl phenyl)-dihydro isocoumarin 
(GDC) is a natural isocoumarin, recently isolated from the stems of H. 
paniculiflorum. However, we know little about the effects of GDC on rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). This study aims to investigate the protective effects and 
potential mechanisms of GDC against LPS-induced inflammation in vitro. 
Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) obtained from synovial tissue of rats were 
induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with GDC. Cell viability was 
determined by 
mitochondrial-respiration-dependent3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
(MTT) assay. Secretion of various inflammatory mediators was analyzed by ELISA 
and RayBio® Rat Cytokine Antibody Array. Potential mechanisms that are 
associated with anti-inflammatory effect were examined by Western blot. Results 
showed that GDC significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- (IL-) 6 induced by LPS. GDC also reduced the 
expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, as 
well as proinflammatory cytokines such as activin A, ciliary neurotrophic factor 
(CNTF), fractalkine, IFN-γ, IL-4, and TIMP-1. Moreover, GDC inhibited 
LPS-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2), 
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and 
IκB. And GDC also blocked NF-κBp65 nuclear translocation. All the results 
suggested that the protective effects of GDC against LPS-induced inflammation in 
vitro may be related with NF-κB and JNK signaling pathway.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zicao is the dried root of Lithospermum 
erythrorhizon Sieb, et Zucc, Arnebia euchroma (Royle) Johnst, or Arnebia guttata 
Bunge and commonly used to treat viral infection, inflammation, arthritis and 
cancer in China.Shikonin (SKN) is a major active chemical component isolated 
from zicao. Previous research showed that SKN has anti-inflammatory, 
immunomodulatory and analgesic effects, and inhibits the development of 
arthritis and the condition of collagen arthritis (CIA) mice; nevertheless, its 
role in the angiogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been elucidated.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
antiangiogenic activity of SKN in CIA rats and various angiogenesis models.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anti-arthritic effect of SKN on CIA rats was tested by 
arthritis score, arthritis incidence, radiological observation and 
histopathology evaluation of inflamed joints. Vessel density evaluated with CD31 
immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence in joint synovial membrane tissues of 
CIA rats, chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, rat aortic ring assay, and the 
migration, invasion, adhesion and tube formation of human umbilical vein 
endothelial (HUVEC) cells induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were used to 
measured the antiangiogenenic activity of SKN. Moreover, the effect of SKN on 
the expression of angiogenic mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), VEGFR2, TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, platelet derived growth 
factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in sera and joint synovia 
of rats, and in TNF-α-induced MH7A/HUVEC cells were measured by 
immunohistochemistry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot and/or 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Through the analysis of protein and 
mRNA levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and PTEN, and the 
autophosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 in joint synovia of rats and in 
TNF-α-induced HUVEC cells, the molecular mechanism of its inhibition was 
elucidated by using Western blot and/or real-time PCR.
RESULTS: SKN significantly reduced the arthritis score and arthritis incidence, 
and inhibited inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage and bone destruction of 
inflamed joints in CIA rats. Partially, SKN remarkably decreased the immature 
blood vessels in synovial membrane tissues of inflamed joints from CIA rats. It 
also suppressed in vivo angiogenesis in chick embryo and VEGF165-induced 
microvessel sprout formation ex vivo. Meanwhile, SKN inhibited TNF-α-induced 
migration, invasion, adhesion and tube formation of HUVEC cells. Moreover, SKN 
significantly decreased the expression of angiogenic activators including VEGF, 
VEGFR2, TNF-α, IL-1β, PDGF and TGF-β in synovia of CIA rats and/or in MH7A/HUVEC 
cells. More interestingly, SKN downregulated PI3K and Akt, and simultaneously 
upregulated PTEN both at protein and mRNA levels in synovia tissues and/or in 
TNF-α-induced HUVEC cells. It also suppressed the phosphorylation and gene level 
of TNF-α-induced signaling molecules, as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in synovium and/or 
in TNF-α-induced HUVEC cells.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate for the first time that SKN has the 
anti-angiogenic effect in RA in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro by interrupting the 
PI3K/AKT and MAPKs signaling pathways.

Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) are a promising treatment modality for 
diseases caused by a breach in immune tolerance, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 
Current medication for these diseases is directed toward symptom suppression but 
no real cure is available yet. TolDC-based therapy aims to restore immune 
tolerance in an antigen-specific manner. Here we used a mouse model to address 
two major questions: (i) is a maturation stimulus needed for tolDC function in 
vitro and in vivo and is maturation required for functioning in experimental 
arthritis and (ii) can tolDCs modulate CD4+ T cell responses? To answer these 
questions, we compared matured and immature dexamethasone/vitamin D3-generated 
tolDCs in vitro. Subsequently, we co-transferred these tolDCs with naïve or 
effector CD4+ T cells to study the characteristics of transferred T cells after 
3 days with flow cytometry and Luminex multiplex assays. In addition, we tested 
the suppressive capabilities of tolDCs in an experimental arthritis model. We 
found that tolDCs cannot only modulate naïve CD4+ T cell responses as shown by 
fewer proliferated and activated CD4+ T cells in vivo, but also effector CD4+ T 
cells. In addition, Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) expansions were seen in the 
proliferating cell population in the presence of tolDCs. Furthermore, we show 
that administered tolDCs are capable to inhibit arthritis in the 
proteoglycan-induced arthritis model. However, a maturation stimulus is needed 
for tolDCs to manifest this tolerizing function in an inflammatory environment. 
Our data will be instrumental for optimization of future tolDC therapies for 
autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND: As dysregulation of immunometabolism plays a key role in the 
immunological diseases, dyslipidemia frequently observed in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) patients (60%) is associated with the disease activity and has been 
considered as the potential target of anti-inflammatory strategy. However, 
targeting of metabolic events to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics 
are far from clear as well as the mechanism of dyslipidemia in RA.
PURPOSE: To explore the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of silybin again RA 
through the regulation of lipid metabolism.
METHODS: Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model was used to examine the 
effects of silybin on modulating dysregulated lipid metabolism and arthritis. 
Metabolomics, docking technology, and biochemical methods such as western blots, 
qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining were performed to understanding the 
underlying mechanisms. Moreover, knock-down of LXRα and LXRα agonist were used 
on LO2 cell lines to understand the action of silybin.
RESULTS: We are the first to demonstrate that silybin can ameliorate 
dyslipidemia and arthritis in AIA rats. Overexpression of LXRα and several key 
lipogenic enzymes regulated by LXRα, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL), 
cholesterol 7α and 27α hydroxylase (CYP7A, CYP27A), adipocyte fatty acid-binding 
protein (aP2/FABP4) and fatty acid translocase (CD36/FAT), were observed in AIA 
rats, which mostly accounted for dyslipidemia during arthritis development. 
Metabolomics, docking technology, and biochemical results indicated that 
anti-arthritis effects of silybin related to suppressing the up-regulated LXRα 
and abnormal lipid metabolism. Notably, activation of LXRα could potentiate cell 
inflammatory process induced by LPS through the regulation of NF-κB pathway, 
however, suppression of LXRα agonism by siRNA or silybin reduced the nuclear 
translocation of NF-κB as well as the induction of downstream cytokines, 
indicating LXRα agonism is the important factor for the arthritis development 
and could be a potential target.
CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of LXRα can activate lipogenesis enzymes to worsen 
the inflammatory process in AIA rats as well as the development of dyslipidemia, 
therefore, rectifying lipid disorder via suppression of LXRα agonism pertains 
the capacity of drug target, which enables to discover and develop new drugs to 
treat rheumatoid arthritis with dyslipidaemia.

BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) infection causes periodontal disease 
and exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is reported that inoculation of 
periodontopathogenic bacteria (i.e., Pg) can alter gut microbiota composition in 
the animal models. Gut microbiota dysbiosis in human has shown strong 
associations with systemic diseases, including RA, diabetes mellitus, and 
inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, this study investigated 
dysbiosis-mediated arthritis by Pg oral inoculation in an experimental arthritis 
model mouse.
METHODS: Pg inoculation in the oral cavity twice a week for 6 weeks was 
performed to induce periodontitis in SKG mice. Concomitantly, a single 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of laminarin (LA) was administered to induce 
experimental arthritis (Pg-LA mouse). Citrullinated protein (CP) and IL-6 levels 
in serum as well as periodontal, intestinal, and joint tissues were measured by 
ELISA. Gut microbiota composition was determined by pyrosequencing the 16 s 
ribosomal RNA genes after DNA purification of mouse feces. Fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) was performed by transferring Pg-LA-derived feces to 
normal SKG mice. The effects of Pg peptidylarginine deiminase (PgPAD) on the 
level of citrullinated proteins and arthritis progression were determined using 
a PgPAD knockout mutant.
RESULTS: Periodontal alveolar bone loss and IL-6 in gingival tissue were induced 
by Pg oral infection, as well as severe joint destruction, increased arthritis 
scores (AS), and both IL-6 and CP productions in serum, joint, and intestinal 
tissues. Distribution of Deferribacteres and S24-7 was decreased, while CP was 
significantly increased in gingiva, joint, and intestinal tissues of 
Pg-inoculated experimental arthritis mice compared to experimental arthritis 
mice without Pg inoculation. Further, FMT from Pg-inoculated experimental 
arthritis mice reproduced donor gut microbiota and resulted in severe joint 
destruction with increased IL-6 and CP production in joint and intestinal 
tissues. The average AS of FMT from Pg-inoculated experimental arthritis was 
much higher than that of donor mouse. However, inoculation of the PgPAD knockout 
mutant inhibited the elevation of arthritis scores and ACPA level in serum and 
reduced CP amount in gingival, joint, and intestinal tissues compared to Pg 
wild-type inoculation.
CONCLUSION: Pg oral infection affected gut microbiota dysbiosis and joint 
destruction via increased CP generation.

BACKGROUND: The autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 
approximately 1% of the global population. RA is characterized with chronic 
joint inflammation and often associated with chronic pain. The imbalance of 
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages is a feature of RA 
progression. Glial cells affecting neuronal sensitivity at both peripheral and 
central levels may also be important for RA progression and associated pain. 
Genetic variants in the T cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) locus are found 
to associate with spondyloarthritis. TDAG8 was also found involved in RA disease 
progression and associated hyperalgesia in the RA mouse model. However, its 
modulation in RA remains unclear.
METHODS: To address this question, we intra-articularly injected complete 
Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into TDAG8+/+, TDAG8-/- or wild-type mice, followed by 
pain behavioral tests. Joints and dorsal root ganglia were taken, sectioned, and 
stained with antibodies to observe the number of immune cells, macrophages, and 
satellite glial cells (SGCs). For compound treatments, compounds were 
intraperitoneally or orally administered weekly for 9 consecutive weeks after 
CFA injection.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that TDAG8 deletion slightly reduced RA pain in the 
early phase but dramatically attenuated RA progression and pain in the chronic 
phase (> 7 weeks). TDAG8 deletion inhibited an increase in SGC number and 
inhibition of SGC function attenuated chronic phase of RA pain, so TDAG8 could 
regulate SGC number to control chronic pain. TDAG8 deletion also reduced M1 
pro-inflammatory macrophage number at 12 weeks, contributing to the attenuation 
of chronic RA pain. Such results were further confirmed by using salicylanilide 
derivatives, CCL-2d or LCC-09, to suppress TDAG8 expression and function.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TDAG8 deletion reduced SGC and M1 
macrophage number to relieve RA disease severity and associated chronic pain. M1 
macrophages are critical for the development and maintenance of RA disease and 
pain, but glial activation is also required for the chronic phase of RA pain.

The tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from palm oil contains vitamin E, which 
possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) is a chronic joint inflammatory disease characterised by severe 
joint pain, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion owing to the effects of 
various pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Here, we investigated the 
therapeutic effects of TRF in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
Arthritis was induced by a single intradermal injection of collagen type II in 
Dark Agouti (DA) rats. Rats were then treated with or without TRF by oral gavage 
from day 28 after the first collagen injection. Arthritic rats supplemented with 
TRF showed decreased articular index scores, ankle circumferences, paw volumes, 
and radiographic scores when compared with untreated rats. The untreated 
arthritic rats showed higher plasma C-reactive protein levels (p < 0.05) and 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines than arthritic rats fed TRF. Moreover, 
there was a marked reduction in the severity of histopathological changes 
observed in arthritic rats treated with TRF compared with that in untreated 
arthritic rats. Overall, the results show that TRF had beneficial effects in 
this rat model of RA.

BACKGROUND: Improved knowledge of different biomarkers is crucial for early 
diagnosis of rheumatic diseases and to provide important insights for clinical 
management. In this study, we evaluated the seroreactivity of patients with 
different connective tissue diseases (CTDs) (rheumatoid arthritis, RA; systemic 
lupus erythematosus, SLE; systemic sclerosis, SSc; and Sjogren's syndrome, SSj) 
to interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) peptide and homologs derived from 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). 
Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) experiments have been performed in control and 
IRF5 conditional knockout mice to reinforce the hypothesis that antibodies 
generated against the three homologous peptides are cross-reactive.
METHODS: Reactivity against wild-type (wt) and citrullinated (cit) IRF5 
(IRF5424-434), MAP (MAP_402718-32) and EBV (BOLF1305-320) peptides were tested 
by indirect ELISA in sera from 100 RA patients, 54 patients with other CTDs (14 
SLE, 28 SSc and 12 SSj) and 100 healthy subjects (HCs). Antibody responses to 
the same wt peptides have been tested in AIA mouse sera after immunization with 
complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA) and methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) to 
induce arthritis in the knee joint.
RESULTS: BOLF1, MAP_4027 and IRF5 peptides triggered different antibody 
responses in CTD diseases with a stronger reactivity in RA (p=0.0001). Similar 
trends were observed in AIA mice with significantly higher reactivity after 7 
days from induction of arthritis. We also found statistically significant 
differences in antibody responses between SSc and HCs for BOLF1 (p=0.003), 
MAP_4027 (p=0.0076) and IRF5 (p=0.0042). Peripheral reactivity to cit peptides 
was lower compared to their wt counterparts, except for cit-MAP_402718-32, which 
induced stronger responses in RA than wt-MAP_402718-32 (46% vs. 26%, p=0.0170). 
Conclusion(s): Our results show differential antibody responses to BOLF1, 
MAP_4027 and IRF5 peptides among CTDs, highlighting their potential as 
diagnostic biomarkers in these diseases. Experiments performed in IRF5 
conditional knockout mice support the hypothesis of cross-reactivity between the 
investigated homologous antigens.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects joints and 
induces pain and swelling. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of step 
electrical stimulation (SES) in this study. SES was carried out by increasing 
the voltage (3 V/s) from 5 V to 100 V for 60 cycles. The viability of mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) was evaluated after step-electrical stimulation. 
After the injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on the right hind paw of 
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (6 weeks old), the degree of swelling was measured 
using a digital plethysmometer and Vernier caliper. Histological changes in 
inflamed tissues were observed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, while 
the degree of inflammation was evaluated from the expression level of 
inflammatory factors such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). As a result, we found no difference in cell 
viability after SES treatment between the control and SES-treated groups. On day 
21 after CFA injection, the swelling of right hind paws decreased by 1.09 times 
in SES-treated group as compared with the untreated group. In addition, the 
levels of COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 significantly decreased after SES treatment. 
Thus, SES treatment decreased paw swelling and alleviated inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Proper blocking of toll-like receptor (TLR) activation during 
disease progression has been reported to have inhibitory effect on the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We tested whether the TLR4 inhibitor 
TAK-242 had potential as a remedy for rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: The therapeutic effect of TAK-242 was tested in vitro using the human 
rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) line MH7A or primary human FLS and 
in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model.
RESULTS: TAK-242 dose dependently inhibited the increased expression of IL-6, 
IL-8, MMP-1, and VEGF in LPS-stimulated MH7A cells. It also inhibited the 
expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in poly(I:C), TLR3 activator-stimulated primary FLS, 
but not in IL-1β-stimulated primary FLS. These findings suggest that TAK-242 
blocks a specific signaling pathway to some degree. Further, TAK-242 slightly 
inhibited mobilization of NF-κB into nuclei. In the AIA rat model, TAK-242 
significantly reversed the body weight and paw thickness of AIA rats to the 
normal state at a dose of 5 mg/kg, but not at 3 mg/kg, and reduced the increased 
serum level of IL-6 and VEGF in AIA rats. It also significantly ameliorated 
inflammatory symptoms of joint tissues at day 21 of treatment, according to 
histology and RT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the drug repositioning concept, TAK-242, which is used for 
the treatment of TLR4-mediated inflammatory diseases, shows potential for 
cost-effective development as a remedy for rheumatoid arthritis or to control 
the progression of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that affects 1-2% of the 
human population worldwide, and effective therapies with targeted delivery for 
local immune suppression have not been described. We address this problem by 
developing a novel theranostic nanoparticle for RA and assessed its therapeutic 
and targeting effects under image-guidance. Methods: Albumin-cerium oxide 
nanoparticles were synthesized by the biomineralization process and further 
conjugated with near-infrared, indocyanine green (ICG) dye. Enzymatic-like 
properties and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities, as well as 
the ability to reprogram macrophages, were determined on a monocyte cell line in 
culture. The therapeutic effect and systemic targeting potential were evaluated 
in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model using optical/optoacoustic 
tomographic imaging. Results: Small nanotheranostics with narrow size 
distribution and high colloidal stability were fabricated and displayed high ROS 
scavenging and enzymatic-like activity, as well as advanced efficacy in a 
converting pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype into anti-inflammatory 
phenotype. When administrated into affected animals, these nanoparticles 
accumulated in inflamed joints and revealed a therapeutic effect similar to the 
gold-standard therapy for RA, methotrexate. Conclusions: The 
inflammation-targeting, inherent contrast and therapeutic activity of this new 
albumin-cerium oxide nanoparticle may make it a relevant agent for assessing 
severity in RA, and other inflammatory diseases, and controlling inflammation 
with image-guidance. The design of these nanotheranostics will enable potential 
clinical translation as systemic therapy for RA.

BACKGROUND: Podocyte infolding glomerulopathy (PIG) is a rare histopathologic 
finding with global infolding of the podocytes into the glomerular basement 
membrane (GBM), accompanied by microstructures underneath. Described in 2002 for 
the first time, PIG was proposed as a new pathological entity in 2008 based on 
the largest case series so far. Yet all of the described cases derive from Asian 
countries. We report a case from Germany fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of 
PIG. Considering the scarcity of data on this entity especially in Western 
countries, collecting cases like ours and multicentric meta-analyses will be 
crucial to obtain a better understanding of PIG, its causes, clinical course and 
potential treatment options.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), no other comorbidities and no known renal disease was admitted 
to the hospital with acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephrotic syndrome. Physical 
examination was unremarkable except for anasarca. Renal ultrasound revealed no 
abnormalities. Laboratory and urine analyses were consistent with the nephrotic 
syndrome and renal failure. Serological studies regarding ANA, ANCA, anti-PLA2R 
autoantibodies, complement, virus infections, immunofixation and quantitative 
light chain analysis were unremarkable. A renal biopsy was performed. Light 
microscopic examination showed flattened tubular epithelium consistent with 
acute tubular damage, no infiltrates and unremarkable glomeruli except diffuse 
and global holes in the GBM (Fig. 1a) and negative staining for immunoglobulin 
heavy-chains, light-chains and complement split products. Electron microscopy 
revealed a rare correlate for these holes: global peculiar infolding of podocyte 
cytoplasm into the GBM. Most of these infoldings were accompanied by 
condensation of the GBM underneath. No such condensation or electron dense 
deposits were found without these infoldings or outside the GBM.
CONCLUSION: Here we report the first case of PIG outside of Asia. Since there 
are only few reports about this specific finding, we feel there is a need to 
share information in an attempt to accumulate knowledge about this possible new 
entity and potential treatment options.

The human immune system has evolved in the context of our colonisation by 
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasitic helminths. Reflecting this, the rapid 
eradication of pathogens appears to have resulted in reduced microbiome 
diversity and generation of chronically activated immune systems, presaging the 
recent rise of allergic, autoimmune and metabolic disorders. Certainly, 
gastrointestinal helminths can protect against gut and lung mucosa inflammatory 
conditions by modulating the microbiome and suppressing the chronic inflammation 
associated with dysbiosis. Here, we employ ES-62, an immunomodulator secreted by 
tissue-dwelling Acanthocheilonema viteae to show that helminth-modulation of the 
gut microbiome does not require live infection with gastrointestinal-based worms 
nor is protection restricted to mucosal diseases. Specifically, subcutaneous 
administration of this defined immunomodulator affords protection against joint 
disease in collagen-induced arthritis, a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, 
which is associated with normalisation of gut microbiota and prevention of loss 
of intestinal barrier integrity.

Our recent study has implicated bradykinin (BK) signaling as being of pathogenic 
importance in lupus. This study aims to investigate the biomarker potential of 
BK peptides, BK and BK-des-arg-9, in lupus and other rheumatic autoimmune 
diseases. Sera from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy 
subjects were screened for BK and BK-des-arg-9 by liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry metabolomics. Serum from 6-mo-old C57BL/6 mice and three murine 
lupus strains were also screened for the two peptides by metabolomics. Given the 
promising initial screening results, validation of these two peptides was next 
conducted using multiple reaction monitoring in larger patient cohorts. In 
initial metabolomics screening, BK-des-arg-9 was 22-fold higher in SLE serum and 
106-fold higher in mouse lupus serum compared with healthy controls. In 
validation assays using multiple reaction monitoring and quadrupole 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry, BK and BK-des-arg-9 showed significant 
elevations in SLE serum compared with controls (p < 0.0001; area under the curve 
= 0.79-0.88), with a similar but less pronounced increase being noted in 
rheumatoid arthritis serum. Interestingly, increased renal SLE disease activity 
index in lupus patients was associated with reduced circulating BK-des-arg-9, 
and the reasons for this remain to be explored. To sum, increased conversion of 
BK to the proinflammatory metabolite BK-des-arg-9 appears to be a common theme 
in systemic rheumatic diseases. Besides serving as an early marker for systemic 
autoimmunity, independent studies also show that this metabolic axis may also be 
a pathogenic driver and therapeutic target in lupus.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-standing and growing autoimmune disease. 
Therefore, the present study was intended to investigate the effect of 
Corynoline (COR) on CFA induced rheumatoid arthritis in a rat model. Results 
suggested that COR causes significant reduction in paw swelling, edema, 
arthritis score, thymus and spleen indexes and neutrophil infiltration 
(p < 0.01). Moreover, the levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 1β, -6, 
and -17, and TNF-α) and anti-collagen II-specific immunoglobulins (IgG1 and 
IgG2a) were decreased significantly (p < 0.01) together with increase in 
antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH) (p < 0.01) in COR-treated group in 
dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, COR-treated group showed 
concentration-dependent reduction of expression of COX-2, 5-LOX and NF-p65 as 
compared to CFA rats. Moreover, COR-treated group showed mild inflammation of 
cartilage with fewer cartilage erosion and synovititis with most significant 
reversal of arthritic features in the rats treated with 30 mg/kg. It has been 
concluded that, COR alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation in arthritic 
rats, thus verifying its anti-rheumatoid arthritis property.

TSPO is up-regulated in activated macrophages, and serves as an attractive 
target for macrophages molecular imaging and therapy. MRI may be an ideal 
technique in the clinical management of RA due to its excellent spatial 
resolution. In the present study, a novel TSPO-targeting MRI contrast agent was 
developed by conjugating a novel TSPO ligand CB86 with gadolinium chelate to 
visualise inflamed regions in RA mice model. A novel TSPO ligand CB86 was linked 
to DTPAA, followed by chelation with gadolinium to obtain MRI targeted contrast 
agent CB86-DTPA-Gd. CB86-DTPA-Gd was characterised by MRI relaxivity, cell 
cytotoxicity, cell specificity and in vitro stability analysis. The distribution 
and MRI intensity was evaluated in RA rat model. Synthesis of CB86-DTPA-Gd was 
completed successfully with MRI relaxivity of 11.05/mM/sec (9.4 T, 25 °C). 
CB86-DTPA-Gd exhibited a good stability in human serum, high RAW264.7 cells 
specificity and no cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 cells. The biodistribution and MRI 
studies showed that the accumulation and signal intensity of CB86-DTPA-Gd in the 
right RA ankles was higher and stronger than those of Gd‑DTPA. This study 
demonstrates that CB86-DTPA-Gd can identify phagocytic active macrophages in the 
synovial joints, and has potential as a promising targeting MRI contrast agent 
for imaging of peripheral inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by inflammatory cells in 
lesions is the hallmark of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Regulation of inflammatory responses in knee joints of patients with RA is 
critical for improving severe symptoms. Flavonoids have inhibitory effects on 
the acute and chronic inflammatory responses caused by TNF-α. The flavonoid 
quercetin (QUER) is one of the most prominent dietary antioxidants.
OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the preventive and therapeutic effects 
of QUER on inflammatory responses in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.
METHODS: Mice with CIA, a mouse model for RA, were treated with QUER orally 
three times a week either from the second immunization with collagen (day 21) or 
day 28 when symptoms of CIA had developed midway.
RESULTS: In both cases, inflammation-related clinical scores of knee joints were 
significantly reduced by treatment with QUER. Histological analyses showed that 
the representative characteristics of RA, such as damage to interchondral 
joints, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and pannus formation, were 
significantly reduced by QUER treatment. Oral administration of QUER 
significantly decreases lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-α production in a 
dose-dependent manner. Expression of TNF- α mRNA in knee joints was decreased in 
QUER-treated mice, compared with those of CIA controls.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oral administration of QUER might 
effectively improve symptoms of RA.

Background Natural anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals may be useful in suppressing 
the incessant aggravation of rheumatoid arthritis. Chia seeds as a natural 
source of antioxidants help prevent several oxidative stress-mediated diseases. 
The current study was focused on arthritis combined with obesity and evaluated 
the validation of oil and mucilage extracted from chia seeds as 
anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals in obese and non-obese adjuvant arthritic rat 
model. Methods Chia seeds oil was extracted by pressing method, whereas the 
mucilage was extracted using water (50 °C for 30 min). Oil and freeze-dried 
mucilage were tested for their anti-inflammatory effects using 48 male 
Sprague-Dawley rats. Obesity was developed in rats after 8 weeks of feeding on 
high-fat high-sucrose diet; on the first day of the ninth week, chia seeds oil 
and mucilage were administrated for 21 days, and arthritis was induced either in 
obese or non-obese rats via the injection with Freund's complete adjuvant. 
Swelling of the paw was then measured. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), 
lipid profile, liver and kidney functions, serum lipid peroxidation, and 
erythrocyte catalase activity were determined. Results Results emphasized that 
arthritis with obesity resulted in the elevation of the swelling of the paw, 
TNF-α, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress. Chia seeds oil and mucilage, more 
promisingly the oil, attenuated TNF-α and the swelling of the paw, improved 
lipid profile, and diminished the oxidative stress both in obese and non-obese 
arthritic rats. Conclusions Results showed that chia seeds oil and mucilage 
exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against adjuvant-induced arthritis in obese 
and non-obese rats.

Multicompound determination for the quality control of traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) may often be inadequate, since these compounds may not be 
associated with, or fully represent, the clinical effects of TCM. Moreover, the 
individual contributions of each constituent to the pharmacological effect are 
often not considered. In China, Porana sinensis is widely used as a substitute 
for Erycibe sources to treat joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis. The existing 
quality control methods for P. sinensis neither consider the individual 
contributions of various compounds nor control the actual quality associated 
with different clinical efficacies. In the present study, a novel 
efficacy-oriented approach, named the effect-constituent index (ECI), was 
established for P. sinensis. Analyses of the spectrum-effect relationship and 
components in rat plasma were conducted to systematically and scientifically 
select quality markers. Quantitative analysis of multicomponents via a single 
marker method was introduced to enhance the practical application value of the 
established ECI. The established ECI shows a good ability to distinguish and 
predict the bioeffect-based quality of P. sinensis. The present study also 
provides a reference for the establishment and application of ECI as a quality 
control method for TCMs.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Though cyclooxygenase inhibitors are employed in rheumatoid 
arthritis treatment, modulators of leukotrienes are underexplored. We 
investigated the therapeutic potential of montelukast, a known cysteinyl 
leukotriene receptor-1 (CysLT1) inhibitor in an experimental rat model of 
arthritis.
METHODS: Arthritis was induced in rats, and montelukast (5 mg/kg body wt.) was 
administered prophylactically (PAM) and therapeutically (TAM) through oral 
route.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Blood and joint tissue markers of oxidative stress 
(lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls, and nitric oxides) were significantly 
(p < 0.05) reduced in montelukast administered rats. Paw inflammation, RA 
markers (RF and CRP), eicosanoids (PGE2, LTB4, and LTC4), cytokines (IL-1β and 
MCP-1), activity of hydrolytic enzymes (collagenase, elastase, and 
hyaluronidase), expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and EP-4 receptor 
were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in montelukast administered rats. This 
study established that leukotriene inhibition through montelukast lowered the 
severity of arthritis and thus a potential strategy for reducing the severity of 
arthritis.

Abundant reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) cytokine 
supply of M1-type macrophages boost rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathological 
process. For efficient RA therapy, here a multifunctional nanoplatform is 
presented based on generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimer-entrapped gold 
nanoparticles (Au DENPs) to achieve co-delivery of antioxidant alpha-tocopheryl 
succinate (α-TOS) and anti-inflammatory anti-TNF-α siRNA to macrophage cells. G5 
dendrimers with amine termini are sequentially functionalized with 1,3-propane 
sultone (1,3-PS), α-TOS through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, and 
PEGylated folic acid (FA), and subsequently entrapped with Au NPs. The generated 
functional Au DENPs exhibit desired cytocompatibility, zwitterion-rendered 
antifouling property, and FA-mediated targeting specificity, enabling 
serum-enhanced siRNA delivery to M1-type macrophage cells. Meanwhile, the 
attached α-TOS affords enhanced oxidation resistance of macrophage cells. In 
vivo investigation shows that the treatment of a collagen-induced arthritis 
mouse model using α-TOS-modified Au DENPs/TNF-α siRNA polyplexes can achieve 
excellent combination therapy effect in inflammatory cytokines downregulation of 
RA lesion and bone erosions. The therapeutic efficacy is also supported by 3D 
micro-computed tomography analysis and TNF-α cytokine reduction of RA lesion 
joints in the mRNA, protein, and histology levels. The created multifunctional 
nanoplatform may be employed in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory combination 
therapy of RA.

Wang-Bi tablet (WB) is popularly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
However, few studies have been carried out on its active ingredients and 
mechanism. In this study, the effect of WB medicated serum on the changes in 
differentiation and function in osteoblast was investigated, the results showed 
that WB induced the production of ALP and mineralized nodules to promote the 
final maturation of osteoblasts and enhance the function of osteoblasts. The 
potential mechanism may that WB significantly inhibits gene expressions of RANKL 
and miR-141, up-regulates the gene expressions of RUNX2 and OPG, decreases 
expression of DKK-1 and increases levels of β-catenin protein to promote the 
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which enhances osteogenesis and 
bone repair function. To investigate which compounds contributed to the activity 
and mechanisms, a total of 138 compounds were characterized from WB, and 13 
parent molecules and eight metabolites in rat serum were rapidly characterized 
by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Total glycosides of paeony, loganin, α-linolenic acid, 
linoleic acid and naringin from WB may contribute to the actions on osteoblasts 
according to our study and literature review. Our research provides a method to 
explore the bioactive ingredients and action mechanisms of WB.

Anti-inflammatory cytokines are a promising class of therapeutics for treatment 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their use is currently limited by a rapid 
clearance and systemic toxicity. Interleukin-4 is a small cytokine with 
potential for RA therapy. To increase its pharmacokinetic features, we 
engineered a murine IL4 conjugate by incorporating an unnatural amino acid 
through genetic code expansion to which PEG-folate, as a targeting moiety and 
PEG alone as control, were site-specifically bound. Both IL4 conjugates retained 
bioactivity and induced primary murine macrophage polarization into an 
alternatively activated (M2) related phenotype. The PEGylated conjugates had a 
terminal half-life of about four hours in healthy mice compared to unPEGylated 
IL4 (0.76 h). We showed that both conjugates successfully accumulated into 
arthritic joints in an antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) mouse model, as assessed 
by non-invasive fluorescence imaging. The modular nature of the IL4 conjugate 
chemistry presented herein facilitates easy adaption of PEG chain length and 
targeting moieties for further improvement of half-life and targeting function 
for future efficacy studies.

Angelicae pubescentis radix (APR) is widely applied in treating rheumatoid 
arthritis in China. Coumarins are the major active compounds of APR extract 
including columbianetin, columbianetin acetate, osthole, and columbianadin. The 
in vivo behavior of the four major coumarins of APR has not been systematically 
reported. A feasible and reliable ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) 
method was established and validated for the quantification of the above four 
coumarins in rat various tissues (including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, 
uterus, ovary, and muscle) after oral administration of APR extract. The 
separation was implemented on a Waters ACQUITY BEH C18 column (4.6 mm × 100 mm, 
1.7 μm) with gradient mobile phase comprising acetonitrile-water (with 1mM 
formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The tissue homogenate samples were 
prepared by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. The calibration curves 
were linear in the range of 1.6-20000 ng/mL for four coumarins with the lower 
limit of quantitation of 1.6 ng/mL in rat tissues. The intraday and interday 
precisions and recoveries were all within 80-100% with the relative standard 
deviations (RSDs) which were all less than 10.9%. The method was successfully 
applied to the tissue distribution research after oral administration of 6.0 
g/kg APR extract to rat. The results revealed that the tissues distributions of 
four coumarins were in the liver, followed by the ovary, uterus, kidney, lung, 
heart, spleen, and muscle.

TRADITIONAL PERTINENCE: Argyreia speciosa Sweet (Linn.), belongs to the family 
convolvulaceae, a traditional Indian medicinal herb, has been used to treat 
acute/chronic ulcers, gonorrhea, rheumatoid arthritis and several nervous 
disorders having a long history.
AIM OF THE STUDY: A broad spectrum approach of this work was to find out the 
antioxidant activity of Argyreia speciosa seeds, in vitro and in vivo 
antioxidant assay were performed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC), reducing power (RP), 
antioxidant activity (AOA), O2·- (superoxide anion), DPPḢ 
(1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and ˙OH (hydroxyl) radicals scavenging 
activities, GSH (glutathione), CAT (catalase), SOD (superoxide dismutase) and 
LPO (lipid peroxidase) are the major parameters which were studied for 
determining in vitro and in vivo antioxidant property of seed extract & their 
six fractions obtained from A. speciosa. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced rat 
model was used to determine in vivo antioxidant assay of extract and its 
fractions.
RESULTS: Butanol fraction (AS-BF) showed strong antioxidant property and 
protected oxidative DNA damage. AS-BF was found best as compared to all other 
fraction for determining antioxidant property of seeds with the reduction in 
lipid peroxide formation and increment in GSH, CAT and SOD. AS-BF showed the 
presence of phenolic compounds viz. gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic 
acid.
CONCLUSION: From these results, it was proved that A. speciosa seeds prevent 
tissue damage due to oxidative stress with strong antioxidant activity.

Purpose: Micro-computed tomography (µCT) is increasingly being used on animal 
models as a minimally-invasive longitudinal outcome measure of pulmonary disease 
progression. However, while imaging can elucidate macroscopic structural changes 
over the whole lung, µCT is unable to describe the mechanical changes and 
functional impairments imposed by progressive disease, which can only be 
measured via pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The tumor necrosis 
factor-transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develops 
pulmonary pathology that mimics many aspects of the inflammatory interstitial 
lung disease (ILD) seen in a subset of patients with RA. Prior studies using µCT 
imaging of these mice found increased pulmonary density, characteristic of 
restrictive disease; however, there have been conflicting reports in the 
literature regarding the obstructive versus restrictive phenotype of this model. 
Our study looks to 1) define the functional impairments and 2) characterize the 
restrictive/obstructive nature of the disease found in this model. Materials and 
Methods: In this study, we performed PFTs at end-stage ILD, and paired these 
findings with µCT results, correlating radiology to functional parameters. 
TNF-Tg and WT littermates of both sexes underwent µCT imaging and PFT testing at 
5.5 months-old. Spearman's correlation analyses were performed comparing lung 
tissue volume (LTV) to PFT parameters of gas exchange and tissue stiffness. 
Results: Compared to WT, TNF-Tg mice had impaired gas exchange capacity, 
increased respiratory resistance, and reduced lung compliance, elastance, and 
inspiratory capacity, indicating increased tissue stiffness and compromised 
pulmonary function. LTV was also consistently higher in TNF-Tg lungs. 
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that: 1) TNF-Tg mice display a 
restrictive pathology, and 2) in vivo µCT is a valid outcome measure to infer 
changes in pulmonary mechanical and functional parameters.

The goal of the current investigation was to prepare PEGylated Lipova E120 
liposomes loaded with celecoxib for the effective treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). PEGylated liposomes were prepared and were characterized using 
techniques such as particle size distribution, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta 
potential, encapsulation efficiency and in-vitro release, in-vivo and stability 
studies. The morphological study was characterized by scanning electron 
microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. To determine the interaction 
between drug and polymer Fourier transform infrared, Raman, thermogravimetric 
analysis and differential scanning calorimetry studies were performed. Results 
show that formulation F6 was optimized with a particle size of 92.12 +/- 1.7 nm, 
a PDI of 0.278 +/- 0.22, a zeta potential of - 40.8 +/- 1.7 mV with a maximum 
encapsulation of 96.6 +/- 0.05% of drug in the PEGylated liposomes. The 
optimized formulation shows a maximum release of drug i.e. 94.45 +/- 1.13% in 72 
h. Tail immersion assay shows that the optimized formulation F6 significantly 
increases the reaction time and carrageenan-induced assay shows that the 
optimized formulation inhibits the increase in paw edema thus providing a pain 
relief treatment in RA. These results suggest that the PEGylated liposomes 
provide a sustained release of celecoxib and helps in effective treatment of RA.

BACKGROUND: We report a case of prosthetic hip joint infection in a heart 
transplant recipient due to Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens, a genus of 
spiral-shaped curved anaerobic gram-negative rod which colonizes the 
gastrointestinal tract of cats and dogs. Invasive infections in humans are rare 
and typically occur in immunocompromised hosts.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old male dog breeder with a history of rheumatoid 
arthritis, bilateral hip arthroplasties, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a 
heart transplant 10 years ago presented with a three month history of 
progressive left hip pain and frank purulence on hip aspiration. He underwent 
irrigation and debridement of the left hip and one-stage revision with hardware 
exchange. Although gram stain and culture from synovial fluid and intraoperative 
cultures were initially negative, anaerobic cultures from tissue specimens later 
grew a spiral-shaped gram-negative rod, identified as Anaerobiospirillum spp. by 
16S rRNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 
6 weeks with a good response to treatment. A similar organism was unable to be 
isolated from culture of 2 of the patient's dogs, however, they were thought to 
be the most likely source of his infection.
CONCLUSION: Anaerobiospirillum spp. should be considered in immunocompromised 
patients with exposure to dogs or cats who present with bacteremia, 
gastrointestinal infection, pyomyositis, or prosthetic joint infections, 
especially in cases of culture-negative or with anaerobic culture growth.

BACKGROUND: The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine that produced 
principally by monocyte/macrophages and T lymphocytes, respectively. TNFα is 
recognized as the primary mediator of immunity in inflammation reaction. One 
important application of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2) is for the 
treatment of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to examine the therapeutic trace of the 
recombinant humanTNFR2 on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CIA was created in 20 mice by immunization with bovine 
type II collagen (CII). After the mice were boosted on day 21, they were 
injected with the recombinant protein in test group (1 mg.kg-1) and assessed 
edema in paws and knee joints after two weeks. The quantities of inflammatory 
cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1 beta (IL-β1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 
interleukin-10(IL-10) in serum were evaluated through enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. In addition, the histopathology of joints 
sections was analyzed.
RESULTS: The cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 values in serum markedly decreased 
in groups treated with TNFR2 (P < 0.01-0.001). The results showed that treatment 
with TNFR2 significantly reduced edema in paws and joints (P < 0.01-0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pathological investigations proved that administration of 
recombinant TNF receptor has blocked or protected joints from progressive 
damage. This study suggests that the anti-arthritic effectiveness of TNFR2 will 
repress the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, it seems that TNFR2 is a 
strong candidate for the treatment of the RA disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
synovial inflammation and joint destruction. Although great progress has been 
made in the treatment of RA with antagonists of pro-inflammatory cytokines such 
as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1, the disease remains refractory in some patients. 
Previous studies have found that small-molecule inflammatory mediators, such as 
prostaglandins, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, lipoxins 
and platelet-activating factor, play a significant role in the development of 
RA. Such compounds help to induce, maintain or reduce inflammation and could 
therefore be potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we describe the 
roles of various classes of small-molecule inflammatory mediators in RA and 
discuss the effects of some drugs that modulate their activity. Many drugs 
targeting these mediators have demonstrated good efficacy in mouse models of RA 
but not in patients. However, it is clear that many small-molecule inflammatory 
mediators play key roles in the pathogenesis of RA, and a better understanding 
of the underlying molecular pathways may assist in the development of targeted 
therapies that are efficacious in RA patients.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Suvarna Bhasma is a gold-based Ayurved medicine 
that has a wide range of therapeutic indications like tuberculosis, diabetes 
mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and nervous diseases. Suvarna Bhasma is also used 
in Suvarnaprashana, an Ayurved advocated therapy being practised to improve 
immunity in children.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To augment traditional understanding, here we present an 
evidence-based study on Suvarna Bhasma regarding its physicochemical properties, 
toxicity and efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suvarna Bhasma was characterised by physicochemical 
characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic 
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Toxicity of Suvarna Bhasma was studied in 
Holtzman rats with daily oral dose from 3 mg/kg (therapeutic dose, TD) up to 
30 mg/kg (10 TD) body weight for 90 days. Behavioural study, such as motor and 
geotactic behaviour were examined in zebrafish model to find out any sign of 
neurotoxicity or behavioural changes due to Suvarna Bhasma administration.
RESULTS: Suvarna Bhasma has two types of gold particles, large ones (~60 μm) 
having irregular shapes, and nano-sized spherical particles (starting from 
~10 nm), the latter coated with Fe, Si, O, P and Na. XRD study revealed that all 
the peaks of Suvarna Bhasma match well with pure gold (face centred cube) with 
crystallites size 45 ± 2.8 nm. In rat studies, some change in biochemical 
parameters such as urea, creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 
observed mainly at the higher therapeutic dose; however, those parameters were 
within the normal range. There were no significant macroscopic as well as 
microscopic treatment-related alteration observed, in any of the organs and 
tissues evaluated. In zebrafish behavioural study, the motor parameters of 
Suvarna Bhasma treated fish showed normal behaviour analogous to the vehicle 
control group. Interestingly, the geotactic behaviour showed anxiolytic effects 
of Suvarna Bhasma as evidenced by the time spent in the upper zone, and average 
swimming height. The anxiolytic effects persisted for more than 30 days after 
withdrawing the Suvarna Bhasma treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Suvarna Bhasma contained spherical gold nanoparticles. It was 
nontoxic in rat model at the does tested. Suvarna Bhasma has anxiolytic effects 
in zebrafish behavioural model.

Fibroblast-derived exosomes have been reported to transfer microRNAs to 
recipient cells, where they regulate target gene expression, which is of 
interest for understanding the basic biology of inflammation, tissue 
homeostasis, and development of therapeutic approaches. Initial microarray-based 
analysis carried out in this study identified the rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA)-related differentially expressed gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 
(PDK4). Subsequently, the upstream regulatory microRNA-106b (miR-106b) of PDK4 
was predicted with bioinformatic analyses. A collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA)-induced mouse model was established, and exosomes were isolated from 
synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and transferred into chondrocytes to identify the 
role of exosomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We found that PDK4 was poorly 
expressed in RA cartilage tissues and chondrocytes, while miR-106b was highly 
expressed in RA SFs and SF-derived exosomes. Notably, PDK4 was confirmed as a 
target gene of miR-106b. Over-expression of PDK4 promoted the proliferation and 
migration abilities of chondrocytes and inhibited their apoptosis as well as 
affected the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand 
(RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system. Meanwhile, miR-106b was delivered 
from SFs to chondrocytes through exosomes, which suppressed chondrocyte 
proliferation and migration and accelerated apoptosis as well as affected the 
RANKL/RANK/OPG system via down-regulation of PDK4. Furthermore, in vivo results 
validated that miR-106b inhibition could relieve CIA-induced RA. Taken together, 
SF-derived exosomal miR-106b stimulates RA initiation by targeting PDK4, 
indicating a physiologically validated potential approach for the prevention and 
treatment of RA. KEY MESSAGES: PDK4 is decreased in chondrocytes of RA, while 
miR-106b is increased in SFBs. PDK4 promotes proliferation and migration of 
chondrocytes. miR-106b could target 3'UTR of PDK4 gene. SFB-exosomal miR-106b 
inhibits proliferation and migration of chondrocytes. Inhibition of miR-106b 
attenuates RA progression in a CIA mouse model.

Mast cells (MCs) were accumulated in synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) patients. MC activation releases numerous mediators including MC-chymase. 
Synovial fibroblast shows a dramatic hyperplasia in RA articular cavity, but the 
effects of MC-chymase on synovial fibroblast are unknown. In this study, the 
collagen-induced-arthritis (CIA) rat model was employed to evaluate the dynamic 
changes of MC-chymase activity and other inflammatory factors during CIA 
development in-vivo. The fresh primary synovial fibroblasts from normal or CIA 
rats were extracted to compare the differences of these two cell-types, and to 
investigate the effects of MC-chymase on both-types of synovial fibroblast. The 
data showed that the dynamic changes in chymase activity in synovial fluids of 
CIA rats before and after immunizations were companied with the changes of 
tryptase, MMP-2/-9, TNF-α, IL-6, Co-II IgG, total protein, paw-thickness and 
body weight in-vivo. The baseline differences in cell grow rates, expression 
levels of p21, FAK, MMP-9 between normal and CIA-SFB have been seen. Compared to 
the normal synovial fibroblasts, CIA-SFB increased the percentage of the cells 
transferred to S or G2/M phases in cell cycle in-vivo; CIA-SFB become more 
proliferative with high-expression MMP-2/9 during CIA development. MC-chymase 
in-vitro promoted both types of synovial fibroblast proliferation and induced 
cell cycle changes, but CIA-synovial fibroblasts exhibited much stronger 
responses to MC-chymase stimulation by increased expression levels of p21, FAK, 
MMP-9 which associated with cell adhesion and migration. This study might give a 
new insight that the activated mast cell can be an important target cell for RA 
treatment and suggest that MC-chymase needs well attention for therapeutic aims.

We examined whether the cathepsin K inhibitor, ONO-5334, administered alone or 
in combination with methotrexate (MTX), could ameliorate joint destruction 
evoked by collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in female cynomolgus monkeys. CIA was 
induced by immunizing with bovine type II collagen. ONO-5334 (30 mg/kg/day) was 
orally administered once daily and MTX (10 mg/body/day) twice weekly for 9 
weeks. X-ray (evaluation of joint destruction) and swelling (inflammatory) 
scores of proximal interphalangeal (PIP), distal interphalangeal (DIP), and 
metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints were evaluated. Urinary concentrations of 
C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and type II collagen (CTX-II) 
were measured. Arthritis, accompanied by bone and cartilage destruction, was 
successfully induced in this collagen-induced arthritis monkey model. ONO-5334 
showed no suppressive effect on joint swelling, while the joint swelling scores 
in the MTX and combination (ONO-5334 + MTX) groups were less than 50% compared 
with the control group. ONO-5334 decreased X-ray score by a mean of 64% (p<0.05 
vs the control group), and MTX also decreased in X-ray score by a mean of 46% 
but with no statistical significance. Combination of ONO-5334 and MTX further 
decreased the X-ray score by 28% over MTX group (74% reduction vs the control 
group, p<0.01). Maximum increase in CTX-I (10-fold) and CTX-II (7-fold) compared 
to baseline was observed at 7 and 3 weeks after the first sensitization, 
respectively. After treatment with ONO-5334 alone or in combination with MTX, 
concentrations were maintained near baseline for both markers. In conclusion, 
ONO-5334 prevented joint destruction but not joint inflammation in this monkey 
CIA model. Concomitant use of ONO-5334 with MTX reduced architectural joint 
destruction compared to MTX alone; therefore, ONO-5334 may help to prevent joint 
destruction in combination with MTX for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: Activation of osteoclastogenesis at the bone site in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) is well established. The mechanisms by which circulating 
osteoclast precursors contribute are still unclear. Peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) is implicated in 
transcriptional regulation of osteoclastogenesis in mouse models. This study was 
undertaken to investigate the contribution of PGC-1β to circulating osteoclast 
precursors and its link to bone destruction in RA.
METHODS: PGC-1β expression in RA peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes was increased 
and showed correlation with joint destruction shown on radiographs. Cells from 
RA patients or healthy controls were transfected with a lentivirus vector for 
PGC-1β gene silencing or overexpression and cultured with macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. Bone resorption activity, bone-degrading 
enzymes, and signaling molecules were measured in these mature osteoclasts.
RESULTS: Increased nuclear accumulation of PGC-1β was observed in RA peripheral 
blood CD14+ monocytes, and these cells had stronger osteoclastogenesis than in 
healthy controls. PGC-1β protein expression was positively correlated with 
radiographic joint destruction (r = 0.396-0.413; all P < 0.05). PGC-1β knockdown 
suppressed (51-82% reduction) the expression of cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase (TRAP), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), as well as 
osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity. Conversely, PGC-1β 
overexpression increased these markers (by 1.5-1.8-fold) and osteoclastogenesis. 
VIVIT, an inhibitor of NFATc1 activation, inhibited the effect of overexpressed 
PGC-1β by reducing cathepsin K, TRAP, and MMP-9 expression. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assay and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed PGC-1β 
bound to NFATc1 promoter, leading to transcriptional activation.
CONCLUSION: Activation of the PGC-1β/NFATc1 pathway in circulating osteoclast 
precursors was associated with bone destruction in RA. This may represent a new 
treatment target.

Increased osteoclastogenesis is a common feature of bone erosion, notably in 
osteoporosis but also in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and osteoarticular infections. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been 
described to impair monocyte differentiation into macrophages and dendritic 
cells. However, its effect on monocyte-derived osteoclasts is yet to be 
determined. We showed here that in vitro HCMV infection is associated with an 
inhibition of osteoclastogenesis through decreased expression of colony 
stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) and RANK in monocytes, which was mediated 
by an upregulation of quaking I-5 protein (QKI-5), a cellular RNA-interacting 
protein. We found that deliberate QKI5 overexpression in the absence of HCMV 
infection is able to decrease CSF-1R and RANK expression, leading to 
osteoclastogenesis inhibition. Finally, by using lentiviral vectors in a 
calvarial bone erosion mouse model, we showed that QKI5 inhibits bone 
degradation. This work identifies QKI5 as a strong inhibitor of bone resorption. 
Future research will point out whether QKI5 could be a target for bone 
pathologies. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

The present study was designed to explore the effects of B-cell activating 
factor receptor (BAFF-R) siRNA encapsulated nanoparticles on collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). BAFF-R siRNA encapsulated nanoparticles (NP-siBAFF-R) were 
constructed using a double emulsion method and was characterized by dynamic 
light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular uptake of 
nanoparticles was determined using flow cytometry. The CIA mouse model was 
established and the mice were intravenously injected with nanoparticles. 
NP-siBAFF-R effectively decreased the expression of BAFF-R in B cells and 
facilitated the delivery of siRNA into B cells. Treatment of NPsiBAFF-R 
ameliorated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms in the CIA mouse model via 
decreasing the arthritis score, mean ankle diameter, the levels of anti-collagen 
IgG in serum and increasing the expression of collagen type II and osteocalcin 
in dissected joint tissues. Additionally, treatment of NPsiBAFF-R decreased the 
percentage and number of B cells and inhibited the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA mice. These results demonstrate that 
NP-siBAFF-R may provide an effective strategy for RA treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Pirfenidone (PFD) is an oral anti-fibrotic drug used for idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) therapy. We determined the role of activating 
transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and the effect of PFD on fibroblast to 
myofibroblast transition (FMT) in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial 
lung disease (RA-ILD).
METHODS: RA-ILD lung specimens were obtained by CT-guided percutaneous 
transthoracic biopsy. A pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was established by the 
intratracheal injection of bleomycin. Pathological variation and the expression 
of α-SMA and ATF3 were observed by H&E, Masson and immunofluorescence staining. 
Primary human lung fibroblasts (pHLFs) were isolated from lung tissues that were 
pathologically confirmed to be normal by pneumonectomy. Cell viability was 
detected using an MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion were detected using a 
Transwell chamber. The protein levels of α-SMA, ATF3, Smad3 and p-Smad3 were 
measured by Western blot. HLFs were infected with lentiviruses expressing ATF3 
or scrambled shRNA.
RESULTS: ATF3 was dramatically upregulated in lung tissues from both 
bleomycin-induced mice and patients with RA-ILD compared with controls. The 
upregulation of ATF3 and the accumulation of collagen in the lung tissues of 
mice with pulmonary fibrosis were reduced by PFD. PFD significantly inhibited 
increases in the proliferation, invasion and migration of pHLFs stimulated by 
TGF-β1. Moreover, we observed the inhibitory effect of PFD on FMT via the 
downregulation of ATF3, which was further confirmed in ATF3 knockdown (KD) 
pHLFs.
CONCLUSIONS: This work shows the inhibitory effect of PFD on FMT in pHLFs, which 
is mediated by the downregulation of ATF3. Our findings suggest that PFD might 
have therapeutic potential for the treatment of RA-ILD.

Multitasking Kinase RIPK1 Regulates Cell Death and Inflammation.

Newton K(1).

California 94080, USA.

Receptor-interacting serine threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a widely expressed 
kinase that is essential for limiting inflammation in both mice and humans. Mice 
lacking RIPK1 die at birth from multiorgan inflammation and aberrant cell death, 
whereas humans lacking RIPK1 are immunodeficient and develop very early-onset 
inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast to complete loss of RIPK1, inhibiting 
the kinase activity of RIPK1 genetically or pharmacologically prevents cell 
death and inflammation in several mouse disease models. Indeed, small molecule 
inhibitors of RIPK1 are in phase I clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and phase II clinical trials for psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
ulcerative colitis. This review focuses on which signaling pathways use RIPK1, 
how activation of RIPK1 is regulated, and when activation of RIPK1 appears to be 
an important driver of inflammation.

Bee venom (BV) is widely used as a traditional China medicine to treat various 
conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of the present study 
was to evaluate the effects of systemic BV (60 mg/kg) as an anti-arthritic 
natural product, compare it with Methotrexate and determine the possible 
underlying mechanisms of BV action using complete Freund's adjuvant-induced 
arthritic rats. The development of signs of RA signs (knee joint circumference 
and arthritis scoring index) was evaluated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 
serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and serum interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels 
were measured at the end of the study. Histopathological examination followed by 
immunostaining of NF-κB (P65) was performed on the affected knee joints. 
Additionally, in vitro cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition activity, carrageenan paw 
edema test and acetic acid writhing tests were performed to evaluate the 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the assessed dose and compared with 
diclofenac. An acute toxicity test was performed to establish the safety of BV 
at high doses. The results of the present study highlighted the potential of 
systemic BV on preventing the development of signs of RA. BV also significantly 
reduced serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB in the affected joints. In 
addition to its potent analgesic activity, BV exhibited favorable inhibitory 
activity of the COX pathway in both in vivo and in vitro models. Therefore, high 
dose administration of systemic BV displayed safe and promising anti-arthritic, 
anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties through regulation of different 
mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of RA.

The resolution of inflammation is an active response involving the interaction 
of pro-resolving mediators with specific receptors, such as N-formyl peptide 
receptor 2 (FPR2). FPRs represent potentially important therapeutic targets for 
the treatment of some pathologies, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Previously, we identified selective or mixed FPR agonists with a 
pyridazin-3(2H)-one scaffold, all containing a 4-bromophenylacetamide fragment 
at N-2. The most effective compounds in this series were EC3, a potent mixed 
FPR1/FPR2/FPR3 agonist, and EC10, which had a preference for FPR1. We report 
here a new series of pyridinone and pyrimidindione derivatives containing the 
4-(bromophenyl)acetamide substituent that was essential for activity in the 
pyridazinone series. All new compounds were evaluated for FPR agonist activity 
in HL60 cells transfected with FPR1 or FPR2 and in human neutrophils. While most 
of the pyridinone derivatives had reasonable FPR agonist activity in the 
submicromolar/micromolar range, the pyrimidindione derivatives were less active. 
Compound 2a 
(N-(4-bromophenyl)-2-[3-cyano-5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl]acetamide) 
was the most active pyridinone derivative and had a 10-fold preference for FPR2 
(EC50 = 120 nM) versus FPR1 (EC50 = 1.6 μM). To assess their therapeutic 
activity, compounds 2a, EC3, and EC10 were evaluated in vivo using a rat model 
of rheumatoid arthritis. All three compounds increased the pain threshold and 
reduced pain hypersensitivity in the treated rats versus control rats, although 
2a and EC10 were much more effective than EC3. Thus, these FPR agonists 
represent potential leads to develop for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis and is a 
major cause of disability. Interestingly, the histone methyltransferase 
mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) has been linked to many inflammation-related 
diseases. Moreover, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been reported to induce 
migration and invasion in RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). This study 
intended to delineate the functional relevance of MLL1 in RA progression, which 
implicates the regulation of TLR4. First, clinical synovial tissues were 
collected from RA patients and patients with severe joint trauma to isolate 
FLSs. We identified highly expressed MLL1 and TLR4 in synovial tissues of RA 
patients, and the expression of them was positively correlated in RA-FLSs. More 
importantly, silencing of MLL1 and TLR4 resulted in suppressed migration and 
invasion of RA-FLSs, accompanied by reduced inflammation. Additionally, 
mechanistic investigations showed that MLL1 upregulated TLR4 expression by 
inducing H3K4me3 in the promoter region of TLR4. Functional assays revealed that 
overexpression of MLL1 activated the TRIF/NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in 
accelerated migration and invasion, and inflammation of RA-FLSs in vitro. TLR4 
knockdown could compromise the effects of MLL1 overexpression. The in vivo 
assays in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model validated the in vitro 
findings. Taken together, histone methyltransferase MLL1 induces TLR4 expression 
by mediating H3K4me3 in the TLR4 promoter, thus activating the TRIF/NF-κB 
signaling pathway, which thereby promotes the migration and invasion of RA-FLSs 
and ultimately exacerbates the progression of RA.

The traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H.T. Chang 
has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum 
after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant 
component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular 
target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in 
different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of 
notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, 
notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit 
JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, 
leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 
Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF 
blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by 
targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be 
effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway.

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by a chronic inflammatory response 
resulting in destruction of the joint and significant pain. Although a range of 
treatments are available to control disease activity in RA, bone destruction and 
joint pain exist despite suppression of inflammation. This study is aimed at 
assessing the effects of parthenolide (PAR) on paw inflammation, bone 
destruction, and pain-like behaviour in a mild collagen antibody-induced 
arthritis (CAIA) mouse model. CAIA was induced in BALB/c mice and treated daily 
with 1 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg PAR. Clinical paw inflammation was scored daily, and 
mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed on alternate days. At end point, bone 
volume and swelling in the paws were assessed using micro-CT. Paw tissue 
sections were assessed for inflammation and pre-/osteoclast-like cells. The 
lumbar spinal cord and the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and rostral ventromedulla 
(RVM) regions of the brain were stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) and ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) to assess for glial 
reactivity. Paw scores increased in CAIA mice from days 5-10 and were reduced 
with 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg PAR on days 8-10. Osteoclast-like cells on the bone 
surface of the radiocarpal joint and within the soft tissue of the hind paw were 
significantly lower following PAR treatment (p < 0.005). GFAP- and IBA1-positive 
cells in the PAG and RVM were significantly lower following treatment with 
1 mg/kg (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively) and 4 mg/kg PAR (p < 0.0001 
and p = 0.001, respectively). In the lumbar spinal cord, IBA1-positive cells 
were significantly lower in CAIA mice treated with 4 mg/kg PAR (p = 0.001). The 
findings indicate a suppressive effect of both low- and moderate-dose PAR on paw 
inflammation, osteoclast presence, and glial cell reactivity in a mild CAIA 
mouse model.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of Lactobacillus sakei in a 
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in human immune cells.
METHODS: We evaluated whether L. sakei reduced the severity of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) and modulated interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-10 levels, as well as 
whether it affected the differentiation of CD4+ T cells and regulatory B cells. 
We evaluated osteoclastogenesis after culturing bone marrow-derived mononuclear 
cells with L. sakei.
RESULTS: The differentiation of T helper 17 cells and the serum level of IL-17 
were suppressed by L. sakei in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
mouse splenocytes. The serum level of IL-10 was significantly increased in the 
L. sakei-treated group, whereas the regulatory T cell population was unchanged. 
The population of regulatory B cells significantly increased the in L. 
sakei-treated group. Oral administration of L. sakei reduced the arthritis 
incidence and score in mice with CIA. Finally, osteoclastogenesis and the mRNA 
levels of osteoclast-related genes were suppressed in the L. sakei-treated 
group.
CONCLUSION: L. sakei exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in an animal model of 
RA, regulated Th17 and regulatory B cell differentiation, and suppressed 
osteoclastogenesis. Our findings suggest that L. sakei has therapeutic potential 
for RA.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), an established pro-inflammatory cytokine 
plays a central role in the induction and progression of several chronic 
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Targeting TNF-α as a treatment modality 
has shown tremendous success, however there are several limitations associated 
with the current anti-TNF-α biologic drugs including: immunogenicity, 
life-threatening infections, resistance to treatment, complexity of manufacture 
and cost of treatment. Here, we report the in vivo efficacy of novel anti-TNF-α 
formats generated from molecular engineering of variable new antigen receptors 
(VNARs), originally derived from the immune system of an immunized nurse shark. 
Two anti-TNF-α VNAR formats, a tandem multivalent trimer, D1-BA11-C4 and an 
Fc-fused quadrivalent D1-Fc-C4 (Quad-X™) construct were tested in a clinically 
relevant, preclinical mouse efficacy model of polyarthritis (Tg197) and compared 
to the commercial anti-TNF-α "best in class" therapy, Adalimumab (Humira®). Both 
VNAR formats bind and neutralize TNF-α through an epitope that appears to be 
different from those recognized by other anti-TNF biologics used clinically. All 
doses of Quad-X™, from 0.5 to 30 mg/kg, significantly blocked the development of 
polyarthritis. At 0.5 mg/kg Quad-X™, the arthritis score was improved by 76% and 
the histopathology score by 63%. At 3 mg/kg Quad-X™, control of disease was 
almost complete at 90% (arthritis) and 88% (histopathology). In marked contrast, 
1 mg/kg Humira® saw profound disease breakthrough with scores of 39 and 16% 
respectively, increasing to a respectable 82 and 86% inhibition at 10 mg/kg 
Humira®. We have previously reported the superior potency of anti-TNF-α VNARs in 
vitro and in these studies translate this superiority into an in vivo setting 
and demonstrate the potential of VNAR formats to meet the requirements of 
next-generation anti-TNF-α therapies.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease in 
which activated RA fibroblast-1ike synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are one of the main 
factors responsible for inducing morbidity. Previous reports have shown that 
RA-FLSs have proliferative features similar to cancer cells, in addition to 
causing cartilage erosion that eventually causes joint damage. Thus, new 
therapeutic strategies and drugs that can effectively contain the abnormal 
hyperplasia of RA-FLSs and restrain RA development are necessary for the 
treatment of RA. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), one of the main phytochemicals 
isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is capable of promoting RA-FLS 
apoptosis and inhibiting arthritis in an AIA mouse model. In addition, RA 
patients treated at our clinic with Tan IIA showed significant improvements in 
their clinical symptoms. However, the details of the molecular mechanism by 
which Tan IIA effects RA are unknown. To clarify this mechanism, we evaluated 
the antiproliferative and inhibitory effects of proinflammatory factor 
production caused by Tan IIA to RA-FLSs. We demonstrated that Tan IIA can 
restrict the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RA-FLSs in a time- and 
dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Tan IIA effectively suppressed the increase in 
mRNA expression of some matrix metalloproteinases and proinflammatory factors 
induced by TNF-α in RA-FLSs, resulting in inflammatory reactivity inhibition and 
blocking the destruction of the knee joint. Through the integration of network 
pharmacology analyses with the experimental data obtained, it is revealed that 
the effects of Tan IIA on RA can be attributed to its influence on different 
signaling pathways, including MAPK, AKT/mTOR, HIF-1, and NF-kB. Taken together, 
these data suggest that the compound Tan IIA has great therapeutic potential for 
RA treatment.

Recent studies indicate that glucose metabolism is altered in rheumatoid 
arthritis. We hypothesize that Pkm2, as a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis 
pathway, triggers the activation of macrophages (Mφ), which results in 
proinflammatory cytokine production during the arthritis progress. In this 
study, Pkm2 was found to be overexpressed in ED1-positive Mφ in spleens and 
synovial tissues from arthritic rats via immunofluorescence, Western blotting, 
and quantitative RT-PCR. To reveal the role of Pkm2, Dark Agouti rats were 
treated with either Pkm2 enzyme inhibitor shikonin or the RNA interference 
plasmids of Pkm2 and negative control plasmids, respectively, via i.p. 
injection. Pkm2 intervention could alleviate the severity of pristane-induced 
arthritis in aspects of the macroscopic arthritis score, perimeter changes of 
midpaw, and the synovitis and destruction of the bone and cartilage as well as 
reduce the ED1 and p-Stat1-positive cell population in rat synovial tissues. 
Silencing Pkm2 by RNA interference in classical activated rat and mouse Mφ 
resulted in less Tnf-α, Il-1β production via Stat1 signaling. Collectively, Pkm2 
is highly expressed in ED1-positive Mφ of spleens and synovial tissues from 
arthritic rats and promotes Mφ activation via Stat1 signaling. Pkm2 might be a 
promising selective metabolic target molecule for rheumatoid arthritis 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have confirmed that aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is 
up-regulated in synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its exact pathogenic 
mechanisms in RA are unclear. This study revealed the pathogenic role of AQP1 in 
rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and the underlying mechanisms related to 
β-catenin signaling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary paw swelling and pathological changes of ankle 
joints were used to evaluate the severity of rat CIA. Synovial AQP1 and 
β-catenin expression were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western 
blot assay. AQP1 siRNA was applied to knockdown AQP1 in cultured CIA 
fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS). Assays of MTT, PCNA immunofluorescence and 
transwell were performed to detect cell proliferation, migration and invasion. 
The protein levels of β-catenin pathway members and ratio of TOP/FOP luciferase 
activity were also measured.
RESULTS: In vivo, we revealed that synovial AQP1 and β-catenin expressions in 
CIA rats were higher than normal rats, and synovial AQP1 expression of CIA rats 
increased in parallel with secondary paw swelling and total pathological score 
on joint damage. Correlation analysis of IHC results indicated that synovial 
AQP1 expression positively correlated with β-catenin expression in CIA rat. In 
vitro, AQP1 siRNA apparently reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion 
of CIA FLS by inhibiting β-catenin signaling pathway. As an activator of 
β-catenin signaling, lithium chloride (an inhibitor of GSK-3β) reversed the 
inhibitory effects of AQP1 siRNA on the cultured CIA FLS.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that the overexpression of synovial AQP1 aggravated rat 
CIA by promoting the activation of FLS through β-catenin signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: The Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) is 
known to exert negative regulatory effects on immune cell signaling. Mice with 
mutations in the Shp1 gene develop inflammatory skin disease and autoimmunity, 
but no arthritis. We sought to explore the role of SHP-1 in arthritis using an 
autoimmune mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. We generated Shp1 transgenic 
(Shp1-Tg) mice to study the impact of SHP-1 overexpression on arthritis 
susceptibility and adaptive immune responses.
METHODS: SHP-1 gene and protein expression as well as tyrosine phosphatase 
activity were evaluated in spleen cells of transgenic and wild type (WT) mice. 
WT and Shp1-Tg (homozygous or heterozygous for the transgene) mice were 
immunized with human cartilage proteoglycan (PG) in adjuvant, and arthritis 
symptoms were monitored. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation level, net cytokine 
secretion, and serum anti-human PG antibody titers were measured in immune cells 
from WT and Shp1-Tg mice. WT mice were treated with regorafenib orally to 
activate SHP-1 either before PG-induced arthritis (PGIA) symptoms developed 
(preventive treatment) or starting at an early stage of disease (therapeutic 
treatment). Data were statistically analyzed and graphs created using GraphPad 
Prism 8.0.2 software.
RESULTS: SHP-1 expression and tyrosine phosphatase activity were elevated in 
both transgenic lines compared to WT mice. While all WT mice developed arthritis 
after immunization, none of the homozygous Shp1-Tg mice developed the disease. 
Heterozygous transgenic mice, which showed intermediate PGIA incidence, were 
selected for further investigation. We observed differences in interleukin-4 and 
interleukin-10 production in vitro, but serum anti-PG antibody levels were not 
different between the genotypes. We also found decreased tyrosine 
phosphorylation of several proteins of the JAK/STAT pathway in T cells from 
PG-immunized Shp1-Tg mice. Regorafenib administration to WT mice prevented the 
development of severe PGIA or reduced disease severity when started after 
disease onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to arthritis in the presence of SHP-1 overexpression 
likely results from the impairment of tyrosine phosphorylation (deactivation) of 
key immune cell signaling proteins in the JAK/STAT pathway, due to the 
overwhelming tyrosine phosphatase activity of the enzyme in Shp1-Tg mice. Our 
study is the first to investigate the role of SHP-1 in autoimmune arthritis 
using animals overexpressing this phosphatase. Pharmacological activation of 
SHP-1 might be considered as a new approach to the treatment of autoimmune 
arthritis.

A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated the determination and 
pharmacokinetic study of magnoflorine, cauloside C, hederagenin, and oleanolic 
acid from Caulophyllum robustum. Digoxin was used as the internal standard. The 
pretreated plasma samples were carried out on a Waters ACQUITYUPLC HSS T3 column 
at 35 °C with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate 
of 0.2 mL/min. This article describes the most simple, sensitive, and validated 
UPLC-MS/MS method to date for the simultaneous successful determination of four 
compounds in rat plasma after oral administration of the extract of C. robustum 
and their pharmacokinetic studies.

Previous studies have found that increased expression of Nav1.9 and protein 
kinase C (PKC) contributes to pain hypersensitivity in a couple of inflammatory 
pain models. Here we want to observe if PKC can regulate the expression of 
Nav1.9 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain model. A 
chronic knee joint inflammation model was produced by intra-articular injection 
of the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. Nociceptive behaviors including 
mechanical, cold, and heat hyperalgesia were examined. The expression of Nav1.9 
and PKCα in DRG was detected by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction, 
Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The in vitro and in vivo effects of a PKC 
activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]) and a PKC inhibitor 
(GF-109203X) on the expression of Nav1.9 were examined. Moreover, the effects of 
PKC modulators on nociceptive behaviors were studied. Increased mechanical, 
heat, and cold sensitivity was observed 3 to 14 days after CFA injection. 
Parallel increases in messenger RNA and protein expression of Nav1.9 and PKCα 
were found. Immunofluorescence experiments found that Nav1.9 was preferentially 
colocalized with IB4+DRG neurons in RA rats. In cultured DRG neurons, PMA 
increased Nav1.9 expression while GF-109203X prevented the effect of PMA. PMA 
increased Nav1.9 expression in naïve rats while GF-109203X decreased Nav1.9 
expression in RA rats. In naïve rats, PMA caused mechanical and cold 
hyperalgesia. On the other hand, GF-109203X attenuated mechanical and cold 
hyperalgesia in RA-pain model. Nav1.9 might be upregulated by PKCα in DRG, which 
contributes to pain hypersensitivity in CFA-induced chronic knee joint 
inflammation model of RA pain.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is more common and severe in women compared to men. 
Both women and men with RA express autoantibodies to post-translationally 
modified antigens, including citrullinated and homocitrullinated proteins or 
peptides. These autoantibodies are strongly linked with the HLA-DR4 gene. The 
objective of this study was to determine sex differences in immune responses to 
homocitrullinated antigens. We used a humanized animal model of RA, 
DR4-transgenic mice and immunized them with a homocitrullinated peptide called 
HomoCitJED. Immune responses in these mice were measured for splenocyte 
proliferation by tritiated thymidine incorporation, serum autoantibody 
production by ELISA and cytokine levels by multiplex. We found that T cell and 
antibody responses to homocitrullinated antigens were similar in male and female 
mice. However, we found sex differences in serum cytokine profiles with female 
mice having higher ratio of IL-1α to IL-5, suggesting imbalances in immune 
regulation. This is the first study to report that immune responses to 
homocitrullinated antigens can be differentiated by sex.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease of idiopathic etiology 
that triggers inflammatory cytokines compromising the joint mobility. 
Epidemiological evidences recommend the utilization of galantamine (GH) to 
reverse the anti-inflammatory reactions induced RA. Oral administration of GH is 
non-selectivity due to its association with serious gastrointestinal symptoms 
which, could hinder its therapeutic success. Therefore, the present study aimed 
to validate the therapeutic potential of GH transdermal patches as a novel 
application to constitute an effective and tolerable delivery system for 
managing RA in adjuvant arthritis model. RA was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats 
intradermally by Heat-killed M (0.12 ml/day). Oral GH (1.25 mg/kg/day) and GH 
transdermal patch (2.5 mg/kg/2 days) were administrated for 14 days, during 
which the hind paw and body weight (BW) were assessed. Effects of C-reactive 
protein (CRP), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-1β) and Janus kinase 
(JAK-2) were evaluated. Oral- and transdermal GH significantly improved the hind 
paw edema in arthritis animal model and offered a protective impact against RA. 
Oral GH group showed marked decrease in BW than that of transdermal patches 
group. Transdermal patch group showed a significant decrease in the level of 
IL-1β more than the oral group. However, no significant difference was detected 
in the levels of TNF-α and IL-10 between the two groups. It is concluded that GH 
transdermal patch can be a promising drug delivery system that copes with side 
effects better than oral GH consequently represents novel strategy in management 
of RA.

The purpose of the experiment was to study the effects of betulinic acid (BA) on 
adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. The rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (AA) 
was established by Freund's complete adjuvant. Arthritis index, joint pathology, 
toe swelling, hemorheology, related cytokines and ROCK/NF-κB signaling pathway 
were measured in rats. BA can significantly inhibit the arthritis index, improve 
joint pathology, reduce toe swelling, improve blood rheology, improve synovial 
cell apoptosis, and restore related cytokine negative regulation of ROCK/NF-κB 
signaling pathways. BA has an obvious therapeutic effect on joint inflammation 
of toes in AA model rats, which may be due to the regulation of ROCK/NF-κB 
signaling pathway.

PURPOSES: Lymphocyte proliferation is a major factor determining the magnitude 
of the immune response. Both dexamethasone (DEX) and tofacitinib (TOF) exert 
marked immunosuppressive effects and are mainstay drugs in the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study was aimed to explore the single and 
combined anti-proliferative action of DEX and TOF on lymphocytes and their sex 
differences.
METHODS: The single-drug effects and dual-drug interactions of TOF and DEX were 
assessed on the in vitro concanavalin A-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes 
isolated from male and female rat and human peripheral blood.
RESULTS: DEX was more potent than TOF across species and sex. DEX showed greater 
inhibition on rat lymphocytes compared to those from humans, which was reflected 
in both Imax and IC50. The antiproliferative action of TOF was comparable in 
rats and humans with exception of a higher IC50 in male rats. Both sex- and 
species-related differences were detected in DEX/TOF interactions with 
synergistic effects in male lymphocytes, and additive and antagonistic effect 
for females in humans and rats.
CONCLUSION: TOF has a promising steroid-sparing potential with the beneficial 
effects of the combination therapy more likely in males than females.

The participation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRs) in the 
progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a key area of investigation. The 
current study aimed to investigate the action of lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle 
assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) in fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) proliferation 
and synovitis in RA. A rat model of RA was established. LncRNA NEAT1 expression 
in the synovial tissues of patients with RA and FLSs from the RA rat model was 
determined using RT-qPCR. Next, dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied 
to investigate the relationship between miR-129/204 and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK). A putative 
binding relationship between miR-204 and lncRNA NEAT1 was evaluated by RIP 
assay, and miR-129 promoter methylation was determined using MSP. After the 
expression of lncRNA NEAT1, miR-129 or miR-204 were altered in FLSs, the extent 
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assessed. In addition, FLS synovitis and 
proliferation were determined by ELISA and EdU assay, respectively. In RA rats, 
lncRNA NEAT1 was silenced and miR-129/miR-204 was overexpressed to explore their 
roles in vivo. LncRNA NEAT1 was upregulated, while miR-129 and miR-204 were 
downregulated in RA synovial tissues and FLSs. MAPK1 was target gene of both 
miR-129 and miR-204. LncRNA NEAT1 bound to miR-204 and promoted miR-129 promoter 
methylation. Silencing lncRNA NEAT1 or overexpressing miR-129/miR-204 enhanced 
miR-129/miR-204 expression, but reduced the extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 
proliferation of FLSs, and synovitis in RA. Collectively, silencing lncRNA NEAT1 
promoted miR-129 and miR-204 to inhibit the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, reducing 
FLS synovitis in RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic joint inflammation, which 
forms pannus with bone destruction. Bony ankylosis is also observed following 
inflammation; however, the mechanism behind this aberrant bone formation in RA 
had remained unclear. Based on our recent findings obtained using a novel 
arthritis model called D1BC mouse, we found that synovial fibroblasts in pannus 
consist of at least three different populations with the osteochondrogenic 
lineage being predominant. We also found endochondral ossification like that in 
embryonic bone development adjacent to invasive synovial fibroblasts. Such 
ectopic endochondral ossification leads to the failure of bone repair and 
results in ankylosis. In this review, we describe the character of synovial 
fibroblasts toward the osteochondrogenic lineage and ectopic endochondral 
ossification in an inflammatory arthritis mouse model.

Dysfunction of the immune regulatory system plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) 
has multiple bioactivities. This study aims to investigate the role of VIP in 
the maintenance of the immune regulatory capacity of monocytes (Mos). Human 
peripheral blood samples were collected from RA patients and healthy control 
(HC) subjects. Mos and CD14+ CD71- CD73+ CD25+ regulatory Mos (RegMos) were 
isolated from the blood samples and characterized by flow cytometry. A rat RA 
model was developed to test the role of VIP in the maintenance of the immune 
regulatory function of Mos. The results showed that RegMos of HC subjects had 
immune suppressive functions. RegMos of RA patients expressed less interleukin 
(IL)-10 and showed an incompetent immune regulatory capacity. Serum levels of 
VIP were lower in RA patients, which were positively correlated with the 
expression of IL-10 in RegMos. In-vitro experiments showed that the IL-10 mRNA 
decayed spontaneously in RegMos, which could be prevented by the presence of VIP 
in the culture. VIP suppressed the effects of tristetraprolin (TTP) on inducing 
IL-10 mRNA decay in RegMos. Administration of VIP inhibited experimental RA in 
rats through restoring the IL-10 expression in RegMos. RegMos have immune 
suppressive functions. VIP is required in maintaining IL-10 expression in 
RegMos. The data suggest that VIP has translational potential in the treatment 
of immune disorders such as RA.

Neutrophils are a major member of the innate immune system and play pivotal 
roles in host defense against pathogens and pathologic inflammatory reactions. 
Neutrophils can be recruited to inflammation sites via the guidance of cytokines 
and chemokines. Overwhelming infiltration of neutrophils can lead to 
indiscriminate tissue damage, such as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Neutrophils 
isolated from peritoneal exudate respond to a defined chemoattractant, 
N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), in vitro in Transwell or Zigmond chamber assays. 
The air pouch experiment can be used to evaluate the chemotaxis of neutrophils 
towards lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo. The adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) 
mouse model is frequently used in RA research, and immunohistochemical staining 
of joint sections with anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) or anti-neutrophil elastase 
(NE) antibodies is a well-established method to measure neutrophil infiltration. 
These methods can be used to discover promising therapies targeting neutrophil 
migration.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have anti-inflammatory and regenerative 
properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of locally 
administered ADSCs in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mouse model. In an in vivo 
experiment, single-cell ADSCs and three dimensionally-cultured ADSC spheroids 
were injected intra-articularly into the knees of RA model mice and 
histologically assessed. Marked improvement of synovial inflammation and 
articular cartilage regeneration was found in ADSC-treated mice. Proliferation, 
migration, and apoptosis assays of synovial fibroblasts incubated with 
single-cell and spheroid ADSCs were performed. The expression levels of total 
cytokine RNA in ADSC single cells, spheroids, and ADSC-treated inflammatory 
synovial fibroblasts were also evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR. ADSCs suppressed the proliferation and migration of activated inflammatory 
cells and downregulated inflammatory cytokines. TSG-6 and TGFβ1 were 
significantly upregulated in ADSCs compared to controls and TGFβ1 was 
significantly upregulated in ADSC spheroids compared to single cells. The 
apoptosis rate of ADSC spheroids was significantly lower than that of 
single-cell ADSCs. These results indicated that intra-articular administration 
of ADSC single cells and spheroids was effective in an RA mouse model, offering 
a novel approach for the development of effective localized treatments for 
patients with RA.

OBJECTIVES: While myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were previously shown 
to promote a proinflammatory T helper (Th) 17 response in autoimmune conditions, 
a potential impact of the MDSC-Th17 immune axis on abnormal bone destruction in 
RA remains largely unknown.
METHODS: We investigated the correlation between the frequency of MDSCs or its 
subsets and joint destruction in RA patients. The reciprocal actions of 
patient-derived MDSCs and Th17 cells were studied using osteoclast (OC) 
differentiation and bone resorption assays in vitro, which were further 
validated using mouse models of RA. Contribution of MDSCs to osteoclastogenesis 
and bone erosion in vivo was determined by depletion or transfer of MDSCs.
RESULTS: Human MDSCs, particularly monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), exhibit inherent 
OC-differentiating capacity and positively correlate with clinical bone erosion 
in RA patients. Strikingly, patient-derived M-MDSCs can program Th17 cells 
towards a pro-osteoclastogenic phenotype, which in return potentiates OC 
differentiation via the receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand 
(RANK-L)-RANK signalling. This enhanced osteolysis driven by the reciprocal 
actions of M-MDSCs and Th17 cells is further confirmed using mouse models of RA. 
Selective depletion of M-MDSCs significantly ameliorates osteoclastogenesis and 
disease severity in arthritic mice, whereas transfer of M-MDSCs aggravates bone 
erosion associated with increased OCs in recipient mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the functional plasticity of MDSCs and 
identify a novel pro-osteoclastogenic pathway governed by interplay between 
myeloid cells and T lymphocytes in autoimmune RA.

Although the E3 ubiquitin ligase Zinc and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3) negatively 
regulates the Wnt signaling pathway, its function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
is elusive. Here, the effects and the mechanism of ZNRF3 on a mouse model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) 
obtained from RA patients were determined. Our results showed that ZNRF3 was 
highly expressed in tissues and FLSs compared to trauma patients. 
Lentivirus-mediated silencing of ZNRF3 induced apoptosis decreased cell 
viability and significantly attenuated inflammation in RA-FLSs via tumor 
necrosis-α (TNF-α). Additionally, silencing of ZNRF3 reduced knee joint damage 
and also decreased the level of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the CIA mouse model. 
These effects were mediated by the crosstalk between Wnt and NF-κB pathways in 
RA-FLS.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of knee joints involving pain 
and inflammation. Rhoifolin is a plant flavonoid known to have antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties. This study was taken to identify the effect of 
rhoifolin on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in the rat 
model. Treatment with rhoifolin (10 and 20 mg/kg) showed a significant 
improvement in the overall health parameters such as paw edema and weight loss. 
This improvement in morphological parameters corroborated the findings with 
gross morphological changes observed in the histopathological analysis. 
Rhoifolin treatment also caused a significant decrease in oxidative stress, 
evident from changes in intracellular levels of glutathione, glutathione 
peroxidase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase in the articular cartilage 
tissue. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
interleukin(IL)-1β, and IL-6 showed a significant downregulation of gene 
expression and intracellular protein concentration levels. The NF-κB pathway 
showed a significant attenuation as evident in the significant reduction in the 
levels of NF-κB p65 and p-IκB-α. These results indicated that rhoifolin can be a 
natural therapeutic alternative to the extant regimens, which include 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressants. Additionally, the 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of rhoifolin was probably mediated by 
the NF-κB pathway. However, the exact target molecules of this pathway need to 
be determined in further studies.

Paeoniflorin-6'-O-benzene sulfonate (CP-25) is a novel compound derived from 
paeoniflorin that has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects in a rat 
model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the underlying mechanism has not 
been elucidated to date. We explored this mechanism in the present study by 
treating rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA) with CP-25. We found that the 
membrane EP4 protein level was downregulated; whereas, GRK2 was upregulated, in 
fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS)s of AA rats. Prostaglandin (PGE)2 stimulated 
FLS proliferation and enhanced the membrane EP4 receptor protein level; the 
latter was reversed by the administration of an EP4 receptor agonist, whereas 
the membrane GRK2 protein level gradually increased. The changes in the EP4 
receptor and GRK2 expression were enhanced by TNF-α, and the former was 
accompanied by an alteration in the cyclic (c)AMP level. The EP4 receptor 
agonist stimulation increased the association between GRK2 and the EP4 receptor. 
GRK2 knockdown abrogated the abnormalities in FLS proliferation. The CP-25 
treatment (100 mg/kg) suppressed joint inflammation with an efficacy that was 
similar to that of methotrexate. This finding was associated with EP4 
upregulation and GRK2 downregulation in FLSs. Thus, GRK2 plays an important role 
in the abnormal FLS proliferation observed in AA possibly by promoting EP4 
receptor desensitization and decreasing the cAMP level. Our results demonstrate 
that CP-25 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of human RA via GRK2 
regulation.

SIGNIFICANCE: Current guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management 
recommend early treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
However, DMARD treatment fails in 30% of patients and current monitoring methods 
can only detect failure after 3 to 6 months of therapy.
AIM: We investigated whether joint blood flow (BF), quantified using dynamic 
contrast-enhanced time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy, can monitor disease 
activity and treatment response in a rat model of RA.
APPROACH: Ankle joint BF was measured every 5 days in eight rats with 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) and four healthy controls. Arthritis was 
allowed to progress for 20 days before rats with AIA were treated with a DMARD 
once every 5 days until day 40.
RESULTS: Time and group had separate significant main effects on joint BF; 
however, there was no significant interaction between time and group despite a 
notable difference in average joint BF on day 5. Comparison of individual blood 
flow measures between rats with AIA and control group animals did not reveal a 
clear response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Joint BF time courses could not distinguish between rats with AIA 
and study controls. Heterogeneous disease response and low temporal frequency of 
BF measurements may have been important study limitations.

BACKGROUND: Antibodies binding to cartilage proteins are present in the blood 
and synovial fluid of early rheumatoid arthritis patients. In order to develop 
animal models mimicking the human disease, we have characterized the 
arthritogenic capacity of monoclonal antibodies directed towards different joint 
proteins in the cartilage.
METHODS: Purified antibodies specific to unmodified or citrullinated collagen 
type II (CII), collagen type XI (CXI), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
(COMP) were produced as culture supernatant, affinity purified, pooled as 
antibody cocktails (Cab3 and Cab4), and injected intravenously into mice to 
induce arthritis. An adjuvant (lipopolysaccharide or mannan) was subsequently 
injected intraperitoneally on either day 5 or day 60 to enhance arthritis. 
Antibody binding and complement activation on the cartilage surface were 
analyzed by immunohistochemical methods. Bone erosions and joint deformations 
were analyzed by histological assessments, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, 
and micro-CT. Luminex was used to detect CII-triple helical epitope-specific 
antibody responses.
RESULTS: The new cartilage antibody cocktails induced an earlier and more severe 
disease than anti-CII antibody cocktail. Many of the mouse strains used 
developed severe arthritis with 3 antibodies, binding to collagen II, collagen 
XI, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (the Cab3 cocktail). Two new models 
of arthritis including Cab3-induced LPS-enhanced arthritis (lpsCAIA) and 
Cab3-induced mannan-enhanced arthritis (mCAIA) were established, causing severe 
bone erosions and bone loss, as well as epitope spreading of the B cell 
response. Cab4, with addition of an antibody to citrullinated collagen II, 
induced arthritis more efficiently in moderately susceptible C57BL/6 J mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The new mouse model for RA induced with cartilage antibodies allows 
studies of chronic development of arthritis and epitope spreading of the 
autoimmune response and bone erosion.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis has been associated with dysregulation of 
long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression in serum and in 
lesioned tissue. In this study, a microarray assay was performed to study the 
profile of lncRNAs in the serum of RA patients and healthy donors, and a set of 
novel lncRNAs associated with RA was identified. For the remainder of the study, 
focus is on the top hit, lncRNA uc.477. The upregulation of lncRNA uc.477 and 
downregulation of miR-19b were validated in the serum of RA patients compared to 
that of healthy donors, and similar results were further confirmed by 
quantitative real-time PCR analysis of a cell line: RA-derived human 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS-RA). LncRNA uc.477 could interfere with the 
processing of pri-miR-19b to produce its mature form and thereby played a 
pro-inflammatory role. In addition, Huayu Qiangshen Tongbi formula (HQT), a 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been shown to exert a promising 
therapeutic effect on RA and to exhibit long-term safety in our previous 
clinical retrospective study. Importantly, HQT treatment normalized the 
levels of lncRNA uc.477 and miR-19b in HFLS-RA in vitro and in mouse models of 
collagen-induced arthritis. HQT treatment, knockdown of lncRNA uc.477, and 
overexpression of miR-19b resulted in a comparable inhibition of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in HFLS-RA cells. Together, these data 
suggest that the therapeutic effects of HQT on RA are closely related to its 
modulation of lncRNA uc.477 and miR-19b.

BACKGROUND: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the cause for loss of tolerance and 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) production remains unidentified. 
Mouse studies showed that lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) maintain peripheral 
tolerance through presentation of peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs). We 
hypothesize that dysregulation of peripheral tolerance mechanisms in human LNSCs 
might underlie pathogenesis of RA.
METHOD: Lymph node (LN) needle biopsies were obtained from 24 RA patients, 23 
individuals positive for RA-associated autoantibodies but without clinical 
disease (RA-risk individuals), and 14 seronegative healthy individuals. Ex vivo 
human LNs from non-RA individuals were used to directly analyze stromal cells. 
Molecules involved in antigen presentation and immune modulation were measured 
in LNSCs upon interferon γ (IFNγ) stimulation (n = 15).
RESULTS: Citrullinated targets of ACPAs were detected in human LN tissue and in 
cultured LNSCs. Human LNSCs express several PTAs, transcription factors 
autoimmune regulator (AIRE) and deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 
(DEAF1), and molecules involved in citrullination, antigen presentation, and 
immunomodulation. Overall, no clear differences between donor groups were 
observed with exception of a slightly lower induction of human leukocyte 
antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) molecules in 
LNSCs from RA patients.
CONCLUSION: Human LNSCs have the machinery to regulate peripheral tolerance 
making them an attractive target to exploit in tolerance induction and 
maintenance.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the world 
population and is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints sometimes 
accompanied by extra-articular manifestations. K/BxN mice, originally described 
in 1996 as a model of polyarthritis, exhibit knee joint alterations. The aim of 
this study was to describe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) inflammation and damage 
in these mice. We used relevant imaging modalities, such as micro-magnetic 
resonance imaging (μMRI) and micro-computed tomography (μCT), as well as 
histology and immunofluorescence techniques to detect TMJ alterations in this 
mouse model. Histology and immunofluorescence for Col-I, Col-II, and aggrecan 
showed cartilage damage in the TMJ of K/BxN animals, which was also evidenced by 
μCT but was less pronounced than that seen in the knee joints. μMRI observations 
suggested an increased volume of the upper articular cavity, an indicator of an 
inflammatory process. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) isolated from the TMJ 
of K/BxN mice secreted inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β) and expressed 
degradative mediators such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). K/BxN mice 
represent an attractive model for describing and investigating spontaneous 
damage to the TMJ, a painful disorder in humans with an etiology that is still 
poorly understood.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that primarily 
affects joints. Clinical studies and animal models evidenced that mononuclear 
phagocytes including monocytes and macrophages are crucial to RA pathogenesis, 
contributing to inflammation and destruction of cartilage and bone. The last 
decade of research has tremendously changed our view on the origin of 
tissue-resident macrophages. In light of the recent publications that reveal 
important phenotypic and functional heterogeneity among macrophages, it is of 
paramount importance to identify the synovial macrophage subsets that might 
amplify the inflammatory response or promote the restoration of tissue 
homeostasis. In this review, we highlight latest studies applying single-cell 
RNA sequencing that provide deeper insights in macrophage subsets and their 
putative functions within both human and mouse synovial joint tissue.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often accompanied by joint pain and 
inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated that functional Fcγ receptor I 
(FcγRI) is expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and might contribute 
to pain in rodent models of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). This study was 
undertaken to elucidate the roles of nociceptive neuronal FcγRI-coupled 
signaling in the development of joint pain in AIA.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to investigate the transcriptome profile 
changes in the DRG in a rat model of AIA. A primary sensory neuron-specific 
Fcgr1a conditional-knockout (CKO) rat was established by crossing rats carrying 
a loxP-flanked Fcgr1a with a Pirt-specific Cre line. Behavioral, morphologic, 
and molecular studies were conducted to evaluate the differences between 
wild-type (WT) and CKO rats after AIA.
RESULTS: We first showed that AIA induced a transcriptome profile change in the 
DRG, involving a number of key proteins downstream of the FcγRI-related 
signaling pathway. Compared to the WT rats, both the IgG immune complex-induced 
acute pain and AIA-induced pain were alleviated in CKO rats. Moreover, the 
AIA-induced activation of FcγRI-related signaling in DRGs was significantly 
reduced in CKO rats. In addition, CKO rats showed attenuated joint swelling 
after AIA.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that activation of FcγRI-coupled signaling in 
DRG neurons plays an important role in the development of joint pain in AIA. Our 
findings may provide novel insights into the interactions between the peripheral 
nervous system and the immune system in pathologic conditions and might suggest 
potential biotargets for the treatment of pain in RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease for which 
treatment focuses on suppressing an overactive immune system and maintaining the 
physiological balance of synovial fibroblasts (SFs). We found that miR-30-5p was 
highly expressed in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). 
Subsequently, we predicted that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 
2 (PIK3R2) might be a putative target of miR-30-5p. Recent studies have reported 
that PIK3R2 can maintain the physiological homeostasis of RASFs. Therefore, 
miR-30-5p inhibitor has the potential to be used in the treatment of RA, but low 
levels of miR-30-5p inhibitor internalization affect its application. Triptolide 
(TP) is an effective drug in the treatment of RA but induces severe toxicity and 
has a narrow therapeutic window. In this study, the cell internalization 
performance of miR-30-5p inhibitor was improved by loading it into cell membrane 
penetrating peptide (CADY)-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), and 
the toxicity of TP was decreased by loading it into a controlled drug release 
system based on MSNs. The nanodrug carrier was constructed by filling a 
phase-change material (PCM) of 1-tetradecanol and drugs into MSNs that could be 
triggered by an NIR laser with thermo-chemo combination RA therapy. Our results 
show that the miR-30-5p inhibitor-loaded MSNs@CADY significantly inhibited RASF 
proliferation and increased apoptosis. In addition, MSNs@PCM@TP under 808 nm 
laser irradiation were effective in downregulating immune system activation in 
an RA rat model. Finally, the results of a pharmacodynamics study showed that 
the combination of MSNs@CADY@miR-30-5p inhibitor and MSNs@PCM@TP under 808 nm 
laser significantly increased the effectiveness of RA treatment. These findings 
provide a novel understanding of RA pathogenesis and a theoretical basis for RA 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: CD4+ T cells play a central role during the early stages of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but to which extent they are required for the 
perpetuation of the disease is still not fully understood. The aim of the 
current study was to obtain conclusive evidence that T cells drive chronic 
relapsing arthritis.
METHODS: We used the rat pristane-induced arthritis model, which accurately 
portrays the chronic relapsing-remitting disease course of RA, to examine the 
contribution of T cells to chronic arthritis.
RESULTS: Rats subjected to whole-body irradiation and injected with CD4+ T cells 
from lymph nodes of pristane-injected donors developed chronic arthritis that 
lasted for more than 4 months, whereas T cells from the spleen only induced 
acute disease. Thymectomy in combination with irradiation enhanced the severity 
of arthritis, suggesting that sustained lymphopenia promotes T cell-driven 
chronic inflammation in this model. The ability of T cells to induce chronic 
arthritis correlated with their expression of Th17-associated transcripts, and 
while depletion of T cells in rats with chronic PIA led to transient, albeit 
significant, reduction in disease, neutralization of IL-17 resulted in almost 
complete and sustained remission.
CONCLUSION: These findings show that, once activated, self-reactive T cells can 
sustain inflammatory responses for extended periods of time and suggest that 
such responses are promoted in the presence of IL-17.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease linked to 
oxidative stress, which is associated with significant morbidity. The NADPH 
oxidase complex (NOX) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are among the 
key markers for determining RA's pathophysiology. Therefore, understanding 
ROS-regulated molecular pathways and their interaction is necessary for 
developing novel therapeutic approaches for RA. Here, by combining mouse 
genetics and biochemistry with clinical tissue analysis, we reveal that in vivo 
Rubicon interacts with the p22phox subunit of NOX, which is necessary for 
increased ROS-mediated RA pathogenesis. Furthermore, we developed a series of 
new aryl propanamide derivatives consisting of tetrahydroindazole and 
thiadiazole as p22phox inhibitors and selected 
2-(tetrahydroindazolyl)phenoxy-N-(thiadiazolyl)propanamide 2 (TIPTP, M.W. 
437.44), which showed considerably improved potency, reaching an IC50 value up 
to 100-fold lower than an inhibitor that we previously synthesized reported N8 
peptide-mimetic small molecule (blocking p22phox-Rubicon interaction). Notably, 
TIPTP treatment showed significant therapeutic effects a mouse model for RA. 
Furthermore, TIPTP had anti-inflammatory effects ex vivo in monocytes from 
healthy individuals and synovial fluid cells from RA patients. These findings 
may have clinical applications for the development of TIPTP as a small molecule 
inhibitor of the p22phox-Rubicon axis for the treatment of ROS-driven diseases 
such as RA.

Neutrophils are one of the most abundant leukocytes in the sites of lesion of 
inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. These 
diseases are accompanied by bone loss, which worsens the quality of life of the 
patients. However, the role of neutrophils in the inflammatory bone loss has not 
been fully investigated. In the present study, we found that human neutrophils 
enhanced osteoclast differentiation from mouse bone marrow cells co-cultured 
with mouse osteoblasts in the presence of active vitamin D3. The enhanced 
osteoclast differentiation was significantly suppressed by elastatinal, a 
synthetic inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Also, we found that human 
neutrophils degraded human recombinant osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor 
for nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL), the essential osteoclast 
differentiation-inducing factor, expressed by osteoblasts. Degradation of OPG by 
neutrophils was suppressed by human α1-protease inhibitor, the major endogenous 
inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. Recombinant human neutrophil elastase degraded 
human OPG in its death domain-like region. These results indicated that the 
degradation of OPG by elastase contributed at least in part to the enhanced 
osteoclast differentiation by neutrophils. There is a possibility that 
neutrophils play an important role in inflammatory bone loss.

Multitarget nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitor (CAI) agents for the management of rheumatoid arthritis are reported. 
The evidence of the plasma stability of the amide-linked hybrids previously 
reported prompted us to investigate their pain-relieving mechanism of action. A 
bioisosteric amide to ester substitution yielded a series of derivatives showing 
potent target CAs inhibition and to undergo cleavage in rat or human plasma 
depending on the NSAID portion. A selection of derivatives were assayed in vitro 
to indirectly evaluate their effect on COX-1 and COX-2. MD simulations 
demonstrated that the entire hybrids are also able to efficiently bind the COX 
active site. In a rat model of RA, the most promising derivative (5c) showed 
major antihyperalgesic action compared with the equimolar coadministration of 
the single agents. The gathered data provided new insights on the action 
mechanism of these multitarget compounds, which induce markedly improved pain 
relief compared with the parent NSAIDs.

OBJECTIVE: CD6 is an important regulator of T cell function that interacts with 
the ligands CD166 and CD318. To further clarify the significance of CD6 in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we examined the effects of targeting CD6 in the mouse 
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), using CD6-knockout (CD6-KO) mice and 
CD6-humanized mice that express human CD6 in lieu of mouse CD6 on their T cells.
METHODS: We immunized wild-type (WT) and CD6 gene-KO mice with a collagen 
emulsion to induce CIA. For treatment studies using CD6-humanized mice, mice 
were immunized similarly and a mouse anti-human CD6 IgG (UMCD6) or control IgG 
was injected on days 7, 14, and 21. Joint tissues were evaluated for tissue 
damage, leukocyte infiltration, and local inflammatory cytokine production. 
Collagen-specific Th1, Th9, and Th17 responses and serum levels of 
collagen-specific IgG subclasses were also evaluated in WT and CD6-KO mice with 
CIA.
RESULTS: The absence of CD6 reduced 1) collagen-specific Th9 and Th17, but not 
Th1 responses, 2) the levels of many proinflammatory joint cytokines, and 3) 
serum levels of collagen-reactive total IgG and IgG1, but not IgG2a and IgG3. 
Joint homogenate hemoglobin content was significantly reduced in CD6-KO mice 
with CIA compared to WT mice with CIA (P < 0.05) (reduced angiogenesis). 
Moreover, treating CD6-humanized mice with mouse anti-human CD6 monoclonal 
antibody was similarly effective in reducing joint inflammation in CIA.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that interaction of CD6 with its 
ligands is important for the perpetuation of CIA and other inflammatory 
arthritides that are T cell driven.

The resistance of synovial sublining macrophages to apoptosis has a crucial role 
in joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the 
underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we report that 
inactivation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein BAD is essential for 
survival of synovial sublining macrophage in RA. Genetic disruption of Bad leads 
to more severe joint inflammation and cartilage and bone damage with reduced 
apoptosis of synovial sublining macrophages in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
and TNFα transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse models. Conversely, Bad3SA/3SA mice, in which 
BAD can no longer be inactivated by phosphorylation, are protected from 
collagen-induced arthritis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation-mediated 
inactivation of BAD specifically protects synovial sublining macrophages from 
apoptosis in highly inflammatory environment of arthritic joints in CIA and 
TNF-Tg mice, and in patients with RA, thereby contributing to RA pathology. Our 
findings put forward a model in which inactivation of BAD confers the apoptosis 
resistance on synovial sublining macrophages, thereby contributing to the 
development of arthritis, suggesting that BAD may be a potential therapeutic 
target for RA.

In the last decade, approaches based on T cells and their immunomodulatory 
receptors have emerged as a solid improvement in treatments for various types of 
cancer. However, the roles of these molecules in the therapeutic context of 
autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases are still relatively unexplored. Here, we 
review the best known and most commonly used immunomodulatory T cell receptors 
in clinical practice (PD-1 and CTLA-4), along with the rest of the receptors 
with known functions in animal models, which have great potential as modulators 
in human pathologies in the medium term. Among these other receptors is the 
receptor CD69, which has recently been described to be expressed in mouse and 
human T cells in autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, 
inhibition of these receptors individually or in combination by drugs or 
monoclonal antibodies generates a loss of immunological tolerance and can 
trigger multiple autoimmune disorders in different organs and immune-related 
adverse effects. In the coming decades, knowledge on the functions of different 
immunomodulatory receptors will be pivotal for the development of new and better 
therapies with less harmful side effects. In this review, we discuss the roles 
of these receptors in the control of immunity from a perspective focused on 
therapeutic potential in not only cancer but also autoimmune diseases, such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 
cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, 
and myocarditis.

BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is closely related with the 
pathological progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLSs) are known as its resistance against ER stress-induced 
apoptosis. Studies on overcoming such resistance would provide a novel treatment 
strategy for RA in a clinical setting.
METHODS: IL13Rα1 expression was assessed in the synovial tissue by RT-qPCR, 
immunohistology, and Western blot. Gain or loss of functional analysis was 
applied to evaluate the biological roles of IL13Rα1 in RA FLSs. Cell viability 
and apoptosis were assessed by MTS, Western blot, and flow cytometry. The 
therapeutic effects of IL13Rα1 on the severity of type II collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) in DBA-/1 mouse model were evaluated by scoring synovitis, 
hyperplasia, cartilage degradation, and bone destruction.
RESULTS: IL13Rα1 expression was selectively downregulated when RA FLSs were 
stimulated by ER stress inducers. Functionally, IL13Rα1 overexpression could 
inhibit the viability, but induce the apoptosis of RA FLSs in the presence of ER 
stress inducers. Mechanistically, IL13Rα1 promotes cell apoptosis via 
transcriptionally activating trail expression. Besides, IL13Rα1 could interact 
and stabilize DR5 protein, thus forming a positive loop involving trail and DR5 
to render RA FLSs more susceptible to apoptosis. Additionally, intraarticular 
injection of IL13Rα1 conferred therapeutic effects in CIA models and showed a 
limited degree of synovial proliferation and joint destruction.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data establishes a regulatory role for IL13Rα1 to 
combat the apoptotic resistance of RA FLSs against ER stress. The inhibitory 
effects of IL13Rα1 on arthritis progression suggest the therapeutic potential in 
RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic 
inflammation of synovial joints and often associated with chronic pain. Chronic 
joint inflammation is attributed to severe proliferation of synoviocytes and 
resident macrophages and infiltration of immune cells. These cells secrete 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 
6 (IL-6) and IL-17 to overcome actions of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby 
maintaining chronic inflammation and pain. The imbalance between 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (produced by M1 macrophages) and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines (produced by M2 macrophages) is a feature of RA progression, but the 
switch time of M1/M2 polarization and which receptor regulates the switch remain 
unsolved. Here we used an established RA mouse model to demonstrate that TNF-α 
expression was responsible for the initial acute stage of inflammation and pain 
(1-4 weeks), IL-17 expression the transition stage (4-12 weeks), and IL-6 
expression the later maintenance stage (> 12 weeks). The switch time of M1/M2 
polarization occurred at 4-8 weeks. We also identified a potential compound, 
anthra[2,1-c][1,2,5] thiadiazole-6,11-dione (NSC745885), that specifically 
inhibited T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) function and expression. 
NSC745885 decreased joint inflammation and destruction and attenuated pain by 
reducing cytokine production and regulating the M1/M2 polarization switch. TDAG8 
may participate in regulating the M1/M2 polarization and temporal expression of 
distinct cytokines to control RA progression.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease 
characterized by failure of spontaneous resolution of inflammation with lifetime 
perseverance, becoming principal cause of inactivity. Many conventional 
therapies are in use but the side effects associated with them are equally 
problematic. Therefore an urge to explore advanced therapeutic approaches with 
least adverse events has seeded the idea of discovering newer herbal drugs and 
their respective constituents in management of RA. The current research explores 
anti-arthritic activity of Terminalia catappa fruits hydroalcoholic extract in 
CFA induced Wistar rats.
METHODS: The fruits were obtained, washed, dried and processed to obtain 
hydroalcoholic powdered extract which was dissolved in water and given orally to 
the rats. Wistar rats of either sex were used in the study. The animals were 
injected with 0.1 ml of complete freund's adjuvant (CFA) in footpad of left hind 
paw. The treatment was initiated from day 0 by oral dosing of Terminalia catappa 
fruit extract in doses of 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg followed by CFA administration 
to day 21 and behavioral, hematological parameters besides histopathological 
screening were assessed simultaneously.
RESULTS: The arthritic symptoms were observed to gradually decrease in treatment 
groups when compared against disease control groups. The parameters like body 
weight and pain latency were increased whereas paw volume and arthritic score 
were found to significantly decrease in treatment groups as compared to disease 
control group. The hematological parameters were also modified and were studied 
in treatment groups. The histopathological estimation depicted extent of damage 
in joint tissue of diseased rat comparable to normal, standard and combination 
therapy group.
CONCLUSION: The fruits possess anti-arthritic properties and significantly 
reduced paw volume, arthritic score and increased pain threshold and body weight 
gain besides theory hematological effects like increase in Hb and RBC and 
decrease in WBC, platelets and ESR levels simultaneously. The histopathological 
estimation confirmed decreased deterioration of joint tissue in treatment groups 
as compared to disease control group hence proving to be an emerging therapeutic 
option in management of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease. Wasp venom (WV), which is 
considered as a traditional folk medicine in Jingpo nationality in Yunnan, 
China, relieves rheumatoid arthritis. The current study aimed to investigate the 
effect of wasp venom ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis symptoms in experimental 
rats. We established a model of type II collagen- (CII-) induced arthritis (CIA) 
in SD rats and examined the inhibition of inflammation and autoimmune response. 
The antiarthritic effects of WV were evaluated through the paw swelling, and 
histopathological score and histopathology changes of the affected paw were 
assessed. The anti-inflammation effects were assayed by the level of IL-6, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and the number of inflammatory cells in peripheral blood. The 
alteration of the T cell subset ratio in the spleen of rats was detected by flow 
cytometry, and at the same time, the viscera index and immune serum globulin 
levels were evaluated. The results suggested that various doses of WV (0.125, 
0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg) significantly alleviated paw swelling and arthritis score 
in CIA rats with the untreated control (P < 0.05). WV (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) 
relieved synovial tissue lesions of ankle joints and histopathology scores of 
synoviocyte hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration with vehicle group (P 
< 0.05). Regarding immunological regulation, 0.5 mg/kg WV lowered the immune 
serum globulin levels (P < 0.05), and we further found that WV (0.5 mg/kg) 
suppressed the immune response of Th cells, while enhancing the functions of Tc 
cells and Treg cells in spleen cells markedly (P < 0.05). The immunosuppressive 
action of WV displayed was analogous to its inhibitory effect on IL-1β, TNF-α, 
IL-8, IL-6, COX-2, and PGE2 levels in rat serum. In conclusion, these findings 
demonstrated that WV exhibited antiarthritic activity, which might be associated 
with their inhibitory effects on immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory action.

OBJECTIVE: To study the roles and underlying mechanisms of long non-coding 
ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) H19 in the synovial cell proliferation and apoptosis 
in rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided 
into Control group and Model group. The rat model of RA was induced by using 
type II collagen in Model group. The primary synovial cells were isolated from 
the synovial tissues of the rats and were assigned into Control group, Model 
group, and lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention group. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine 
(EdU) staining was applied to detect cell proliferation in each group. Terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining 
was employed to determine the cell apoptosis in each group. Western blotting 
assay was adopted to measure the expression levels of Notch1 and hairy/enhancer 
of split-1 (Hes1) in each group of cells.
RESULTS: The RA score of the Model group was higher than that of the Control 
group. Compared to the Control group, the expression of lncRNA H19, Notch, and 
Hes1 of the synovial cells in the Model group were significantly elevated. 
Besides, the cell proliferation rate of the Model was also increased, while the 
cell apoptosis rate was decreased compared with those in the Control group. 
Moreover, in comparison with Model group, lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention 
group exhibited a lowered lncRNA H19 level, remarkably reduced cell 
proliferation rate and protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1, as well as notably 
raised cell apoptosis rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that lncRNA H19 inhibitor could repress the 
proliferation and promote the apoptosis of synovial cells in RA rats, which 
might be attributed to the inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway.

Studies have found that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (Ndrg2) is involved in 
the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the specific mechanism 
still remains unclear. Gene expression profiles in the tibial joints of the 
collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis model were obtained using Gene Expression 
Omnibus database. Western blot and real-time PCR were respectively performed to 
determine the expression of Ndrg2 and gene messenger RNA. Cell viability was 
measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method, and cell cycle was detected by 
flow cytometry. Cell scratch assays were carried out to detect migration. The 
binding ability of miR-130a to Ndrg2-3'-UTR was predicted by TargetScan website 
and confirmed by dual luciferase assay. A collagen-induced arthritis rat model 
was constructed to observe the effects of miR-130a on arthritis index, hind limb 
swelling, volume of rat hind paw, and inflammation. Ndrg2 was found 
downregulated in RA tissues, and knockdown of Ndrg2 promoted fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLS) proliferation and inflammation, while overexpressed Ndrg2 
produced opposite results. Ndrg2 was predicted as a target gene for miR-130a, 
and miR-130a mimic promoted FLS proliferation, while miR-130a inhibitor 
suppressed FLS proliferation. Moreover, we found that miR-130a antagomir could 
significantly reduce the arthritis index, swelling degree, foot volume, and 
inflammatory factor levels; inhibit the expression of miR-130a; and promote the 
expression of Ndrg2. The miR-130a/Ndrg2 axis signaling pathway is involved in 
the progression of RA. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical 
treatment of RA.

AIMS: To analyze the prostatic compartments, extracellular matrix, 
microvascularization, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and angiotensin II 
receptors type 1 (AT1) levels, and histopathology of the ventral prostate in a 
rat model for rheumatoid arthritis, and to evaluate the effect of angiotensin II 
AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) in the disease.
MAIN METHODS: Fifteen male rats (90 days old) were divided into three groups 
(n = 5/group): control, adjuvant-induced arthritis without (AIA) or with AT1 
receptor blocker (AIA + ARB). Animals were euthanized 60 days after 
immunization. The ventral prostate was collected, weighed, and processed for 
histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results show that AIA increases production of the prostatic 
epithelium and extracellular matrix, accompanied by a reduction in the number of 
tissue capillaries. ARB treatment promotes decreased production of extracellular 
matrix and increased TGF-β and AT1 receptor immunostaining.
SIGNIFICANCE: AIA may activate specific mechanisms that modify the prostatic 
environment; the use of ARB attenuates some altered prostate parameters in a rat 
model for arthritis.

Current treatments for chronic immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, or Crohn's disease commonly rely on cytokine 
neutralization using monoclonal antibodies; however, such approaches have 
drawbacks. Frequent repeated dosing can lead to the formation of anti-drug 
antibodies and patient compliance issues, and it is difficult to identify a 
single antibody that is broadly efficacious across diverse patient populations. 
As an alternative to monoclonal antibody therapy, anti-cytokine immunization is 
a potential means for long-term therapeutic control of chronic inflammatory 
diseases. Here we report a supramolecular peptide-based approach for raising 
antibodies against IL-17 and demonstrate its efficacy in a murine model of 
psoriasis. B-cell epitopes from IL-17 were co-assembled with the universal 
T-cell epitope PADRE using the Q11 self-assembling peptide nanofiber system. 
These materials, with or without adjuvants, raised antibody responses against 
IL-17. Exploiting the modularity of the system, multifactorial experimental 
designs were used to select formulations maximizing titer and avidity. In a 
mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod, unadjuvanted nanofibers had 
therapeutic efficacy, which could be enhanced with alum adjuvant but reversed 
with CpG adjuvant. Measurements of antibody subclass induced by adjuvanted and 
unadjuvanted formulations revealed strong correlations between therapeutic 
efficacy and titers of IgG1 (improved efficacy) or IgG2b (worsened efficacy). 
These findings have important implications for the development of anti-cytokine 
active immunotherapies and suggest that immune phenotype is an important metric 
for eliciting therapeutic anti-cytokine antibody responses.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating and painful inflammatory autoimmune 
disease characterised by the accumulation of leukocytes in the synovium, 
cartilage destruction and bone erosion. The immunomodulatory effects of bone 
marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been widely studied and the 
recent observations that syndecan-3 (SDC3) is selectively pro-inflammatory in 
the joint led us to hypothesise that SDC3 might play an important role in MSC 
biology. MSCs isolated from bone marrow of wild type and Sdc3-/- mice were used 
to assess immunophenotype, differentiation, adhesion and migration properties 
and cell signalling pathways. While both cell types show similar differentiation 
potential and forward scatter values, the cell complexity in wild type MSCs was 
significantly higher than in Sdc3-/- cells and was accompanied by lower spread 
surface area. Moreover, Sdc3-/- MSCs adhered more rapidly to collagen type I and 
showed a dramatic increase in AKT phosphorylation, accompanied by a decrease in 
ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared with control cells. In a mouse model of 
antigen-induced inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular injection of Sdc3-/- MSCs 
yielded enhanced efficacy compared to injection of wild type MSCs. In 
conclusion, our data suggest that syndecan-3 regulates MSC adhesion and efficacy 
in inflammatory arthritis, likely via induction of the AKT pathway.

The pleiotropic effects of statins, including an antiarthritic potential, have 
been noted. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of statins on rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and clarify how statins affect its pathogenesis. Fluvastatin 
(500 μg/kg/day) or vehicle was given per os to env-pX rats, which carry the 
human T-cell leukemia virus type I env-pX gene and spontaneously develop 
destructive arthritis mimicking RA, for 30 days. Blood sampling and 
ultrasonography (US) of the ankle joints were conducted on days 0, 10, 20, and 
30. On day 30, all rats were euthanized, and the ankle joints were subjected to 
histological analysis. To clarify how fluvastatin affects the pathogenesis of 
RA, comprehensive serum exosomal microRNA (miRNA) analysis was performed. Gene 
expression in the primary culture of synovial fibroblasts derived from arthritic 
rat and human and non-arthritic rat periarticular tissues was determined 
quantitatively by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR). As a result, the development of arthritis in env-pX rats was 
significantly suppressed by fluvastatin, which was evident from the viewpoints 
of serology, US imaging, and histology. Comprehensive serum exosomal miRNA 
analysis suggested that the expression of Rho GTPase-activating protein 12 
(Arhgap12) was decreased in arthritic env-pX rats but increased with the 
administration of fluvastatin. Corresponding results were obtained by 
quantitative RT- PCR using primary culture of synovial fibroblasts. The 
collective findings suggest that fluvastatin prevents the development of 
arthritis in env-pX rats via the up-regulation of ARHGAP12. This study suggests 
that ARHGAP12 can be a possible therapeutic target of RA.

There is growing evidence that some parasitic infections can impact a variety of 
autoimmune diseases by disease-inducing or protecting capacities. 
Anti-inflammatory molecules secreted by Toxoplasma gondii and other parasites 
are capable of preventing some autoimmune disease like arthritis, lupus 
nephritis and systemic lupus erythematosus by acting on the immune system. Here 
we aimed to evaluate the protective efficacy of vaccination with Toxoplasma 
gondii (T. gondii), either gamma radiation-attenuated or not, on an adjuvant 
arthritis mouse model. Forty female Swiss albino mice were conducted in 
experiment divided into normal control; mice were injected with Complete 
Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the right hind paws; mice vaccinated with 
irradiated T. gondii in the 3rd group and un-irradiated T. gondii in the 4th 
group then were injected two weeks later with CFA. Histopathological changes and 
IL-17, STAT6 and ROR-γ levels in the joints, as well as serum survivin and 
Anti-CCP, were evaluated. Also, the splenic production of TGF-β1, TGF-βR, IL-23, 
IL-1β, IFN-γ, TFN-∞, NFKβ, MMP1 and MMP3 were assessed. Results exhibited an 
enhancement of the histopathological changes with diminished the rise of IL-17, 
STAT 6 and ROR- γ within the joints of both vaccinated groups. Also, serum 
survivin and Anti-CCP, as well as splenic inflammatory cytokines were reduced. 
It can be concluded that vaccination with un-irradiated or radiation-attenuated 
T. gondii exerted a protective effect against adjuvant arthritis with better 
pathological achievement in the radiation-attenuated vaccinated group. Using 
gamma radiation-attenuated parasite to exclude the delirious effects of imposing 
infection of live one may pave the way to new preventative modality against 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Fangchinoline (FAN) is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is widely known for 
its anti-tumor properties. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of 
FAN on arthritis and the possible pathways it acts on. Human fibroblast-like 
synovial cells (FLS), carrageenan/ kaolin arthritis rat model (C/K), and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model were used to establish the 
efficiency of FAN in arthritis. Human FLS cells were treated with FAN (1, 2.5, 
5, 10 μM) 1 h before IL-1β (10 ng/mL) stimulation. Cell viability, reactive 
oxygen species measurement, and western blot analysis of inflammatory mediators 
and the MAPK and NF-κB pathways were performed. In the animal models, after 
induction of arthritis, the rodents were given 10 and 30 mg/kg of FAN orally 1 h 
before conducting behavioral experiments such as weight distribution ratio, knee 
thickness measurement, squeaking score, body weight measurement, paw volume 
measurement, and arthritis index measurement. Rodent knee joints were also 
analyzed histologically through H&E staining and safranin staining. FAN 
decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines and ROS in human FLS cells as 
well as the phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway and NF-κB pathway in human FLS 
cells. The behavioral parameters in the C/K rat model and CIA mouse model and 
inflammatory signs in the histological analysis were found to be ameliorated in 
FAN-treated groups. Cartilage degradation in CIA mice knee joints were shown to 
have been suppressed by FAN. These findings suggest that fangchinoline has the 
potential to be a therapeutic source for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Reversible lysine acetylation of histones is a key epigenetic regulatory process 
controlling gene expression. Reversible histone acetylation is mediated by two 
opposing enzyme families: histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone 
deacetylases (HDACs). Moreover, many non-histone targets of HATs and HDACs are 
known, suggesting a crucial role for lysine acetylation as a posttranslational 
modification on the cellular proteome and protein function far beyond 
chromatin-mediated gene regulation. The HDAC family consists of 18 members and 
pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are clinically used for the treatment of certain 
types of cancer. HDACi or individual HDAC member-deficient (cell 
lineage-specific) mice have also been tested in a large number of preclinical 
mouse models for several autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases and in most 
cases HDACi treatment results in an attenuation of clinical disease severity. A 
reduction of disease severity has also been observed in mice lacking certain 
HDAC members. This indicates a high therapeutic potential of isoform-selective 
HDACi for immune-mediated diseases. Isoform-selective HDACi and thus targeted 
inactivation of HDAC isoforms might also overcome the adverse effects of current 
clinically approved pan-HDACi. This review provides a brief overview about the 
fundamental function of HDACs as epigenetic regulators, highlights the roles of 
HDACs beyond chromatin-mediated control of gene expression and summarizes the 
studies showing the impact of HDAC inhibitors and genetic deficiencies of HDAC 
members for the outcome of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases with a focus 
on rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model of multiple sclerosis.

It has been reported that taxifolin inhibit osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 
cells. In our research, the inhibition effects of taxifolin on the 
osteoclastogenesis of human bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) induced by 
receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) as well as the protection effects in 
lipopolysaccharide-induced bone lysis mouse model have been demonstrated. In 
vitro, taxifolin inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation of human 
BMMs without cytotoxicity. Moreover, taxifolin significantly suppressed 
RANKL-induced gene expression, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, 
matrix metalloproteinase-9 nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and cathepsin 
K, and F-actin ring formation. Further studies showed that taxifolin inhibit 
osteoclastogenesis via the suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In vivo, 
taxifolin prevented bone loss in mouse calvarial osteolysis model. In 
conclusion, the results suggested that taxifolin has a therapeutic potential for 
osteoclastogenesis-related diseases such as osteoporosis, osteolysis, and 
rheumatoid arthritis.

China.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a disorder of joints featuring inflammation and 
degeneration of articular cartilage. Recently, miRs have been found to be 
associated in the regulation of chondrocytes and their apoptosis. miR-18a-3p has 
been found to be associated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, 
however, its role in articular cartilage tissues remains unclear.
METHODS: C57BL/6 strain of mice and human cartilage tissue were used for the 
study. Histological analysis was done on isolated cartilage samples followed by 
TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical analysis. The chondrocytes were isolated 
from mouse and human cartilage tissues, RNA was isolated and subjected for 
qRT-PCR analysis. The chondrocytes were transfected with miR-18a-3p agomir, 
antagomir and siHOXA-1. Luciferase assay was done in 293T cells. Flow cytometry 
analysis was done and western blot analysis for studying the expression of 
proteins.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-18a-3p was upregulated in chondrocytes after 
exposing them to interlukin- 1β (IL-1β) in vitro. The transfection of miR-18a-3p 
antagomir halted the IL-1β mediated apoptosis. The luciferase assay suggested 
that miR-18a-3p targets the 3'UTR region of HOXA1 gene thus blocking its 
expression. The treatment of HOXA1 siRNA demonstrated the rescuing effect of 
miR- 18a-3p antagomir on the apoptosis of chondrocytes. Treatment of miR-18a-3p 
antagomir attenuated the surface of cartilage in osteoarthritis mice and the 
agomir worsened it. TUNEL assay suggested decreased apoptosis and 
over-expression of HOAX1 in osteoarthritis mice post miR-18a-3p knockdown.
CONCLUSION: The findings confirmed the involvement of miR-18a-3p/HOXA1 pathway 
as a potential mechanism in the regulation of Osteoarthritis.

OBJECTIVES: As one of the main active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicine 
Andrographis paniculate, andrographolide is used in domestic clinical treatment 
for respiratory infections and inflammation. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of andrographolide as an antioxidant on the level of 
oxidative stress, neutrophil accumulation and infiltration in joints and 
synovial tissue of arthritis rats induced by complete freund's adjuvant.
METHODS: A rat model of rheumatoid arthritis was induced by subcutaneous 
injection of complete Freund's adjuvant in the footpad. The model was 
established 14 days after induction. The treatment was performed from 14th day 
to 35th day with different doses of andrographolide (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) and 
positive control methotrexate (3 mg/kg). The effects of andrographolide on 
oxidative stress, neutrophil accumulation and infiltration were measured by the 
paw swelling, arthritis score, the hot plate test, biochemical analysis, and 
histology.
RESULTS: The medium and high-dose andrographolide (50, 100 mg/kg) group declined 
the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and CXC chemokine ligand2, 
articular elastase and myeloperoxidase, and increased the levels of antioxidant 
enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione. The activity of 
malondialdehyde and nitrite/nitrate in andrographolide (50, 100 mg/kg) group was 
weakened than the model group. The degree of swelling and arthritis score of 
andrographolide group was lower than the model group. The results of hot plate 
test showed that high dose of andrographolide significantly improved the 
anti-injury ability of rats; Radiological and histological results showed that 
the joint osteoporosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, synovial hyperplasia and 
other phenomena in the andrographolide group were significantly improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Andrographolide acts as a protective agent for the treatment of 
complete freund's adjuvant induced rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting lipid 
peroxidation and nitrite/nitrate levels in a dose-dependent manner, enhancing 
antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing levels of chemokines and inflammatory 
factors, preventing neutrophil accumulation and infiltration.

Interleukin (IL)-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine mainly produced by 
regulatory T cells. IL-35 mediates immunological functions by suppressing the 
inflammatory immune response. However, the role of IL-35 in bone-destructive 
diseases remains unclear, especially in terms of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, 
the current study investigated the synergistic effect of IL-35 on 
osteoclastogenesis that is involved the pathogeneses of periodontitis and 
rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoclastic differentiation and osteoclastogenesis of 
RAW264 (RAW) cells induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB 
ligand (RANKL) and IL-35 were evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphate 
staining, hydroxyapatite resorption assays, and quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction. The effect of IL-35 on RANKL-stimulated signaling pathways was 
assessed by Western blot analysis. Costimulation of RAW cells by RANKL and IL-35 
induced osteoclastogenesis significantly compared with stimulation by RANKL 
alone. Phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase tended to be increased by RANKL and IL-35 
compared with RANKL or IL-35 alone. Additionally, the osteoclastogenesis induced 
by RANKL and IL-35 was suppressed by inhibition of ERK. In this study, IL-35 and 
RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis synergistically. Previous reports have shown 
that IL-35 suppresses the differentiation of osteoclasts. Therefore, IL-35 might 
play dual roles of destruction and protection in osteoclastogenesis.

The osteoclast is the unique type of cell that resorbs bone in vivo and it is 
required for normal skeletal development and postnatal homeostasis. Osteoclast 
deficiency impairs skeletal development during embryogenesis and results in 
osteopetrosis and impaired tooth eruption. In contrast, excessive osteoclast 
formation in adults results in bone loss in a number of conditions, including 
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metastatic bone disease. Osteoclasts are 
derived from monocytes/macrophages; they can be generated in vitro by treatment 
of these precursor cells with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and 
receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). This chapter describes procedures 
for generating osteoclasts from mouse bone marrow cells in vitro using M-CSF and 
RANKL and assessing their ability to form resorption lacunae on thin bone 
slices.

The autonomic nervous system innervates all lymphoid tissues including the 
spleen therefore providing a link between the central nervous system and the 
immune system. The only known mechanism of neural inhibition of inflammation in 
the spleen relies on the production of norepinephrine by splenic 
catecholaminergic fibers which binds to β2-adrenergic receptors (β 2-ARs) of 
CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells trigger the release of acetylcholine that 
inhibits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages through α7 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchRs) signaling. While the vagal 
anti-inflammatory pathway has been extensively studied in rodents, it remains to 
be determined whether it coexists with other neural pathways. Here, we have 
found that three nerve branches project to the spleen in mice. While two of 
these nerves are associated with an artery and contain catecholaminergic fibers, 
the third is located at the apex of the spleen and contain both 
catecholaminergic and cholinergic fibers. We found that electrical stimulation 
of the apical nerve, but not the arterial nerves, inhibited inflammation 
independently of lymphocytes. In striking contrast to the anti-inflammatory 
pathway mechanism described so far, we also found that the inhibition of 
inflammation by apical nerve electrical stimulation relied on signaling by both 
β 2-ARs and α7nAchRs in myeloid cells, with these two signaling pathways acting 
in parallel. Most importantly, apical splenic nerve electrical stimulation 
mitigated clinical symptoms in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis further 
providing the proof-of-concept that such an approach could be beneficial in 
patients with Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of citrullinated epitopes in articular 
cartilage protein and whether its expression is sufficient to induce 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) response in mice.
METHODS: The experimental group was treated with different concentrations of 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-inactivated bacteria (Escherichia coli and 
Staphylococcus aureus) or specific monoclonal antibody against type Ⅱ collagen 
to induce citrullination of articular cartilage protein, with PBS as the 
control. Immunohistochemistry with the monoclonal antibody ACC4 (IgG1) that 
specifically binds to the citrullinated epitope of cartilage protein was 
performed for detecting the expression of citrullinated protein, with ACC1 
(IgG2a) as a positive control antibody and L243 (IgG2a) and Hy2.15 (IgG1) as the 
negative isotype control. In the in vivo experiment, SD rats were subjected to 
injection of different doses of LPS in the right knee (with PBS as the controls 
in the left knee), and 3 days later frozen sections were prepared for 
immunohistochemical detection of the expression of citrullinated protein. Models 
of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) established in different mouse strains were 
observed for incidence and severity of CIA. Serum samples collected from these 
models and the sera from rheumatoid arthritis patients were examined for 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody, and immunohistochemistry was performed to 
detect the expression of citrullinated protein in the cartilage of the mouse.
RESULTS: The citrullinated CII epitope-specific antibody ACC4 did not bind to 
articular cartilage tissues with different treatments as compared with the 
positive control antibody ACC1. The ACC4 antibody and the antibodies from 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis with high titers of anti-citrullinated 
protein antibody were capable of binding to the synovial tissue around the 
articular cartilage of the CIA. Luminex analysis showed that the 
anti-citrullinated protein antibody was lowly expressed in mouse serum, but the 
anti-type Ⅱ collagen triple helix structure peptide antibody exhibited strong 
reactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild acute inflammatory response is not enough to cause 
citrullination of articular cartilage protein, and the expression of specific 
epitope requires a high-intensity inflammatory response. Inflammatory articular 
cartilage protein can express citrullinated epitopes in type Ⅱ collagen-induced 
arthritis in mice, but the expression of citrullinated epitopes is not 
sufficient to induce an immune response to anti-citrullinated antibodies. 
Stronger stimulation signals are required to induce an immune response for 
producing anti-citrullinated protein antibodies.

目的: 探讨关节软骨蛋白瓜氨酸表位的表达情况，以及瓜氨酸化表位对抗瓜氨酸蛋白抗体（ACPAs）的免疫应答的影响。
方法: 
体外诱导实验：实验组加不同浓度梯度的脂多糖、热灭活细菌（大肠杆菌、金色葡萄球菌）或二型胶原（CII）特异性单克隆抗体等不同刺激物诱导体外培养关节软骨蛋白瓜氨酸化，等量PBS作为对照组，利用特异性结合瓜氨酸化表位的单克隆抗体ACC4（IgG1）进行免疫组织化学染色，ACC1（IgG2a）作为阳性对照，Hy2.15（IgG1）和L243（IgG2a）分别作为同型阴性对照，显微镜下观察瓜氨酸化蛋白表达；体内诱导实验：SD大鼠右膝关节内注射不同浓度脂多糖作为实验组，左膝关节内注射等量PBS为对照组，3 
d后取膝关节组织，制成冰冻切片，利用上述抗体进行免疫组化染色，显微镜下观察瓜氨酸化蛋白表达；建立不同种系的胶原诱导性关节炎（CIA）小鼠模型，评价其疾病发生率和严重程度，同时收集小鼠血清与高滴度抗瓜氨酸化抗体的类风湿性关节炎患者血清，采用液相芯片技术检测小鼠及类风湿患者血清中抗瓜氨酸化蛋白抗体水平，并用免疫组织化学检测关节炎小鼠关节软骨瓜氨酸化蛋白的表达水平。
结果: 
特异性结合瓜氨酸化CII表位的ACC4抗体未能结合至经不同诱导的关节软骨组织；与健康对照组相比，ACC4抗体和含高滴度的抗瓜氨酸化蛋白抗体的类风湿性关节炎患者血清中的抗体均能结合至CIA小鼠关节炎症关节软骨周围的滑膜组织；成功构建不同种系小鼠类风湿性关节炎模型，其发病率和疾病严重程度无统计学差异（P＞0.05）；液相芯片技术分析结果显示，小鼠血清中的抗瓜氨酸化抗体低表达或几乎不表达，但抗CII三螺旋结构多肽的抗体反应性较强。
结论: 
轻度急性炎症反应不足以引起关节软骨蛋白瓜氨酸化，其特异性抗原表位的表达需要高强度的炎症反应。二型胶原诱导的小鼠关节炎模型中炎症关节软骨蛋白可表达瓜氨酸化抗原表位，但瓜氨酸化抗原表位的表达不足以引起小鼠体内抗瓜氨酸化抗体的免疫应答，其免疫应答需要更多的刺激信号来诱导。

BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate agent which is widely used in 
clinic for treating malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis and ectopic pregnancy. As 
reported, MTX has side effects on gastrointestinal system, nervous system and 
reproductive system, while its potential damages on oocyte quality are still 
unclear. It is known that oocyte quality is essential for healthy conception and 
the forthcoming embryo development. Thus, this work studied the effects of MTX 
on the oocyte quality.
RESULTS: We established MTX model mice by single treatment with 5 mg/Kg MTX. 
Both morphological and molecular biology studies were performed to assess the 
in-vivo matured oocytes quality and to analyze the related mechanisms. The 
in-vivo matured oocytes from MTX-treated mice had poor in-vitro fertilization 
ability, and the resulting embryo formation rates and blastocyst quality were 
lower than the control group. We found that the in-vivo matured MTX-treated 
mouse oocytes displayed abnormal transcript expressions for genes of key enzymes 
in the folate cycles. MTX increased the rate of abnormal chromosome alignment 
and affected the regulation of chromosome separation via disrupting the spindle 
morphology and reducing the mRNA expressions of MAD2 and Sgo1. MTX reduced the 
DNA methylation levels in the in-vivo matured oocytes, and further studies 
showed that MTX altered the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT 3b, and may also 
affect the levels of the methyl donor and its metabolite.
CONCLUSIONS: MTX impaired the in-vivo matured mouse oocyte quality by disturbing 
folate metabolism and affecting chromosome stability and methylation 
modification.

Micro RNA-146 (miR-146) is involved in mediating many innate and adaptive immune 
and inflammatory responses in the body. It is associated with a variety of 
systemic inflammation or autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 2 diabetes. In recent years, microRNAs 
(miRNAs) and nanotechnology have become research hotspots in cardiovascular 
pathology. The close relationship between host miRNAs and coxsackie virus B3 has 
gradually been discovered by scientists, which may provide new directions for 
the treatment and prevention of viral myocarditis. At the same time, recent 
studies have also found that nano-α-linolenic acid and its metabolites can 
inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-17; At the 
same time, they also have anti-lipid peroxidation effects. Therefore, in order 
to further explore the role of miR-146 and nano-α-linolenic acid in the 
occurrence and development of viral myocarditis, in this study, a mouse model of 
viral myocarditis was used to establish a VMC mouse model using coxsackie virus 
B3. Intervention with different doses of nano-α-linolenic acid, the control 
group was injected with the same amount of sodium chloride buffer, and the 
changes in cardiac function and inflammation indexes were compared to evaluate 
the role in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. The results showed that this 
study suggested that serum miR-146 concentration in viral myocarditis mice is 
increased and is positively correlated with serum IL-17 and TNF-α 
concentrations. This suggest that miR-146 in the circulation may be involved in 
the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis through IL-17 and TNF-α, providing a 
theoretical basis for the role of miR-146 in viral myocarditis, but its specific 
mechanism of action needs to be further studied. At the same time, the research 
in this experiment showed that nano-α-linolenic acid significantly improves the 
survival rate of CVB3 infected mice and reduces myocardial damage. And with the 
increase of the dosage of nano-α-linolenic acid, the effect is more significant, 
showing a significant dose-effect relationship.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with joint 
inflammation and destruction driven by T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Interleukin-6 
(IL-6) is secreted by many cell types, including macrophages and synovial 
fibroblasts. It induces the differentiation and function of Th17 cells that can 
increase lymphocytic infiltration in the joint. LMT-28 can suppress IL-6 
signalling through direct binding to glycoprotein-130 and alleviate inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. The 
purpose of this study was to assess whether LMT-28 could potently inhibit Th17 
differentiation and to determine the mechanism involved in the attenuating 
effect of LMT-28 on rheumatoid arthritis through the IL-6 signalling pathway. 
LMT-28 reduced the arthritis score and showed protective effects against bone 
and cartilage destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. In mice with 
CIA, LMT-28 markedly decreased serum levels of IL-6, TNF and IL-1β compared to 
vehicle control. Moreover, LMT-28 attenuated Th17 cell activation in lymph nodes 
of CIA mice. We demonstrated that LMT-28 suppressed differentiation of Th17 in 
mouse splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 
Additionally, LMT-28 inhibited phosphorylation of GP130, STAT3 and ERK induced 
by Hyper-IL-6 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Collectively, these 
results suggest that LMT-28 can inhibit differentiated/activated-Th17 cells in 
rheumatoid arthritis by blocking activation of the STAT3 pathway. LMT-28 can 
attenuate rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting differentiation/activation of Th17 
cells and suppressing the proliferation and signalling activation of the 
IL-6/solubleIL-6 receptor complex stimulated FLS.

The lacrimal gland is critical for maintaining the homeostasis of the ocular 
surface microenvironment through secreting aqueous tears in mammals. Many 
systemic diseases such as Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes 
can alter the lacrimal gland function, eventually resulting in aqueous 
tear-deficient dry eye. Here, a high-fat diet (HFD) experimental mouse model was 
used to clarify how hyperlipidemia affects lacrimal gland function. Aqueous tear 
secretion fell about 50% after 1 month on a HFD. Lipid droplets accumulated in 
the matrix and acinar cells of the lacrimal gland after this period, along with 
changes in the lipid metabolism, changes in gene expression levels, and 
disruption of fatty acid oxidative activity. Immune cell infiltration and rises 
in the gene expression levels of the inflammation-related cytokines Il1β, Tnfα, 
Tsg6, Il10, Mmp2, and Mmp9 were found. HFD also induced mitochondrial 
hypermegasoma, increased apoptosis, and decreased lacrimal gland acinar cell 
proliferation. Replacement of the HFD with the standard diet partially reversed 
pathologic changes in the lacrimal gland. Similarly, supplementing the HFD with 
fenofibrate also partially reversed the inhibited tear secretion and reduced 
lipid accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress levels. The authors 
conclude that a HFD induces pathophysiological changes and functional 
decompensation of the lacrimal gland. Therefore, ingestion of a HFD may be a 
causative factor of dry eye disease.

Low drug concentrations at interest sites and unwanted systemic side effects are 
major obstacles to effective therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). With the aim 
of improving the efficacy of tofacitinib citrate (TOF), a liposomal system was 
developed for targeted delivery to inflamed joints, and this approach was 
validated in a RA rat model. TOF was effectively loaded into the liposomes 
(entrapment efficiency: 86.5±1.9%; drug loading: 2.3±0.05%) by a pH gradient 
method, and these molecules featured sustained drug release behaviour over 48 h. 
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that TOF loaded liposomes (TOFL) could be 
selectively taken up by inflamed cells and showed improved accumulation in 
arthritic paws, demonstrating the superior target ability to RA tissues. 
Moreover, compared to free TOF, TOFL significantly improved the therapeutic 
efficacy, reduced the inflammatory cytokine expression and lipid peroxidation in 
synovial cells in the joint tissue of RA rats. Overall, these results indicate 
that TOFL served as the useful nanocarriers for RA-targeted therapy.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease classified by uncontrolled 
joint inflammation leading to the destruction of both cartilage and joints. 
Despite progress made in RA treatment in the past decade, new drugs with high 
efficacy and fewer long-term adverse effects are still needed; thus, safe 
anti-inflammatory therapies for RA are urgently needed. Previous results 
demonstrated that the CXCR3 antagonist is an extremely attractive therapeutic 
target for the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, suggesting that it 
might have an inhibitory effect on RA. In this study, we investigated the effect 
of AMG487, a selective CXCR3 antagonist, on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in 
mice and evaluated its potential therapeutic mechanism.Following induction of 
CIA, mice were treated with AMG487 (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), to investigate 
their protective effects against CIA. CD4, CD25, CCR6, IL-9, NF-κB, IL-6, 
IL-17A, IL-21, STAT6 and Foxp3 expressing GITR+ and CD45+ cells were measured in 
the spleen using flow cytometry to assess anti-inflammatory effects of AMG487. 
The mRNA and protein expression of GITR, CCR6, IL-9, and IL-21 were measured 
using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis in knee tissue. 
AMG487 significantly alleviated joint inflammation by decreasing GITR+CD25+, 
GITR+CD45+, GITR+IL-9+, GITR+NF-κB+ CD45+CD4+, CD45+CCR6+, CD45+IL-6+ cells, 
CD45+IL-17A+, and CD45+IL-21+, and increasing GITR+Foxp3+ and GITR+STAT6+ cells. 
There was a significant decrease in mRNA and protein expression of GITR, CD4, 
CCR6, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-21 in knee tissue of CIA mice. This study demonstrates 
that AMG487 has a potential therapeutic effect on RA and could explore novel 
anti-inflammatory therapies for its treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disease, deprives patients' 
walking ability and reduces their life quality worldwide. Though recent studies 
have indicated the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ZFAS1 in several 
diseases, however, its role in RA remains uncharacterized. The present study 
aimed to unravel the the effect of ZFAS1 on RA. Herein, the RA mouse model and 
the human RA synoviocyte MH7A cell lines stimulated with TNF-α were established. 
ZFAS1 was next determined to be highly expressed in the mice with RA-like 
symptoms and TNF-α-stimulated MH7A cells while inhibiting ZFAS1 was demonstrated 
to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis of MH7A cells. Furthermore, 
ZFAS1 knockdown exerted anti-inflammation effect in vitro and in vivo and 
reduced the arthritis index value. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation and 
dual-luciferase reporter assays identified the binding of ZFAS1 to microRNA 
(miR)-296-5p as well as the binding of miR-296-5p to matrix metalloproteinase-15 
(MMP-15). Of note, ZFAS1 could bind miR-296-5p to up-regulate the expression of 
MMP-15. Our results from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated silencing 
ZFAS1 mitigated RA-like symptoms such as inflammation and hyperplasia via 
miR-296-5p-dependent inhibition of MMP-15. Taken altogether, our study confirmed 
that ZFAS1 involved in RA progression by competitively binding to miR-296-5p and 
regulating MMP-15 expression.

The aim of the article was to study the mechanism of Lipoxin A4 (LXA4)-mediated 
p38 MAPK pathway protecting mice against collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The 
impact of LXA4 (0, 5, 10, 15 nM) on synoviocytes proliferation of CIA mice was 
detected using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 
(MTT) assay. CIA mice were treated with LXA4, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor), and/or 
anisomycin (a p38 agonist), and the arthritis severity score in each mouse was 
determined. The gene or protein expressions were detected with Western Blotting, 
ELISA, or qRT-PCR. LXA4 inhibited the synoviocytes proliferation of CIA mice 
with decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ and reduced p-p38/total 
p38 expression in synoviocytes in a dose-dependent manner. LXA4 levels were 
decreased in synovial tissues and plasma of CIA mice, but p-p38/total p38 
expression was increased in synovial tissues. LXA4 could downregulate 
p-p38/total p38 expression in synovial tissues of CIA mice. Both LXA4 and 
SB203580 reduced arthritis severity score of CIA mice with the reduction of 
synovial tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration. CIA mice treated 
with LXA4 and SB203580 had lower levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, 
accompanying decreased MDA as well as increased SOD, CAT,and GPx. However, 
anisomycin could reverse the protect effects of LXA4 on CIA mice regarding the 
abovementioned inflammatory factors and oxidative stress indexes. LXA4 protected 
mice against collagen-induced arthritis via inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling 
pathway, which may be a potential new therapeutic target for rheumatoid 
arthritis.

Tofacitinib, a janus kinase inhibitor, is a novel immunosuppressive drug for 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Septic arthritis (SA) and sepsis caused 
by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), for which RA patients are at risk, are 
infections with high mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
effect of tofacitinib on S. aureus infections using mouse models. In vitro 
tofacitinib treated mouse splenocytes were stimulated with S. aureus derived 
stimuli. Mice pre-treated with tofacitinib were inoculated intravenously with 
either arthritogenic- or septic doses of S. aureus. Arthritis severity and 
mortality were compared between groups. Additionally, pre-treated mice were 
challenged with staphylococcal toxin TSST-1 to induce shock. Tofacitinib 
inhibited splenocyte proliferation and IFN-γ production in response to TSST-1 
and dead S. aureus. In SA, tofacitinib treatment aggravated arthritis with more 
severe bone erosions. However, in sepsis, treated mice displayed significantly 
prolonged survival compared to controls. Similarly, in staphylococcal 
enterotoxin-induced shock tofacitinib pre-treatment, but not late treatment 
dramatically reduced mortality, which was accompanied by decreased levels of 
TNF-α and IFN-γ. Our findings show that tofacitinib treatment increase 
susceptibility of SA in mice, but has a positive effect on survival in S. 
aureus-induced sepsis and a strong protective effect in toxin-induced shock.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
synovial inflammation and structural destruction of the joints. Bone damage 
occurs in an early stage after onset and osteoclast activation plays a 
substantial role in its progression. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor 
(CSF1R) is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase specifically expressed in 
monocytic-lineage cells such as macrophages and osteoclasts. Here, we 
investigated the effect of JTE-952, a novel CSF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on 
osteoclast formation in vitro and on bone destruction in a mouse model of 
collagen-induced arthritis. JTE-952 completely inhibited osteoclast 
differentiation from human monocytes, with an IC50 of 2.8 nmol/L, and reduced 
osteoclast formation from the synovial cells of RA patients. Detectable levels 
of colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), a ligand of CSF1R, were observed in the 
synovial tissues of the arthritis model, similar to those observed in the 
pathology of human RA. JTE-952 significantly suppressed increases in the bone 
destruction score, the number of tartrate-resistant-acid-phosphatase-positive 
cells, and the severity of arthritis in the model mice. We also examined the 
efficacy of JTE-952 combined with methotrexate. This combination therapy more 
effectively reduced the severity of bone destruction and arthritis than 
monotherapy with either agent alone. In summary, JTE-952 potently inhibited 
human osteoclast formation in vitro and suppressed bone destruction in an 
experimental arthritis model, especially when combined with methotrexate. These 
results indicate that JTE-952 should strongly inhibit bone destruction and joint 
inflammation in RA patients and effectively prevent the progression of the 
structural destruction of joints.

Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is approved for the 
treatment of different human inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis and cytokine release syndrome. Tocilizumab binds to the interleukin-6 
receptor (IL-6R) and thereby blocks signaling of the pro-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-6. Initial studies and all authority assessment reports state that 
tocilizumab is effective in humans, but cannot bind to the murine or rat IL-6R 
and thus not block IL-6 signaling in the mouse. However, several recent studies 
described the use of tocilizumab in mice and reported biological effects that 
were attributed to IL-6 blockade. In this study, we investigate the capability 
of tocilizumab to block IL-6 signaling using different human and murine cell 
lines. Our results unequivocally confirm the original state of the art that 
tocilizumab blocks signaling via the human IL-6R, but does not block IL-6 
signaling in murine cells.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is one of the most commonly prescribed 
immune-suppressants in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our previous research 
showed that HCQ suppressed RA development by inhibiting T follicular helper 
(Tfh) cells directly. Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as the link between innate and 
acquired immunity. Whether HCQ suppressed Tfh cell through DCs was not clear. In 
current study, we found that HCQ efficiently inhibited CD86, chemokine (C-X-C 
motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression and interferon-α (IFN-α) secretion of 
healthy donor derived purified DCs stimulated by RA patient serum. To mimic RA, 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used and treated with HCQ daily 
for fifty-four days prior to sacrifice. We found HCQ inhibited DC maturation and 
migration to lymph nodes (LNs), manifested as down-regulated expression of CD40, 
CD80, CD86, MHCII (I-Aq) on LN DCs. In addition, HCQ reduced the level of 
chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and L-selectin on peripheral blood DCs and 
diminished percentage of LN DCs. Of note, HCQ only inhibited CpG ODN 
1826-induced IL-12 secretion by bone marrow DCs (BMDCs) stimulated by various 
toll like receptor (TLR) agonists. Mechanistically, HCQ down-regulated the 
expression of TLR9 not only in healthy donor PBMC-derived DCs stimulated by RA 
patient serum, but also in LN DCs of CIA mice and CpG-activated BMDCs. 
Furthermore, arthritis scores in TLR9-/- mice were much lower than that in wild 
type mice with impaired maturity and migration capability of DCs. Collectively, 
activation of DCs contributes to the pathogenesis of RA and HCQ shows protective 
effects on RA by inhibition of DC activation via blocking TLR9.

Previous studies have suggested that the inflammatory response contributes to 
the onset of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Interleukin (IL)-38, a 
newly discovered cytokine of the IL-1 family, has been demonstrated to play an 
anti-inflammatory role in autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. However, whether IL-38 participates in the 
pathogenesis of IVDD remains unknown. In this study, human disc tissues from 
IVDD patients and rat disc tissues from an IVDD model were collected to measure 
the expression of IL-38 in the IVDD groups and the control groups by western 
blot and immunohistochemical staining. To further determine the role of IL-38 in 
IVDD, human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPCs) were stimulated with TNF-α to 
generate an in vitro model of inflammation to mimic the local inflammatory 
environment of the lumbar disc. The inflammatory response and HNPC degeneration 
markers were measured after stimulation with TNF-α and IL-38. IL-38 was 
upregulated in both the human and rat degenerated disc tissues compared with the 
control tissues. In vitro, IL-38 significantly decreased the TNF-α-induced 
expression of IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 in the HNPCs, and IL-38 
also alleviated the TNF-α-induced reductions in type II collagen and aggrecan. 
Moreover, IL-38 inhibited the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the 
HNPC-based model of inflammation by reducing the expression level of the NF-κB 
P-P65 protein. In conclusion, IL-38 could alleviate the inflammatory response 
and HNPC degeneration in vitro via the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling 
pathway. These results suggest that IL-38 may be a new strategy for the 
treatment of IVDD.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated proteins contribute to the 
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through affecting synoviocyte 
proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production. The role of DERL3, an 
ER-associated degradation component, in joint inflammation of RA was explored. 
Synovial tissues from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients were collected, and in 
RA synovial tissue, DERL3 showed up-regulation and significantly positive 
correlation with the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), 
interleukin (IL)-6 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. Immunofluorescence 
result suggested DERL3 was located in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Among 
different inflammatory stimuli, DERL3 could be up-regulated by TNF-α stimulation 
in FLS. Under TNF-α stimulation, knocking down DERL3, the expression of IL-6, 
IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-13 was reduced and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-κB) signaling pathway was inhibited. In pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) rat 
model, Derl3 was up-regulated in synovial tissue and disease was attenuated 
after intraarticular injection of siDerl3. Overall, we conclude that TNF-α 
inducing DERL3 expression promotes the inflammation of FLS through activation of 
NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting DERL3 plays important roles in the 
pathogenesis of RA and is a promising therapeutic target.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory disease, which 
currently lacks effective treatment. Here, we discovered that the Regulator of G 
Protein Signaling 12 (RGS12) plays a key role in regulating inflammation. 
Transcriptional and protein analysis revealed that RGS12 was upregulated in 
human and mouse RA macrophages. Deletion of RGS12 in myeloid lineage or globally 
inhibits the development of collagen-induced arthritis including joint swelling 
and bone destruction. Mechanistically, RGS12 associates with NF-κB(p65) to 
activate its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation through PTB domain, and 
NF-κB(p65) regulates RGS12 expression in a transcriptional manner. The nuclear 
translocation ability of NF-κB(p65) and RGS12 can both be enhanced by 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). Furthermore, ablation of RGS12 via RNA interference 
significantly blocks the inflammatory process in vivo and in vitro. These 
results demonstrate that RGS12 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory arthritis.

BACKGROUND: The present work aimed to develop an ethosomal gel of naproxen 
sodium for the amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis.
OBJECTIVE: In the present work, we have explored the potential of ethosomes to 
deliver naproxen into deeper skin strata. Further, the anti-inflammatory 
efficacy of naproxen ethosomal formulation was assessed using the 
carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model.
METHODS: Naproxen sodium nanoethosomes were prepared using different proportions 
of lipoid S100 (50mg-200mg), ethanol (20-50%) and water, and were further 
characterized on the basis of vesicle morphology, entrapment efficiency, zeta 
potential, in-vitro drug release and ex-vivo permeation studies.
RESULTS: The optimized ethosomal formulation was found to have 129 ± 0.01 nm 
particle size, 0.295 Polydispersity Index (PDI), -3.29 mV zeta potential, 88% 
entrapment efficiency and 96.573% drug release in 24 hours. TEM and SEM analysis 
of the optimized formulation showed slightly smooth spherical structures. The 
Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that ethosomes could easily infiltrate 
into deeper dermal layers (upto 104.9μm) whereas the hydroalcoholic solution of 
the drug could penetrate up to 74.9μm. Further, the optimized ethosomal 
formulation was incorporated into 1% carbopol 934 gel base and optimized wherein 
the transdermal flux was found to be approximately 10 times more than the 
hydroethanolic solution. Also, the in-vivo pharmacodynamic study of the 
optimized ethosomal gel exhibited a higher percentage inhibition of swelling paw 
edema than marketed diclofenac gel.
CONCLUSION: The ethosomal gel was successfully developed and has shown the 
potential to be a good option for the replacement of conventional therapies of 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Autoimmune-mediated dry eye disease is a pathological feature of multiple 
disorders including Sjögren's syndrome, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis that has 
a life-long, detrimental impact on vision and overall quality of life. Although 
late stage disease outcomes such as epithelial barrier dysfunction, reduced 
corneal innervation and chronic inflammation have been well characterized in 
both human patients and mouse models, there is little to no understanding of 
early pathological processes. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the loss of 
cornea homeostasis and disease progression are unknown. Here, we utilize the 
autoimmune regulatory (Aire)-deficient mouse model of autoimmune-mediated dry 
eye disease in combination with genome wide transcriptomics, high-resolution 
imaging and atomic force microscopy to reveal a potential extracellular matrix 
(ECM)-biomechanical-based mechanism driving cellular and morphological changes 
at early disease onset. Early disease in the Aire-deficient mouse model is 
associated with a mild reduction in tear production and moderate immune cell 
infiltration, allowing for interrogation of cellular, molecular and 
biomechanical changes largely independent of chronic inflammation. Using these 
tools, we demonstrate for the first time that the emergence of 
autoimmune-mediated dry eye disease is associated with an alteration in the 
biomechanical properties of the cornea. We reveal a dramatic disruption of the 
synthesis and organization of the extracellular matrix as well as degradation of 
the epithelial basement membrane during early disease. Notably, we provide 
evidence that the nerve supply to the cornea is severely reduced at early 
disease stages and that this is independent of basement membrane destruction or 
significant immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, diseased corneas display 
spatial heterogeneity in mechanical, structural and compositional changes, with 
the limbal compartment often exhibiting the opposite response compared to the 
central cornea. Despite these differences, however, epithelial hyperplasia is 
apparent in both compartments, possibly driven by increased activation of IL-1R1 
and YAP signaling pathways. Thus, we reveal novel perturbations in corneal 
biomechanics, matrix organization and cell behavior during the early phase of 
dry eye that may underlie disease development and progression, presenting new 
potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Betulinic acid (BA) inhibits the migration, invasion, and cytoskeletal 
reorganization of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis. Here, to further explore the mechanism of action of BA in 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, we investigated the pharmacodynamic 
effects of BA on synovial inflammation in a rat model of type II CIA. After 
inducing hind paw swelling, the rats were divided into four groups: healthy 
controls (normal), and rats that underwent CIA and received methotrexate 
treatment (MTX), BA treatment (BA), or no treatment (CIA). Body weight and hind 
paw swelling were determined regularly, and arthritis scores were calculated 
weekly. On day 35, rats were sacrificed and their hind ankle joints sectioned 
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological evaluation. BA 
significantly reduced CIA-induced hind paw swelling, synovial tissue 
proliferation, cartilage destruction, and vasospasm. BA treatment also decreased 
serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels 
in rats with CIA. The CCK-8 assay was used to detect the proliferation of 
isolated vimentin+CD68- RA-FLS; RA-FLS were stimulated with TNF-α in vitro. BA 
significantly inhibited TNF-α-stimulated RA-FLS proliferation, as well as IL-1β 
and IL-6 secretion. BA also downregulated the transcription of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and 
decreased the expression of the NF-кB pathway proteins (NF-kB-P65, IkBα, and 
IKKα/β) in the TNF-α-stimulated RA-FLS. These results indicate that BA 
alleviated the symptoms of CIA by inhibiting synoviocyte proliferation, 
modifying TNF-α- and NF-кB-related inflammatory pathways, and downregulating 
inflammatory mediators and growth factors including IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, and 
TGF-β.

PURPOSE: We aimed to use 68Ga-citrate, a labeled product of gallium (iron 
analog), combined with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) 
to non-invasively evaluate the potential of the iron-responsive product 
dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
PROCEDURES: From the establishment of chicken II collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) rat model over 40 days, 20 rats with one-to-one corresponding arthritis 
index (AI) scores were randomly divided into two groups. One group received oral 
DHA (at a dose of 1.5 ml/(kg day), containing 20 mg DHA per 1 ml) for 15 days; 
the other group received stroke-physiological saline solution (SSS, 
1.5 ml/(kg day) for 15 days. 68Ga-citrate micro-PET/CT imaging was performed on 
day 0 (D0), day 5 (D5), day 10 (D10), and day 15 (D15) of oral administration. 
After data reconstruction, the cross-sectional length "d" of the ankle joint of 
each rat was measured on the transverse CT, and the SUVmax of the ankle joint 
and muscle background was measured for statistical analysis. After micro-PET/CT 
collection, the ankle joint tissue was observed by HE staining.
RESULTS: The ankle joint swelling in the DHA group was significantly suppressed, 
but the SSS group showed no significant suppression. 68Ga-citrate micro-PET/CT 
imaging results and microscope observation confirmed this finding. Statistical 
analysis indicated that the time tendency of AI score (Binteraction = 0.495, 
P < 0.001) and T/NT (Binteraction = 1.345, P < 0.001) were discrepant between 
DHA and SSS groups. The AI score and T/NT of the DHA group gradually increased 
with time, while the SSS group score gradually decreased. Furthermore, the 
Spearman correlation coefficient was used to describe the relationship between 
"d" and T/NT, which was positively correlated (r = 0.855, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of the 
iron-responsive product DHA in arthritis can be monitored by an iron-like 
radioactive tracer (68Ga-citrate).

The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effect of Ganoderic acid A 
(GAA) on adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. In this study, the rat model of 
collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis (CIA) was established with type II 
collagen plus Freund's complete adjuvant. Arthritis index, joint pathology, toe 
swelling, hemorheology, synovial cell apoptosis, related cytokines and 
JAK3/STAT3 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway were measured in 
rats. We found that GAA can significantly inhibit the arthritis index, improve 
joint pathology, reduce toe swelling, improve blood rheology, improve synovial 
cell apoptosis, and restore related cytokine negative regulation JAK3/STAT3 and 
NF-κB signaling pathways. In conclusion, GAA has an obvious therapeutic effect 
on joint inflammation of toes in CIA model rats, which may be due to the 
regulation of JAK3/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathway.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that 
do not typically code for a protein. lncRNAs have regulatory roles in many 
physiological processes, and their dysregulation can contribute to cancer, 
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the onset of 
autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid 
arthritis. However, lncRNA expression changes in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a 
form of inflammation induced by immunological tolerance disorders, are poorly 
understood. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we used microarrays to 
profile 1161 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs; 608 up- and 553 
down-regulated) and 11 512 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs; 5189 up- and 
6323 down- regulated) in a concanavalin A-induced AIH mouse model. We used 
quantitative real-time PCR to confirm the expression of eight DELs and DEMs, and 
analyzed the coexpression relationship between them. Potential biological 
functions of screened DELs and DEMs were predicted with Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. DEL-DEM interaction networks were 
also constructed. Our study revealed the roles of DELs and DEMs in the 
pathogenesis of AIH. We also provided potential candidate biomarkers that may 
have potential for future development into possible diagnostics or as a 
treatment for this disorder.

The encapsulation of Glucocorticoids (GCs) into long-circulating liposomes 
(LCLs) is a proven strategy to reduce the side effects of glucocorticoids and 
improve the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). With the aim of supporting the development of GC-loaded LCLs, and 
potentially predict patient response to therapy clinically, we evaluated a 
direct PET imaging radiolabelling approach for preformed GC-LCLs in an animal 
model of human inflammatory arthritis. Methods: A preformed PEGylated liposomal 
methylprednisolone hemisuccinate (NSSL-MPS) nanomedicine was radiolabelled using 
[89Zr]Zr(oxinate)4 (89Zr-oxine), characterised and tracked in vivo using PET 
imaging in a K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis (STA) mouse model of inflammatory 
arthritis and non-inflamed controls. Histology and joint size measurements were 
used to confirm inflammation. The biodistribution of 89Zr-NSSL-MPS was compared 
to that of free 89Zr in the same model. A therapeutic study using NSSL-MPS using 
the same time points as the PET/CT imaging was carried out. Results: The 
radiolabelling efficiency of NSSL-MPS with [89Zr]Zr(oxinate)4 was 69 ± 8 %. 
PET/CT imaging of 89Zr-NSSL-MPS showed high uptake (3.6 ± 1.5 % ID; 17.4 ± 9.3 % 
ID/mL) at inflamed joints, with low activity present in non-inflamed joints (0.5 
± 0.1 % ID; 2.7 ± 1.1 % ID/mL). Importantly, a clear correlation between joint 
swelling and high 89Zr-NSSL-MPS uptake was observed, which was not observed with 
free 89Zr. STA mice receiving a therapeutic dose of NSSL-MPS showed a reduction 
in inflammation at the time points used for the PET/CT imaging compared with the 
control group. Conclusions: PET imaging was used for the first time to track a 
liposomal glucocorticoid, showing high uptake at visible and occult inflamed 
sites and a good correlation with the degree of inflammation. A subsequent 
therapeutic response matching imaging time points in the same model demonstrated 
the potential of this radiolabeling method as a theranostic tool for the 
prediction of therapeutic response - with NSSL-MPS and similar nanomedicines - 
in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Secondary osteoporosis can also be caused by chronic inflammatory skin disease 
as well as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. However, the 
exact role of osteoporosis in inflammatory skin conditions has not been 
elucidated. Using a mouse model of dermatitis, we investigated the 
pathophysiology of osteoporosis in inflammatory skin conditions and the 
therapeutic impact of osteoporosis medication on inflammatory skin disease. We 
employed model mice of spontaneous skin inflammation, specifically 
overexpressing human caspase-1 in the epidermis. Bone density and the expression 
of various mRNAs in the femur were examined by micro CT and RT-PCR. The effects 
of minodronate and anti-RANKL antibody on bone structure, histology, and femur 
blood flow were studied. The mouse model of skin inflammation showed a marked 
decrease in bone density compared to wild-type littermates with abnormalities in 
both bone resorption and formation. Minodronate improved bone density by 
decreasing osteoclasts, but anti-RANKL antibody did not improve. In the 
dermatitis model, the blood flow in the bone marrow was decreased, and 
minodronate restored this parameter. A model of persistent dermatitis exhibited 
marked osteoporosis, but the impact of chronic dermatitis on osteoporosis has 
not been thoroughly investigated. We should explore the pathogenesis of 
osteoporosis in skin inflammatory diseases.

Intra-articular (IA) injection of thermoresponsive hydrogels coupled with 
microparticles (MPs) possess the benefit of sustaining the anti-inflammatory 
drug effect within the joint cavity for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. 
Star-shaped thermoresponsive poly(polyethylene glycol) methacrylate 
[Poly(PEGMA)] copolymers were synthesized using free radical polymerization 
technique and fully characterized. Triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-loaded 
PLA/mPEG-PDL MPs, previously optimized, were integrated into the synthesized 
copolymer solutions at various concentrations and tested for their gelation 
temperatures. The MPs-in-hydrogel formulations were characterized using scanning 
electron microscope (SEM), viscosity measurements, ex vivo bioadhesion, and in 
vitro release studies. The anti-inflammatory effect of integrated systems was 
assessed in adjuvant-induced monoarthritic rat knee joints and compared to 
Kenacort and TA-loaded MPs. Two copolymers were successfully synthesized; G-1 = 
poly(PEGMA188-ME-co-PEGMA475-ME) and G-2 = poly(PEGMA246-EE-co-PEGMA475-ME). 
Using the tube inversion technique, the gel formation was found dependent on 
copolymer concentration. An irreversible aggregation was obtained at copolymer 
concentrations ≤10% (w/v), while a gel was formed at 20 and 30% (w/v) of both 
copolymers upon increasing temperature. The MP-hydrogel formulations were 
optimized at 20 and 30% (w/v) of G-1 and G-2 with gelation temperatures of 33 
and 37 °C, respectively. SEM images revealed the porous microstructures of 
hydrogels and their adsorption on MP surfaces. The integrated formulas showed 
pseudoplastic behaviors, while the bioadhesion study confirmed their 
bioadhesiveness on excised cartilage. The in vitro release study confirmed drug 
sustainment from MPs-hydrogels compared to MPs. In vivo studies proved the 
superiority of MP-in-hydrogels in treatment of induced arthritis, relative to 
Kenacort and MPs alone, suggesting the applicability of this integrated platform 
in IA drug delivery.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that the etiology and pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are closely associated with estrogen metabolism and 
deficiency. Estrogen protects against articular damage. Estradiol replacement 
therapy ameliorates local inflammation and knee joint swelling in ovariectomized 
models of RA. The mechanistic basis for the protective role of 17β-estradiol 
(17β-E2) is poorly understood. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), a 
sodium-permeable channel, plays a pivotal role in acid-induced articular 
chondrocyte injury. The aims of this study were to evaluate the role of 17β-E2 
in acid-induced chondrocyte injury and to determine the effect of 17β-E2 on the 
level and activity of ASIC1a protein. Results showed that pretreatment with 
17β-E2 attenuated acid-induced damage, suppressed apoptosis, and restored 
mitochondrial function. Further, 17β-E2 was shown to reduce protein levels of 
ASIC1a through the ERα receptor, to protect chondrocytes from acid-induced 
apoptosis, and to induce ASIC1a protein degradation through the 
autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Taken together, these results show that the use of 
17β-E2 may be a novel strategy for the treatment of RA by reducing cartilage 
destruction through down-regulation of ASIC1a protein levels.

PURPOSE: To overcome negative adverse effects and improve therapeutic index of 
dexamethasone (Dex) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we developed a novel sustained 
release formulation-intra-articular injectable dexamethasone-loaded 
thermosensitive hydrogel (DLTH) with chitosan-glycerin-borax as carrier for the 
remission of inflammation and pain. The focus of this article is to explore both 
anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects of DLTH joint injection in bovine 
type-II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats.
METHODS: Wistar rats were randomized into three groups, including the normal 
group (n=6), the model group (n=6) and the DLTH group (n=10). Joint injection of 
DLTH (1mg/kg Dex per rat) was injected on day 12 in the DLTH group twice a week 
for three weeks. Clinical signs of body weight, paw swelling and arthritis 
scores, histologic analysis, hind paw mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), 
plantar pressure pain threshold (PPT) were taken into consideration. Serum 
contents of IL-17A, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin 2 (PGI2) and 
prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 
inflammatory factors and pain-related mediators in synovium and dorsal root 
ganglia (DRG), Western blotting of NF-κB in synovium were all evaluated.
RESULTS: Paw swelling, arthritis scores and joint inflammation destruction were 
all attenuated in the DLTH-treated group. Results showed that DLTH not only 
down-regulated serum IL-17A, but also mRNA levels of inflammatory factors and 
NGF, and key proteins contents of the NF-κB pathway in synovium. Increases of 
MWT and PPT in DLTH-treated rats elucidated pain-reducing effects of DLTH. 
Elevated serum PGD2 levels and declines of serum PGE2 and PGI2, and inflammatory 
and pain-related genes in DRGs in the DLTH group were also recorded.
CONCLUSION: These data elucidated that DLTH joint injection impeded synovial 
inflammation processes through down-regulating transcription activity of NF-κB 
pathway, and intra-articular DLTH may aid in the regulation of RA pain through 
regulating inflammation and pain conduction process.

The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to the inhibition of 
osteoblast differentiation. Exosomes secreted from RA fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (RA-FLSs-exos) are associated with the pathogenesis of RA and 
microRNAs (miRNAs) being crucial for RA progression. Accordingly, the aim of the 
present study is to elucidate the effect of RA-FLS-derived exosomes on 
osteoblast differentiation and further identify exosomal cargos responsible for 
this effect. RA-FLSs were isolated from a RA patient and osteoblasts from the 
donor bone. Isolated RA-FLSs-exos were co-cultured with osteoblasts. Osteoblast 
differentiation was evaluated by ALP quantification assays, Alizarin Red S 
staining, and determining markers of osteoblast activity (Osx, OC, Col1a1 and 
Dlx2). Collagen induced arthritis (CIA)-induced mouse models were established. 
RA-FLSs-exo could be phagocytosed by osteoblasts. Elevating the expression of 
miR-486-5p in RA-FLSs-exo promoted osteoblast differentiation. miR-486-5p 
targeted Tob1 and activated the BMP/Smad signaling pathway in osteoblasts. In 
addition, RA-FLSs-exo containing miR-486-5p facilitated osteoblast 
differentiation by activating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway and repressing 
Tob1. Moreover, RA-FLSs-exo containing miR-486-5p alleviated the disease 
severity of RA by decreasing Tob1 expression in CIA-induced mice. To sum up, 
RA-FLSs-exo carrying miR-486-5p serve as a promoter for osteoblast 
differentiation in RA, ultimately highlighting a promising competitive new 
target for RA treatment.

In human autoimmune diseases, low plasma levels of complement factors C3 and C4 
are commonly used as a proxy for complement activation. The measurements of C3 
and C4 concentrations (the result of synthesis and consumption) however, show 
low sensitivity in patient follow-up. We find that the estimation of the C3dg 
fragment released during complement activation is a better parameter for 
complement activation. Available techniques for measuring the activation 
fragment C3dg, e.g. immune-electrophoresis or involving PEG-precipitation, are 
time-consuming and difficult to standardize. Here we examine the specificity and 
use of an antibody with mono-specificity for a neoepitope at the N-terminus of 
C3dg, which is only exposed after cleavage of C3. We present a stable, 
reproducible, and easy-to-use, time-resolved immunoassay with specificity for 
C3dg that can be used to directly evaluate ongoing complement activation. We 
demonstrate that the assay can be applied to clinical samples with a high 
specificity (95%) and a positive likelihood ratio of 10. It can also 
differentiate the complement related disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus from 
controls and other immune-mediatedimmune mediated diseases like Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (86% specificity) and Spondyloarthritis (91% specificity). Further, we 
establish how the assay may also be used for experimental research in in vivo 
mouse models.

Interleukin 26 (IL-26) is a new member of the IL-10 family that is highly 
expressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the functions of IL-26 produced 
by macrophages in RA have not been elucidated. In the present work, we evaluated 
the effects and the mechanisms of IL-26 on M1 and M2 macrophage differentiation. 
Human or mouse macrophage cells were treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), 
interferon gamma (IFNγ), or IL-4 alone or concurrently treated with IL-26 to 
monitor M1 or M2 macrophage subtypes. The expression level of M1 or M2 
macrophage genes was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The molecular 
mechanisms of downstream signaling activation during differentiation were 
investigated by immunoblotting assay. Our results found that IL-26 promoted 
macrophage cells from CD80+ M1 macrophage differentiation, not from the CD206+ 
M2 phenotype. The messenger RNA of M1-type macrophage markers tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was up-regulated 
in the IL-26-treated group. Also, the M1-related proinflammatory cytokines TNFα 
and IL-6 were induced after IL-26 stimulation. Interestingly, IL-10, a cytokine 
marker of M2 macrophage, was also elevated after IL-26 stimulation. Moreover, 
the M1-like macrophage stimulated by IL-26 underwent cJUN, nuclear factor kappa 
B (NF-κB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 
activation. Our findings suggested the role of IL-26 in synovial macrophages of 
active rheumatoid arthritis and provided a new insight into IL-26 as a candidate 
therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is associated 
with systemic inflammation and results in the destruction of joints and 
cartilage. The pathogenesis of RA involves a complex inflammatory process 
resulting from the action of various proinflammatory cytokines and, therefore, 
many novel therapeutic agents to block cytokines or cytokine-mediated signaling 
have been developed. Here, we tested the preventive effects of a small peptide, 
AESIS-1, in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with the aim of 
identifying a novel safe and effective biological for treating RA. This novel 
peptide significantly suppressed the induction and development of CIA, resulting 
in the suppression of synovial inflammation and cartilage degradation in vivo. 
Moreover, AESIS-1 regulated JAK/STAT3-mediated gene expression in vitro. In 
particular, the gene with the most significant change in expression was 
suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), which was enhanced 8-fold. 
Expression of the STAT3-specific inhibitor, Socs3, was obviously enhanced 
dose-dependently by AESIS-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in a 
significant reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation in splenocytes from severe CIA 
mice. This indicated that AESIS-1 regulated STAT3 activity by upregulation of 
SOCS3 expression. Furthermore, IL-17 expression and the frequency of Th17 cells 
were considerably decreased by AESIS-1 in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our 
data suggest that the novel synthetic peptide AESIS-1 could be an effective 
therapeutic for treating RA via the downregulation of STAT3 signaling.

The immunoglobulin-like domain containing receptor 2 (ILDR2), a type I 
transmembrane protein belonging to the B7 family of immunomodulatory receptors, 
has been described to induce an immunosuppressive effect on T-cell responses. 
Besides its expression in several nonlymphoid tissue types, we found that ILDR2 
was also expressed in fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) in the stromal part of 
the lymph node. These immunoregulatory cells were located in the T-cell zone and 
were essential for the recruitment of naïve T cells and activated dendritic 
cells to the lymph nodes. Previously, it has been shown that an ILDR2-Fc fusion 
protein exhibits immunomodulatory effects in several models of autoimmune 
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type I diabetes. 
Herein, we report the generation and characterization of a human/mouse/monkey 
cross-reactive anti-ILDR2 hIgG2 antibody, BAY 1905254, developed to block the 
immunosuppressive activity of ILDR2 for cancer immunotherapy. BAY 1905254 was 
shown to promote T-cell activation in vitro and enhance antigen-specific T-cell 
proliferation and cytotoxicity in vivo in mice. BAY 1905254 also showed potent 
efficacy in various syngeneic mouse cancer models, and the efficacy was found to 
correlate with increasing mutational load in the cancer models used. Additive or 
even synergistic antitumor effects were observed when BAY 1905254 was 
administered in combination with anti-PD-L1, an immunogenic cell death-inducing 
chemotherapeutic, or with tumor antigen immunization. Taken together, our data 
showed that BAY 1905254 is a potential drug candidate for cancer immunotherapy, 
supporting its further evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, systemic disease mainly 
affecting joints. Presently, there is no specific treatment/ drug available for 
curing RA except few supportive medicines. Therefore, the focus has been shifted 
to medicinal plants for the treatment of such diseases. Choerospondias axillaris 
commonly known as Lupsi/Lapsi and has been reported to have several properties 
for the treatment of various diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The present study has been conducted to explore the anti-inflammatory 
effects of Choerospondias axillaris fruit extract on Synoviocytes (FLS) and 
Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat model.
METHODS: Methanolic extract of the Choerospondias axillaris fruit was used for 
determining phytochemical, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Antioxidant activity of Choerospondias axillaris fruit was determined by free 
radicals scavenging assays and bioactive compounds were identified via LC-MS/MS 
analysis. Anti-inflammatory effect was investigated in RA and Osteo Arthritis 
(OA) primary cells and also in Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat models. 
Further, the medicinal properties of anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds were 
supported by docking studies.
RESULTS: In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed significant decrease in the levels 
of inflammatory cytokines. Docking analysis revealed that quercetin inhibits 
TNF-α having -9.1 kcal/mol binding energy and 10.13 μM inhibitory constant. 
Quercetin also inhibits IL-6 having -6.6 kcal/mol binding energy and 21.9 μM 
inhibitory constant.
CONCLUSION: Observed results suggest that the underutilized fruit Choerospondias 
axillaris can be used to reduce the inflammation of inflammatory diseases like 
RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, is a primary 
cause of disability worldwide. The involvement of fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLSs) in the regulation of the pathogenesis of RA has been highlighted. 
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important candidates for cell-based treatment 
in many inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Herein, we identify whether 
MSC-derived exosomes loaded with microRNA-320a (miR-320a) regulate RA-FLSs. 
Synovial tissues from 22 patients with RA and 9 patients with osteoarthritis 
were collected. RA-FLSs were obtained from patients with RA, and their functions 
were evaluated by determining levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and IL-8 
and by transwell migration and invasion assays. Dual luciferase reporter gene 
assays were employed to identify interaction between miR-320a and CXC chemokine 
ligand 9 (CXCL9). A co-culture system of MSC-derived exosomes and RA-FLSs were 
performed. The collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse models with arthritis and 
bone damage were developed. Our results revealed the existence of reciprocal 
expression of miR-320a and CXCL9 in the synovial tissues obtained from patients 
with RA. CXCL9 knockdown or miR-320a upregulation suppressed the activation, 
migration, and invasion of RA-FLSs. CXCL9 was confirmed to be a target of 
miR-320a, and CXCL9 overexpression restored RA-FLS function in the presence of 
miR-320a. MSC-derived exosomes containing miR-320a mimic significantly 
suppressed RA-FLS activation, migration, and invasion in vitro and attenuated 
arthritis and bone damage in mice with CIA in vivo. Our study uncovers that 
MSC-derived exosomes participate in the intercellular transfer of miR-320a and 
subsequently inhibit the progression of RA. These results provide a novel 
potential therapeutic approach for RA treatment by increasing miR-320a in 
exosomes.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease of the joints, which causes 
severe pain and excessive systemic circulation of harmful inflammatory 
cytokines. Current treatments are limited, with some patients not responding 
well, and some experiencing severe and detrimental side effects. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSC) are cell-based therapeutics being evaluated as potent 
immunomodulators in RA and may provide relief to patients not responding well to 
drug-based treatments. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of BX-U001 human 
umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) to treat RA, in 
support of a successful investigational new drug application. A collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model of RA was established in DBA/1 J mice. Mice from the 
treatment assessment group were given a tail vein infusion of hUC-MSC 24 days 
after primary RA induction, while control assessment (CA) group mice were given 
cell-free carrier solution. All animals were evaluated daily for RA symptoms via 
clinical scoring, blood was taken periodically for cytokine analysis, and mice 
were dissected at end point for histological analysis. A linear mixed model was 
used to compare the rate of change among groups. The clinical scores of TA group 
were significantly reduced compared with CA group (P < 0.01), indicating 
therapeutic effects. The histological scores of the joints in TA group were 
significantly lower than those in the CA group (P < 0.05), but had no 
significant difference compared with Healthy groups (P > 0.05). The 
concentration of (interleukin) IL-6 in TA group was significantly reduced by 
80.0% (P < 0.0001) 2 days after treatment and by 93.4% at the experimental 
endpoint compared with levels prior to hUC-MSC injection. A single intravenous 
infusion of hUC-MSC (2 × 106 cells/mouse), to CIA-induced DBA/1 J mice, resulted 
in significant alleviation of RA symptoms and may provide significant 
therapeutic benefits in humans.

Atractylodes Rhizoma is one of two principal components in Ermiaosan, a 
well-known traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Atractylodes oil (AO) represents a potential alternative 
treatment for RA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of AO 
in rats with Adjuvant Arthritis (AA) by exploration of changes in serum 
metabolites using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Foot thickness 
and arthritis score, ankle joint pathological structure, the concentrations of 
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and the expression of MMPs in ankle joint tissue were 
measured as indicators of efficacy of treatment using AO. In addition, 
multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify differential production 
of metabolites and biomarkers, and to analyze metabolic pathways. The results 
demonstrate that administration of AO resulted in a good therapeutic effect in 
the AA rat model, with significantly improved joint swelling, reduced joint 
score, and inhibition of inflammation, synovial pannus hyperplasia, and bone and 
cartilage destruction. Furthermore, AO was found to exert its effect against 
rheumatoid arthritis principally by differentially affecting 11 metabolites and 
six metabolic pathways, predominantly related to abnormal amino acid metabolism, 
in addition to energy-related metabolic pathways. This study evaluated the 
capability of AO to effectively treat AA rats, providing a novel strategy for 
the treatment of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to joint destruction and deformity, which is 
a significant cause of the loss of the young and middle-aged labor force. 
However, the treatment of RA is still filled with challenges. Though 
dexamethasone, one of the glucocorticoids, is commonly used in the treatment of 
RA, its clinical use is limited because of the required high-dose and long-term 
use, unsatisfactory therapeutic effects, and various side-effects. 
Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) can augment the ultrasonic 
cavitation effects and trigger drug release from targeted nanocarriers in the 
synovial cavity, which makes it a more effective synergistic treatment strategy 
for RA. In this work, we aim to utilize the UTMD effect to augment the 
synergistic therapy of RA by using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified folate 
(FA)-conjugated liposomes (LPs) loaded with dexamethasone sodium phosphate 
(DexSP) (DexSP@LPs-PEG-FA). The UTMD-mediated DexSP@LPs-PEG-FA for targeted 
delivery of DexSP including a synergistic ultrasonic cavitation effect and drug 
therapy were investigated through in vitro RAW264.7 cell experiments and in vivo 
collagen-induced arthritis SD rat model animal experiments. The results show the 
DexSP release from targeted liposomes was improved under the UTMD effect. 
Likewise, the folate-conjugated liposomes displayed targeting association to 
RAW264.7 cells. Together with the application of ultrasound and microbubbles, 
liposomes-delivered DexSP potently reduced joints swelling, bone erosion, and 
inflammation in both joints and serum with a low dose. These results 
demonstrated that UTMD-mediated folate-conjugated liposomes are not only a 
promising method for targeted synergistic treatment of RA but also may show high 
potential for serving as nanomedicines for many other biomedical fields.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bee venom (BV) has been used for the treatment 
of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and for the relief of 
pain in traditional oriental medicine.
AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine the anti-inflammatory 
effect of BV on monosodium urate (MSU)-induced gouty arthritis in a mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To develop a mouse model of acute gouty arthritis, 4 mg 
50 μL-1 of MSU crystal suspension was injected intradermally into the right paw. 
After MSU crystal injection, we evaluated inflammatory cytokine production in 
mice of the BV-treated (0.5 and 1 mg kg-1 body weight) and apamin (APM)-treated 
(0.5 and 1 mg kg-1 body weight) groups. The positive control group was 
administered a colchicine (1 mg kg-1 body weight) injection with MSU crystals.
RESULTS: BV and APM treatment suppressed inflammatory paw edema in 
MSU-administered mice. It also exerted anti-inflammatory effects in mice with 
gouty arthritis by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production and 
inflammasome formation. Interestingly, MSU crystal formation was decreased by BV 
and APM treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the APM from BV might be useful for the 
treatment of gouty arthritis due to its anti-inflammatory activities.

Survivin which is an inhibitor of apoptosis upregulation has been reported in 
human autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, juvenile

This research aims to coat Teriflunomide (TEF) loaded conventional nanoliposomes 
(CON-TEF-LIPO) with Chondroitin sulphate (CS) to produce CS-TEF-LIPO for the 
effective treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both CON-TEF-LIPO and 
CS-TEF-LIPO were produced, characterized and evaluated for their active 
targeting potential towards CD44 receptors. Cell cytotoxicity, cell viability 
and intracellular uptake study on differentiated U937 and MG-63 cells 
demonstrated the active targeting of CS-TEF-LIPO towards CD44 receptors. 
Furthermore, in vivo pharmacodynamic, biochemical, radiological and 
histopathological studies performed in adjuvant induced arthritic (AIA) rat 
model showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in inflammation in arthritic rat 
paw in CS-TEF-LIPO group compared to TEF and CON-TEF-LIPO groups. Moreover, 
liver toxicity study revealed that CS-TEF-LIPO showed no signs of toxicity and 
biodistribution study revealed the accumulation of CS-TEF-LIPO in synovial 
region of arthritic rat. Taken together, results suggest that CS-TEF-LIPO could 
provide a new insight for an effective treatment of RA.

Pain is a principal contributor to the global burden of arthritis with 
peripheral sensitization being a major cause of arthritis-related pain. Within 
the knee joint, distal endings of dorsal root ganglion neurons (knee neurons) 
interact with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and the inflammatory mediators 
they secrete, which are thought to promote peripheral sensitization. 
Correspondingly, RNA sequencing has demonstrated detectable levels of 
proinflammatory genes in FLS derived from arthritis patients. This study 
confirms that stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) results in 
expression of proinflammatory genes in mouse and human FLS (derived from 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients), as well as increased 
secretion of cytokines from mouse TNF-α-stimulated FLS (TNF-FLS). 
Electrophysiological recordings from retrograde labelled knee neurons cocultured 
with TNF-FLS, or supernatant derived from TNF-FLS, revealed a depolarized 
resting membrane potential, increased spontaneous action potential firing, and 
enhanced TRPV1 function, all consistent with a role for FLS in mediating the 
sensitization of pain-sensing nerves in arthritis. Therefore, data from this 
study demonstrate the ability of FLS activated by TNF-α to promote neuronal 
sensitization, results that highlight the importance of both nonneuronal and 
neuronal cells to the development of pain in arthritis.

PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a commonly diagnosed systemic autoimmune 
disease. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is closely linked 
to the development of RA. This study was conducted to explore the functions of 
the lncRNA LINC01197 in RA progression.
METHODS: Differentially expressed lncRNAs/microRNAs/mRNAs in patients with RA 
were analyzed using RNA microarrays. A mouse model with RA was established and 
RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were acquired for in vitro experiments. 
The function of LINC01197 in inflammation and RA progression in mice and its 
role in the viability of RA-FLS were determined by experiments involving its 
overexpression or suppression. The sub-cellular localization of LINC01197 was 
determined and the downstream molecules involved in LINC01197-mediated events 
were identified.
RESULTS: LINC01197 was poorly expressed in the synovial tissues in the RA model 
mice. Overexpression of LINC01197 reduced RA severity in mice and inhibited 
proliferation and inflammatory responses as well as promoted apoptosis in 
RA-FLS. Online predictions and dual luciferase reporter gene assays suggested 
that LINC01197 could bind to miR-150 and further regulate THBS2 expression. 
LINC01197 promoted THBS2 expression through miR-150 sponging and inactivated the 
TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, thus alleviating RA inflammation.
CONCLUSION: The current study suggested that LINC01197 sponged miR-150 to 
promote THBS2 expression, leading to TLR4/NF-κB inactivation, and ameliorated RA 
inflammation. These findings may offer new insights into RA treatment.

BACKGROUND: This study sought to assess the effect of hesperidin on serum 
inflammatory cytokines and oxidative damage in liver of complete Freund's 
adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritic rats.
METHOD: Fifty-six adult female Wistar rats (220-250 g) were acclimatized for two 
weeks. Intraplantar injection of CFA was done for the induction of arthritis and 
confirmed on the 14th day prior to oral administration of 40 and 80 mg/kg of 
hesperidin or dexamethasone for 45 days.
RESULT: The result showed that treatment with both doses of hesperidin and 
dexamethasone in the joint of arthritic rats significantly (p < .05) diminished 
paw swelling/edema and arthritis score as well as enhanced latency in thermal 
hyperalgesia test. In addition, hesperidin treatment in arthritis rats showed 
significant (p < .01) improvement in red blood cells and platelets counts as 
well as hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to the arthritis control rat group. 
Furthermore, hesperidin treatment significantly (p < .05) reduced serum 
interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels in arthritic rat. In 
addition, treatment with hesperidin significantly (p < .05) decreased the liver 
of thiobarbituric acid reactive species and reactive oxygen species levels but 
raised the levels of total and non-protein thiols of rat induced with CFA. The 
reduced activities of liver δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase, catalase, 
glutathione-S transferase in arthritic rats were significantly (p < .05) 
increased with hesperidin treatment in arthritic rats. This study suggests that 
hesperidin demonstrated an anti-arthritic effect via modulation of serum IFN-γ 
and IL-4 levels as well as protection against oxidative damage.
CONCLUSION: Hence, hesperidin could be a potential immune-modulatory, 
anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent.

BACKGROUND: Although tofacitinib has shown highly significant efficacy for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there are still a considerable number of patients 
that are non-responders owing to its limited effectiveness and various adverse 
effects. Thus, alternative options with better efficacy and lower toxicity are 
desired. Here, M-134, a recently developed HDAC6 inhibitor, was examined for its 
therapeutic potential when combined with tofacitinib in a rat model of RA.
METHODS: The single or combined administration of M-134 and tofacitinib was 
examined in complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) or 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rodent models. To evaluate the therapeutic and 
adverse effects, the following factors were observed: macroscopic or microscopic 
scoring of all four paws; the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IP-10 in the 
joints and that of various cytokines and chemokines in the plasma; the weight of 
the thymus and the liver; and changes in hematological enzymes.
RESULTS: Combination treatment showed strong synergistic effects as measured by 
the clinical score and histological changes, without adverse effects such as 
weight loss in the thymus and increased liver enzymes (ALT and AST). 
Additionally, it also reduced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IP-10 expression in the 
joints, and M-134 increased the efficacy of tofacitinib by regulating various 
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, and TNF-α, in the serum of AIA 
rats. Differences in the cytokine expression for each drug were found in the CIA 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: M-134 and tofacitinib combination therapy is a potential option for 
the treatment of RA through the regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and 
adhesion molecules.

PURPOSE: The aim of the experiment was to explore the effect of eriodictyol 
(ERI) on arthritis.
METHODS: We established a rat model of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis 
(CIA) using type II collagen plus Freund's complete adjuvant. We evaluated the 
degree of paw swelling, joint pathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, and the 
Akt/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α signaling pathway in the CIA rats.
RESULTS: ERI significantly ameliorated joint swelling; improved joint pathology; 
and suppressed the release of interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha. Moreover, ERI inhibited the Akt/HIF-1α pathway in the 
joints of rats and in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW264.7 cells.
CONCLUSION: ERI ameliorated arthritis in a manner involving the Akt/HIF-1α 
signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that 
can effectively control the pain and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), but its usage is limited due to severe adverse effects. For this reason, 
making more specific formulations of this drug can be considered. The aim of the 
present study was designing a novel nano-sized indomethacin delivery system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Indomethacin-loaded dextran stearate polymeric micelles 
were prepared by dialysis method. Particle size and zeta potential of micelles 
were measured by a zeta sizer instrument. Drug release from micelles was 
investigated in phosphate buffer medium pH 7.4 and then the best formulation 
regarding physical properties and drug release was selected for animal studies. 
Arthritis was induced by complete Freund's adjuvant injection in rats. Then, the 
animals were randomly assigned into the model, the indomethacin solution and the 
polymeric micelles groups. The clinical effects of polymeric micelle formulation 
were assessed by measuring arthritis index, animal paw edema and measuring 
biochemical parameters including myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, lipid 
peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), TNF-α, 
IL-17 and IL-1β.
RESULTS: Paw edema was attenuated following the administration of 
indomethacin-loaded polymeric micelles. Based on the findings of the present 
study, the use of indomethacin-loaded polymeric micelles could improve 
inflammatory symptoms, decrease arthritis index and decrease the diameter of the 
paw in arthritic rats in a significant manner (p ≤ 0.05). In addition, the use 
of polymeric micelles like indomethacin solution significantly reduced 
(p ≤ 0.05) the activity of MPO, LPO, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-1β, and made a 
significant increase (p ≤ 0.05) in glutathione and TAC content and ameliorated 
structural changes in the paw tissue compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that indomethacin-loaded dextran stearate 
polymeric micelles can provide more effective therapeutic effects in control of 
inflammation in arthritis in rat.

OBJECTIVE: RasGTPases are master regulators of multiple intracellular signaling 
cascades. Perturbation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study we aimed to define the therapeutic 
potential of a novel RasGTPases inhibitor, farnesylthiosalicylate (FTS), in the 
preclinical mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and better delineate 
its immunomodulatory effects both ex vivo and in the mouse.
METHODS: We analyzed in vitro the immunomodulatory effects of FTS on various 
CD4+ T-cell functions such as activation, proliferation, T-helper polarization, 
and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Using the CIA model, we further 
determined the efficacy of FTS to inhibit clinical, histopathologic, and diverse 
immunological outcomes of arthritis.
RESULTS: FTS treatment of CD4+ T cells in vitro effectively targeted distinct 
kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38, protein kinase B/AKT, 
and mammalian target of rapamycin), the production of interleukin (IL)-17A, 
IL-22, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and Th17 
polarization. FTS therapy in the mouse CIA model significantly reduced clinical 
disease severity and joint inflammation/damage by histology. Importantly, FTS 
suppressed the in vivo induction of splenic IL-17+ IL-22+ Th17 cells and the 
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The production of pathogenic 
autoantibodies and their abnormal hyposialylation was significantly attenuated 
by FTS therapy. Importantly, in vivo generation of collagen type-II specific 
effector CD4+ T cells was likewise repressed by FTS therapy.
CONCLUSION: The RasGTPases inhibitor FTS attenuates the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines by in vitro-activated T cells and is a potent 
immunomodulatory compound in the CIA model, primarily targeting the generation 
of autoreactive Th17 cells and the production of autoantibodies and their 
subsequent pathogenic hyposialylation.

The promising potential of nano-structured lipid carrier (NLC) polymeric gel of 
CUR as an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis by intra-articular route 
of administration was investigated. NLC composed of cetylpalmitate, Labrafac PG 
& Captex 200, Tween 80 and Labrasol. The hot homogenization method employed by 
melt ultrasonication was used. The formulated NLC dispersions were characterized 
and were suitably dispersed into the matrix of pluronic F-127(PLF-127) and 
pluronic F-68 (PLF-68). A two-factor three-level full factorial design was 
employed to deduce the optimal concentrations of PLF-127 and PLF-68. The 
optimized formulations were sterilized by gamma radiation. The formulated NLC 
smart gels were characterized and evaluated for various parameters. The efficacy 
evaluation by antigen-induced monoarthritis model and biocompatibility testing 
by histopathological studies was performed. Formulated NLCs exhibited an average 
particle size of 165.12 nm, entrapment efficiency of 72.15%, and zeta potential 
of -21.67 mV. The optimized CUR-NLC smart gel was demonstrated to have a sol-gel 
transformation at 33.21 °C and 94.32% drug release at 84 h. NLC's which were 
sterile and easily syringeable, continued to remain within the colloidal range. 
CUR-NLC smart gels were found to be biocompatible and showed a significant 
reduction in rat knee joint inflammation compared to free drug.

Non-invasive imaging of arthritis activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 
using macrophage PET holds promise for early diagnosis and therapeutic response 
monitoring. Previously obtained results with macrophage tracer (R)-[11C]PK11195 
were encouraging, but the imaging signal could be further improved by reduction 
of background uptake. Recently, the novel macrophage tracer 
[18F]fluoro-PEG-folate was developed. This tracer showed excellent targeting of 
the folate receptor β on activated macrophages in synovial tissue in a 
preclinical arthritic rat model. We performed three substudies to investigate 
the biodistribution, potential for imaging arthritis and kinetic properties of 
[18F]fluoro-PEG-folate in RA patients. Firstly, biodistribution demonstrated 
fast clearance of [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate from heart and blood vessels and no 
dose limiting uptake in organs. Secondly, [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate showed uptake 
in arthritic joints with significantly lower background and hence significantly 
higher target-to-background ratios as compared to reference macrophage tracer 
(R)-[11C]PK11195. Lastly, dynamic scanning demonstrated fast tracer uptake in 
affected joints, reaching a plateau after 1 minute, co-existing with a rapid 
blood clearance. In conclusion, this first in man study demonstrates the 
potential of [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate to image arthritis activity in RA with 
favourable imaging characteristics of rapid clearance and low background uptake, 
that allow for detection of inflammatory activity in the whole body.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common inflammatory disorder of the joints 
characterized by synovitis and pannus formation, often results in irreversible 
joint erosion and disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line drug against 
RA, but the therapeutic effects are sub-optimal due to its poor retention at the 
target sites and systemic side effects. Multifunctional nanoparticles are highly 
promising agents for minimally invasive, traceable and effective targeted 
therapy. Methods: This study developed iRGD peptide-functionalized echogenic 
liposomes (iELPs) which encapsulates MTX and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent 
probe through the thin film-hydration method. Results: The resulting iELPs 
showed high affinity for endothelial cells overexpressing αvβ3 integrin, 
favorable acoustic response and fluorescence tracking properties. Also, 
near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of iELPs and ultrasound-triggered drug 
release of MTX were proved in a mouse RA model, greatly improving the 
therapeutic efficacy and reducing MTX side effects. Histological assessment of 
the articular tissues further revealed significantly lower inflammatory cell 
infiltration and angiogenesis in the iELPs-treated and sonicated mice. 
Conclusion: Our study provides a promising nanoplatform for integrating 
ultrasound-controlled drug release and NIR fluorescence imaging for RA 
treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic 
inflammation in synovial joints and protease-induced cartilage degradation. 
Current biologic treatments for RA can effectively reduce symptoms, primarily by 
neutralizing the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα; however, continued, 
indiscriminate overinhibition of inflammatory factors can significantly weaken 
the host immune system, leading to opportunistic infections and interrupting 
treatment. We hypothesize that localizing anti-TNFα therapeutics to denatured 
collagen (dCol) present at arthritic joints, via conjugation with 
collagen-hybridizing peptides (CHPs), will reduce off-site antigen binding and 
maintain local immunosuppression. We isolated the antigen-binding fragment of 
the clinically approved anti-TNFα therapeutic infliximab (iFab) and prepared 
iFab-CHP conjugates via lysine-based conjugation with an SMCC linker. After 
successful conjugation, confirmed by LC-MS, the binding affinity of iFab-CHP was 
characterized by ELISA-like assays, which showed comparable antigen binding 
relative to infliximab, comparable dCol binding relative to CHP, and the hybrid 
ability to bind both dCol and TNFα simultaneously. We further demonstrated 
localization of Fab-CHP to areas of high dCol in vivo and promising therapeutic 
efficacy, assessed by histological staining (Safranin-O and H&E), in a pilot 
mouse study.

Areas of locally decreased pH are characteristic for many chronic inflammatory 
diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, acute pathologies 
such as ischemia reperfusion, and tumor microenvironment. The data on the 
effects of extracellular acidic pH on inflammation are conflicting with respect 
to interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) as one of the most potent proinflammatory 
cytokines. In this study, we used various mouse- and human-derived cells in 
order to identify potential species-specific differences in IL-1β secretion 
pattern in response to extracellular acidification. We found that a short 
incubation in mild acidic medium caused significant IL-1β release from human 
macrophages, however, the same effect was not observed in mouse macrophages. 
Rather, a marked IL-1β suppression was observed when mouse cells were stimulated 
with a combination of various inflammasome instigators and low pH. Upon 
activation of cells under acidic conditions, the cytosolic pH was reduced while 
metabolic activity and the expression of the main inflammasome proteins were not 
affected by low pH. We show that IL-1β secretion in mouse macrophages is 
reversible upon restoration of physiological pH. pH sensitivity of NLRP3, NLRC4 
and AIM2 inflammasomes appeared to be conferred by the processes upstream of the 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization 
and most likely contributed by the cell background rather than species-specific 
amino acid sequences of the sensor proteins.

NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? What are the functions 
of long non-coding (lnc) RNA OIP5-AS1 in development of rheumatoid arthritis 
inflammation and what is the molecular mechanism? What is the main finding and 
its importance? LncRNA OIP5-AS1 mitigates rheumatoid arthritis progression 
through the competitive endogenous RNA network involving the miR-448-paraoxonase 
1 axis and through the inactivation of the toll-like receptor 3-nuclear factor 
κB signalling pathway. This study may offer new ideas for molecularly based 
control of rheumatoid arthritis.
ABSTRACT: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder with dysregulation 
of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) possibly involved. This study aimed to inquire 
into the roles of lncRNA OIP5-AS1 in RA progression. A rat model of RA was 
induced. Overexpression of OIP5-AS1 was introduced in the model rats, and the 
changes in paw swelling, RA severity and the inflammatory factors interleukin 
(IL)-1β, IL-10, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor α were measured. Fibroblast-like 
synoviocytes (FLSs) from RA patients were collected for in vitro experiments. A 
gain- and loss-of function study of OIP5-AS1, miR-448 and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) 
was performed to explore their roles in RA-FLS growth, apoptosis and 
inflammation. A toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-specific agonist, 
polyinosine-polycytidylic acid, or a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-specific 
antagonist, QNZ, was administrated in RA-FLSs. Consequently, overexpression of 
OIP5-AS1 reduced the symptom severity and the levels of inflammatory factors in 
RA rats. OIP5-AS1 could bind to miR-448 to up-regulate PON1 expression. Further 
overexpression of miR-448 reversed the effects of OIP5-AS1, while overexpression 
of PON1 inhibited RA-FLS growth and inflammation. In addition, TLR3 activation 
promoted RA progression. To conclude, this study evidenced that lncRNA OIP5-AS1 
may mitigate RA progression through the miR-448-PON1 axis and through the 
inactivation of the TLR3-NF-κB signalling pathway.

Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and a 
worldwide urgent public health threat. Without doubt, there is an urgent need 
for new effective anticlostridial agents due to the increasing incidence and 
severity of C. difficile infection (CDI). The aim of the present study is to 
investigate the in vivo efficacy of auranofin (rheumatoid arthritis FDA-approved 
drug) in a CDI mouse model and establish an adequate dosage for treatment. The 
effects of increased C. difficile inoculum, and pre-exposure to simulated 
gastric intestinal fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), on the 
antibacterial activity of auranofin were investigated. Auranofin's in vitro 
antibacterial activity was stable in the presence of high bacterial inoculum 
size compared to vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Moreover, it maintained its anti-C. 
difficile activity after being exposed to SGF and SIF. Upon testing in a CDI 
mouse model, auranofin at low clinically achievable doses (0.125 mg/kg and 
0.25 mg/kg) significantly protected mice against CDI with 100% and 80% survival, 
respectively. Most importantly, auranofin (0.125 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg) 
significantly prevented CDI recurrence when compared with vancomycin. 
Collectively, these results indicate that auranofin could potentially provide an 
effective, safe and quick supplement to the current approaches for treating CDI.

Despite their notorious adverse effects, glucocorticoids (GC, potent 
anti-inflammatory drugs) are used extensively in clinical management of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory diseases. To achieve a 
sustained therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicities, macromolecular GC 
prodrugs have been developed with promising outcomes for the treatment of RA. 
Fine-tuning the activation kinetics of these prodrugs may further improve their 
therapeutic efficacy and minimize the off-target adverse effects. To assess the 
feasibility of this strategy, five different dexamethasone (Dex, a potent 
GC)-containing monomers with distinctively different linker chemistries were 
designed, synthesized, and copolymerized with N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide 
(HPMA) to obtain 5 macromolecular Dex prodrugs. Their Dex releasing rates were 
analyzed in vitro and shown to display a wide spectrum of activation kinetics. 
Their therapeutic efficacy and preliminary toxicology profiles were assessed and 
compared in vivo in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rat model in order to 
identify the ideal prodrug design for the most effective and safe treatment of 
inflammatory arthritis. The in vivo data demonstrated that the C3 hydrazone 
linker-containing prodrug design was the most effective in preserving joint 
structural integrity. The results from this study suggest that the design and 
screening of different activation mechanisms may help to identify macromolecular 
prodrugs with the most potent therapeutic efficacy and safety for the management 
of inflammatory arthritis.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the therapeutic effect of human dental pulp stem 
cells (DPSCs) transfected with adenovirus expressing hepatocyte growth factor 
(HGF) in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: DPSCs were modified with Ad-HGF to produce HGF-overexpressing DPSCs, 
DPSCs-HGF. In experimental mouse CIA model, DPSCs-HGF and DPSCs-Null (modified 
with Ad-Null) were engrafted via intravenously after disease onset, which was 
determined by the presence of joint swelling. The therapeutic effects on joints 
were evaluated at 49 days after collagen injection by histopathological analysis 
and microcomputed tomography imaging. The inflammatory cytokines were analyzed 
both in sera and joints via MILLIPLEX kit and immunohistochemical staining, 
respectively, and the regulatory T cells (Tregs) were analyzed in peripheral 
blood by using flow cytometry. Furthermore, primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
were isolated, colony formation analysis and FACS were performed to evaluate the 
effect of HGF on the proliferation and cell cycle of FLSs. Western blot assay 
was carried out to clarify the signal pathway of HGF-cMet.
RESULTS: We found that without HGF modification, DPSC transfusion was helpful in 
controlling autoimmune status, local synovitis, and bone erosion after 
intravenous administration. However, HGF-modified DPSCs have dual role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the early phase, HGF overexpression inhibited RA 
progression by its immunosuppressive effects, while in the late phase, HGF 
promoted synovitis by activating fibroblast-like synoviocytes to produce 
pathogenic IL-6, accelerating cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis 
resistance via phosphorylating the c-Met/Akt pathway. The overall effect of HGF 
modification attenuated the therapeutic effect of DPSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the therapeutic 
effect of DPSCs in the mouse model and a primary answer to the divergence of 
whether HGF is harmful or helpful in RA.

PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) drives inflammation and bone 
degradation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some RA patients 
experience a rapid clinical response to TNFα inhibitors such as certolizumab 
pegol (CZP) while other patients show limited to no response. Current methods 
for imaging RA have limited sensitivity and do not assist in the selection of 
patients most likely to respond to immune-mediated therapy. Herein, we developed 
a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for immuno-PET imaging of 
TNFα in transgenic human TNFα-expressing mice.
PROCEDURES: CZP was modified with p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-deferoxamine (DFO) and 
radiolabeled with Zr-89. The biological activity of [89Zr]DFO-CZP was evaluated 
by HPLC and binding assay using human recombinant TNFα (hTNFα). The feasibility 
of specific immuno-PET imaging of human TNFα was assessed in a transgenic mouse 
model of RA that expresses human TNFα. This model resembles the progression of 
RA in humans by maintaining lower levels of circulating hTNFα and exhibits 
chronic arthritis in the forepaw and hind paw joints. The dosimetry of 
[89Zr]DFO-CZP in humans was estimated using microPET/CT imaging in Sprague 
Dawley rats.
RESULTS: [89Zr]DFO-CZP was isolated with radiolabeling yields of 85 ± 6 % 
(n = 5) and specific activities ranging from 74 to 185 MBq/mg (n = 5). Following 
size exclusion purification, the radiochemical purity of [89Zr]DFO-CZP was 
greater than 97 %. [89Zr]DFO-CZP retained high immunoreactivity with more than 
95 % of the radioactivity shifted into higher molecular weight complexes. Images 
showed increasing uptake of the tracer in forepaw and hind paw joints with 
disease progression. No uptake was observed in the model previously administered 
with an excess amount of unmodified CZP and in normal control mice, 
demonstrating in vivo specific uptake of [89Zr]DFO-CZP.
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of immuno-PET imaging of human TNFα with 
[89Zr]DFO-CZP has been demonstrated in a preclinical model of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis share many epidemiological and 
pathological features, with emerging studies reporting a relationship between 
the two diseases. Recently, RA and periodontitis have been associated with 
autophagy. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cathepsin K 
(CtsK) inhibition on RA with periodontitis in a mouse model and its 
immunological function affecting autophagy. To topically inhibit CtsK 
periodontitis with arthritis in the animal model, adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
transfection was performed in periodontal and knee joint regions. Transfection 
of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed to inhibit CtsK in RAW264.7 
cells. The effects of CtsK inhibition on the autophagy pathway were then 
evaluated in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. RA and periodontitis 
aggravated destruction and inflammation in their respective lesion areas. 
Inhibition of CtsK had multiple effects: (i) reduced destruction of alveolar 
bone and articular tissue, (ii) decreased macrophage numbers and inflammatory 
cytokine expression in the synovium, and (iii) alleviated expression of the 
autophagy-related transcription factor EB (TFEB) and microtubule-associated 
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) at the protein level in knee joints. 
Inhibition of CtsK in vitro reduced the expression of autophagy-related proteins 
and related inflammatory factors. Our data revealed that the inhibition of CtsK 
resisted the destruction of articular tissues and relieved inflammation from RA 
with periodontitis. Furthermore, CtsK was implicated as an imperative regulator 
of the autophagy pathway in RA and macrophages.

Bone erosion is a debilitating pathological process of osteopathic disorder like 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Current treatment strategies render low disease 
activity but with disease recurrence. To find an alternative, we designed this 
study with an aim to explore the underlying therapeutic effect of PEGylated 
liposomal BBR (PEG-BBR) against Wnt1/β-catenin mediated bone erosion in 
adjuvant-induced arthritic (AA) rat model and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) 
with reference to microRNA-23a (miR-23a) activity. Our initial studies using 
confocal microscopy and Near-Infrared Imaging (NIR) showed successful 
internalization of PEG-BBR and PEG-miR-23a in vitro and in vivo respectively and 
was retained till 48 h. The preferential internalization of PEG-BBR into the 
inflamed joint region significantly reduced the gene and protein level 
expression of major Wnt1 signaling mediators and reduced bone erosion in rats. 
Moreover, PEG-BBR treatment in FLS cells attenuated the gene and protein 
expression levels of FZD4, LRP5, β-catenin, and Dvl-1 through the induction of 
CYLD. Furthermore, inhibition of these factors resulted in reduced bone loss and 
increased calcium retainability by altering the RANKL/OPG axis. PEG-BBR 
treatment markedly inhibited the expression of LRP5 protein on par with the 
DKK-1 (LRP5/Wnt signaling inhibitor) and suppressed the transcriptional 
activation of β-catenin inside the cells. We further witnessed that miR-23a 
altered the expression levels of LRP5 through RNA interference. Overall, our 
findings endorsed that miR-23a possesses a multifaceted therapeutic efficiency 
like berberine in RA pathogenesis and can be considered as a potential candidate 
for therapeutic targeting of Wnt1/β-catenin signaling in RA disease condition.

DEK protein is critical to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps 
(NETs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blocking DEK using the aptamer DTA via 
articular injection has been shown to have robust anti-inflammatory efficacy in 
a previous study. However, DTA is prone to nuclease degradation and renal 
clearance in vivo. RA is a systemic disease that involves multiple joints, and 
local injection is impractical in clinical settings. In this study, DTA was 
modified with methoxy groups on all deoxyribose sugar units and inverted 
deoxythymidine on the 3' end (DTA4) to enhance its stability against nuclease. 
DTA4 is stable for 72 h in 90% mouse serum and maintains a high binding affinity 
to DEK. DTA4 effectively inhibits the formation of NETs and the migration of 
HUVECs in vitro. DTA4 was then modified with cholesterol on its 5' end to form 
DTA6. DTA6 dramatically reduces DEK expression in inflammatory RAW264.7 cells. A 
hydrogel microneedle (hMN) was then fabricated for the transdermal delivery of 
DTA6. The hMN maintains morphological integrity after absorbing the aptamer 
solution, effectively pierces the skin, and rapidly releases DTA6 into the 
dermis. The DTA6-loaded hMN significantly attenuates inflammation and protects 
joints from cartilage/bone erosion in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chronic inflammation induces transcriptomic and 
epigenetic modifications that imparts a persistent catabolic phenotype to the 
FLS, despite their dissociation from the inflammatory environment. We analyzed 
high throughput gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from human and 
mouse FLS from our and other studies available on public repositories, with the 
goal of identifying the persistently reprogrammed signaling pathways driven by 
chronic inflammation. We found that the gene expression changes induced by 
short-term tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) treatment were largely sustained in 
the FLS exposed to chronic inflammation. These changes that included both 
activation and repression of gene expression, were accompanied by the remodeling 
of chromatin accessibility. The sustained activated genes (SAGs) included 
established pro-inflammatory signaling components known to act at multiple 
levels of NF-kappaB, STAT and AP-1 signaling cascades. Interestingly, the 
sustained repressed genes (SRGs) included critical mediators and targets of the 
BMP signaling pathway. We thus identified sustained repression of BMP signaling 
as a unique constituent of the long-term inflammatory memory induced by chronic 
inflammation. We postulate that simultaneous targeting of these activated and 
repressed signaling pathways may be necessary to combat RA persistence.

INTRODUCTION: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoglobulin G is a 
recently discovered biomarker of an autoimmune central nervous system disorder 
characterized by a steroid-responsive meningoencephalomyelitis.
CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis on etanercept presented 
with steroid-responsive subacute encephalopathy and foot drop. Brain and sural 
nerve biopsies demonstrated a T-cell perivascular infiltrate. Cerebrospinal 
fluid studies 18 months into the course of the illness demonstrated a GFAP 
antibody on mouse tissue immunofluorescence confirmed by cell-based assay. The 
patient was treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide leading to resolution of 
his symptoms.
CONCLUSION: This case expands on the previously reported cases of GFAP 
immunoglobulin G autoimmunity by describing an associated inflammatory large 
fiber peripheral neuropathy.

The decision to pursue a monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a therapeutic for disease 
intervention requires the assessment of many factors, such as target-biology, 
including the total target burden and its accessibility at the intended site of 
action, as well as mAb-specific properties like binding affinity and the 
pharmacokinetics in serum and tissue. Interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36 R) is a 
member of the IL-1 family cytokine receptors and an attractive target to treat 
numerous epithelial-mediated inflammatory conditions, including psoriatic and 
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
However, information concerning the expression profile of IL-36 R at the protein 
level is minimal, so the feasibility of developing a therapeutic mAb against 
this target is uncertain. Here, we present a characterization of the properties 
associated with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a 
high-affinity IL-36 R-targeted surrogate rat (IgG2a) mAb antagonist in 
preclinical mouse models. The presence of IL-36 R in the periphery was confirmed 
unequivocally as the driver of non-linear pharmacokinetics in blood/serum, 
although a predominant site of tissue accumulation was not observed based upon 
the kinetics of radiotracer. Additionally, the contribution of IL-36 R-mediated 
catabolism of mAb in kidney was tested in a 5/6 nephrectomized mouse model where 
minimal effects on serum pharmacokinetics were observed, although analysis of 
functional mAb in urine suggests that target can influence the amount of mAb 
excreted. Our data highlight an interesting case of target-mediated drug 
disposition (TMDD) where low, yet broadly expressed levels of membrane-bound 
target result in a cumulative effect to drive TMDD behavior typical of a large, 
saturable target sink. The potential differences between our mouse model and 
IL-36 R target profile in humans are also presented.

OBJECTIVES: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 promotes inflammation. We investigated 
the anti-arthritic effects of CKD-506, a novel HDAC6 inhibitor, in vitro and in 
a murine model of arthritis as a novel treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).
METHODS: HDAC6 was overexpressed in mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 
cells, and the effects of a HDAC6 inhibitor CKD-506 on cytokine production and 
activity of NF-κB and AP-1 signaling were examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were 
activated in the presence of CKD-506. Next, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were 
induced from RA patients and co-cultured with healthy effector T cells (Teffs) 
and cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry. Finally, the effects of 
the inhibitor on the severity of arthritis were assessed in a murine model of 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA).
RESULTS: Overexpression of HDAC6 induced macrophages to produce TNF-α and IL-6. 
The inhibitory effect of CKD-506 was mediated via blockade of NF-κB and AP-1 
activation. HDAC6 inhibition reduced TNF-α and IL-6 production by activated RA 
PBMCs. CKD-506 inhibited production of MMP-1, MMP-3, IL-6, and IL-8 by activated 
FLS. In addition, CKD-506 inhibited proliferation of Teffs directly and 
indirectly by improving iTreg function. In AIA rats, oral CKD-506 improved 
clinical arthritis in a dose-dependent manner. A combination of sub-therapeutic 
CKD-506 and methotrexate exerted a synergistic effect.
CONCLUSION: The novel HDAC6 inhibitor CKD-506 suppresses inflammatory responses 
by monocytes/macrophages, improves Treg function, and ameliorates arthritis 
severity in a murine model of RA. Thus, CKD-506 might be a novel and effective 
treatment option for RA.

The co-delivery of nanoparticles encapsulating gene therapies and 
chemotherapeutic drugs can achieve synergistic treatment and reduce side effects 
in normal tissues relative to the systemic use of single drug delivery. 
Activated macrophages play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural polysaccharide, is a specific 
ligand for CD44 that is overexpressed on the surface of activated macrophages. 
In this study, HA-coated pH-responsive nanoparticles loaded with MCL-1 small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) and dexamethasone (HNPs/MD) were developed for RA 
treatment. The HNPs/MD had a mean particle size of 117.07 ± 2.21 nm and zeta 
potential of 15.53 ± 1.06 mV. The release rates of both MCL-1 siRNA and 
dexamethasone from the HNPs/MD at pH 4.5 and 6.0 were higher than those at pH 
7.4, indicating that the nanoparticles were acid-sensitive. Cytotoxicity assays 
showed that compared with single drug loaded nanoparticles, the HNPs/MD showed 
higher cytotoxicity to activated macrophages. The superior therapeutic effect of 
HNPs/MD was demonstrated in an adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model. These 
findings indicate that pH-sensitive and HA-targeting co-delivery nanoparticles 
provide a new direction for the therapy of RA.

Some important pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis 
factor-α and nitric oxide are thought to play key roles in the destruction of 
cartilage and bone tissue in joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. In the 
present study, a series of new myricetin-pentadienone hybrids were designed and 
synthesized. Majority of them effectively inhibited the expressions 
liposaccharide-induced secretion of IL-6, TNF-α and NO in RAW264.7. The most 
prominent compound 5o could significantly decrease production of above 
inflammatory factors with IC50 values of 5.22 µM, 8.22 µM and 9.31 µM, 
respectively. Preliminary mechanism studies indicated that it could inhibit the 
expression of thioredoxin reductase, resulting in inhibiting of cell signaling 
pathway nuclear factor (N-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. 
Significantly, compound 5o was found to effectively inhibit Freund's complete 
adjuvant induced rat adjuvant arthritis in vivo.

SCOPE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder related to the 
inflammation of cartilage due to the infiltration of inflammatory cells. 
Sargassum serratifolium, a brown alga, possesses strong anti-inflammatory 
activities.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of meroterpenoid-rich fraction from the ethanol 
extract of S. serratifolium (MES) on RA and its underlying mechanisms on the 
inhibition of RA using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model are 
examined. The results show that MES ameliorates paw swelling and reduces the 
arthritis score. MES considerably decreases the secretion of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in the serum and joint tissue of mice. Histopathological analysis 
demonstrates that MES strongly inhibited bone damage and inflammatory cell 
intrusion in the joint tissue. The expression of inflammatory enzymes and 
adhesion molecules is significantly inhibited in the serum and joint tissue of 
MES-fed mice. In addition, MES downregulates the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 
signaling pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of protein kinase B, c-Jun 
N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases.
CONCLUSIONS: MES supplementation remarkably reduces inflammatory response in CIA 
mouse model. These results indicate that MES can be used as a pharmaceutical 
agent against RA.

Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) and β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 
(ST6GAL1) are glycosyltransferases that catalyze α1,6-fucosylation and 
α2,6-sialylation, respectively, in the mammalian N-glycosylation pathway. They 
are aberrantly expressed in various human diseases. FUT8 is non-glycosylated but 
is responsible for the fucosylation of ST6GAL1. However, the mechanism for the 
interaction between these two enzymes is unknown. In this study, we show that 
serum levels of α2,6-sialylated N-glycans are increased in Fut8-/- mice, whereas 
the mRNA and protein levels of ST6GAL1 are unchanged in mouse live tissues. The 
level of α2,6-sialylation on IgG was also enhanced in Fut8-/- mice along with 
ST6GAL1 catalytic activity increase in both serum and liver. Moreover, it was 
observed that ST6GAL1 prefers non-fucosylated substrates. Interestingly, 
increased core fucosylation accompanied by a reduction in α2,6-sialylation, was 
detected in rheumatoid arthritis patient serum. These findings provide new 
insight into the interactions between FUT8 and ST6GAL1.

Type II collagen (CII) is the most abundant protein in joint cartilage. 
Antibodies to CII appear around the clinical onset of the autoimmune disease 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a subset of patients. They target specific epitopes 
on CII and can be pathogenic or protective. Assays for early detection of such 
autoantibodies may provide new opportunities for selecting effective treatment 
strategies of RA. We report the efficient and reproducible assembly of an array 
of covalently branched native and citrullinated triple helical peptides (THPs) 
from CII that contain defined autoantibody epitopes. Both monoclonal antibodies 
and sera from experimental mouse models show a unique reactivity toward the 
THPs, compared to cyclic peptides containing the epitopes, revealing the 
importance that the epitopes are displayed in a triple-helical conformation. 
Importantly, antibodies against three of the THPs that contain major CII 
epitopes were found to be increased in sera from patients with RA, compared to 
control persons. These results indicate that such synthetic THPs should be 
included in multiplex analysis of autoantibodies that are uniquely occurring in 
individuals with early RA, to provide valuable information on disease prognosis 
and on what type of therapy should be chosen for individual patients.

Introduction Adalimumab is used in the treatment of many chronic inflammatory 
diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this experimental study is 
to determine the histological and biochemical effects of adalimumab on rat 
ovary. Methods Wistar albino female rats were randomly divided into three groups 
prior to the experiment: a healthy control group, a 2 mg/kg adalimumab group, 
and a 5 mg/kg adalimumab group. Then, histopathological findings and biochemical 
examinations were made in the ovaries of the rats. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, 
morphometric examination, and Masson trichrome staining were performed. 
Antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels were measured in the biochemical examination. 
Results Ovarian follicle count and AMH level were significantly higher in the 
groups given low-dose adalimumab and high-dose adalimumab (p <0.001). In 
addition, fibrosis decreased in proportion to the dose of adalimumab (p <0.001). 
Conclusion Adalimumab is an important biological agent that contributes to the 
preservation of ovarian function by increasing ovarian follicle reserve and has 
shown that it can help preserve ovarian reserve in women of reproductive age 
suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that often causes progressive 
joint dysfunction, even disability and death in severe cases. The radical 
improvement of inflammatory cell infiltration and the resulting disorder in 
oxygen supply is a novel therapeutic direction for RA. Herein, a 
near-infrared-absorbing metal/semiconductor composite, polyethylene 
glycol-modified ceria-shell-coated gold nanorod (Au@CeO2), is fabricated for 
topical photothermal/oxygen-enriched combination therapy for RA in a mouse 
model. Upon laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of Au@CeO2 is 
exponentially enhanced by the localized surface plasma resonance-induced light 
focusing. The elevated temperature can not only remarkably obliterate 
hyperproliferative inflammatory cells gathered in diseased joints but also 
vastly increase the catalase-like activity of ceria to accelerate the 
decomposition of H2O2 to produce much oxygen, which relieves hypoxia. 
Significantly, RA-induced lesions are improved, and the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines and hypoxia-inducible factors is effectively repressed 
under the cooperation of heat and oxygen. Overall, the core/shell-structured 
Au@CeO2 is a promising nanotherapeutic platform that can well realize 
light-driven heat/oxygen enrichment to completely cure RA from the perspective 
of pathogenesis.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are classified into two groups, according to their side 
chain structures, as nitrogen-containing BPs (NBPs) and non-nitrogen-containing 
BPs (non-NBPs). In this study, we examined the effects of NBPs and non-NBPs on 
inflammatory responses, by quantifying the inflammatory mediators, prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO), in cultured neonatal mouse calvaria. All 
examined NBPs (pamidronate, alendronate, incadronate, risedronate, zoledronate) 
stimulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PGE2 and NO production by 
upregulating COX-2 and iNOS mRNA expression, whereas non-NBPs (etidronate, 
clodronate, tiludronate) suppressed PGE2 and NO production, by downregulating 
gene expression. Additionally, [4-(methylthio) phenylthio] methane 
bisphosphonate (MPMBP), a novel non-NBP with an antioxidant methylthio 
phenylthio group in its side chain, exhibited the most potent anti-inflammatory 
activity among non-NBPs. Furthermore, results of immunohistochemistry showed 
that the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 and tyrosine nitration of 
cytoplasmic protein were stimulated by zoledronate, while MPMBP inhibited these 
phenomena, by acting as a superoxide anion (O2-) scavenger. These findings 
indicate that MPMBP can act as an efficacious agent that causes fewer adverse 
effects in patients with inflammatory bone diseases, including periodontitis and 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is critical for host defense as well as the 
progression of inflammatory diseases through the production of the 
proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which is cleaved by active caspase-1. It has 
been reported that overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the 
development and pathology of acne vulgaris. Therefore, inhibiting activation of 
the NLRP3 inflammasome may provide a new therapeutic strategy for acne vulgaris. 
In this study, we investigated whether auranofin, an anti-rheumatoid arthritis 
agent, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby effectively treating 
acne vulgaris. Auranofin suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by 
Propionibacterium acnes, reducing the production of IL-1β in primary mouse 
macrophages and human sebocytes. In a P. acnes-induced acne mouse model, 
injection of P. acnes into the ears of mice induced acne symptoms such as 
redness, swelling, and neutrophil infiltration. Topical application of auranofin 
(0.5 or 1%) to mouse ears significantly reduced the inflammatory symptoms of 
acne vulgaris induced by P. acnes injection. Topical application of auranofin 
led to the downregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activated by P. acnes in 
mouse ear skin. These results show that auranofin inhibits the NLRP3 
inflammasome, the activation of which is associated with acne symptoms. The 
results further suggest that topical application of auranofin could be a new 
therapeutic strategy for treating acne vulgaris by targeting the NLRP3 
inflammasome.

OBJECTIVE: The dimeric artesunate phospholipid conjugate (Di-ART-GPC) is a novel 
amphipathic artemisinin derivative, which can be assembled into liposomes. 
Di-ART-GPC liposomes were prepared and evaluated as potential anti-inflammatory 
agents for rheumatic arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Di-ART-GPC was assembled into liposomes utilizing thin film 
dispersion-high pressure homogenization. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron cryo microscopy (cryo-EM) 
were employed to characterize the liposomal size and morphology. The in vitro 
cytotoxicity of the Di-ART-GPC liposomes was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 
(CCK8). The anti-inflammatory effects were studied utilizing the inflammatory 
cell model. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of the Di-ART-GPC-conjugated liposomes 
was investigated using the arthritis rat model.
RESULTS: The particle size of the Di-ART-GPC liposomes decreased to a narrow 
range of approximately 70 nm following high-pressure homogenization. The in 
vitro studies revealed low cytotoxicity and good anti-inflammatory effects of 
the Di-ART-GPC liposomes, which exhibited significantly higher inhibition of the 
cell secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines than ART. The in vivo evaluation 
confirmed that treatment with Di-ART-GPC resulted in a decline in the ankle 
swelling rate and a low inflammatory response compared with the model control 
and ART.
CONCLUSION: Di-ART-GPC liposomes demonstrate remarkable potential as novel 
ART-based anti-inflammatory agents for RA.

On-target, off-tissue toxicity limits the systemic use of drugs that would 
otherwise reduce symptoms or reverse the damage of arthritic diseases, leaving 
millions of patients in pain and with limited physical mobility. We identified 
cystine-dense peptides (CDPs) that rapidly accumulate in cartilage of the knees, 
ankles, hips, shoulders, and intervertebral discs after systemic administration. 
These CDPs could be used to concentrate arthritis drugs in joints. A 
cartilage-accumulating peptide, CDP-11R, reached peak concentration in cartilage 
within 30 min after administration and remained detectable for more than 4 days. 
Structural analysis of the peptides by crystallography revealed that the 
distribution of positive charge may be a distinguishing feature of 
joint-accumulating CDPs. In addition, quantitative whole-body autoradiography 
showed that the disulfide-bonded tertiary structure is critical for cartilage 
accumulation and retention. CDP-11R distributed to joints while carrying a 
fluorophore imaging agent or one of two different steroid payloads, 
dexamethasone (dex) and triamcinolone acetonide (TAA). Of the two payloads, the 
dex conjugate did not advance because the free drug released into circulation 
was sufficient to cause on-target toxicity. In contrast, the CDP-11R-TAA 
conjugate alleviated joint inflammation in the rat collagen-induced model of 
rheumatoid arthritis while avoiding toxicities that occurred with nontargeted 
steroid treatment at the same molar dose. This conjugate shows promise for 
clinical development and establishes proof of concept for multijoint targeting 
of disease-modifying therapeutic payloads.

The control of chronic inflammation is dependent on the possibility of limiting 
bystander activation of autoreactive and potentially pathogenic T cells. We have 
identified a non-sense loss of function single nucleotide polymorphism in the 
C-type lectin receptor, Clec4b, and have shown that it controls chronic 
autoimmune arthritis in rat models of rheumatoid arthritis. Clec4b is 
specifically expressed in CD4+ myeloid cells, mainly classical dendritic cells 
(DCs), and is defined by the markers CD4+/MHCIIhi/CD11b/c+. We found that Clec4b 
limited the activation of arthritogenic CD4+αβT cells and the absence of Clec4b 
allowed development of arthritis already 5 days after adjuvant injection. Clec4b 
sufficient CD4+ myeloid dendritic cells successfully limited the arthritogenic T 
cell expansion immediately after activation both in vitro and in vivo. We 
conclude that Clec4b expressed on CD4+ myeloid dendritic cells regulate the 
expansion of auto-reactive and potentially pathogenic T cells during an immune 
response, demonstrating an early checkpoint control mechanism to avoid 
autoimmunity leading to chronic inflammation.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a disabling autoimmune disease with a high global 
prevalence. Treatment with disease-modifying anti-arthritic drugs (DIMARDs) has 
been routinely used with beneficial effects but with adverse long-term 
consequences; novel targeted biologics and small-molecule inhibitors are 
promising options. In this study, we investigated whether purified omega 
unsaturated fatty acids (ω-UFAs) and dialysable leukocyte extracts (DLEs) 
prevented the development of arthritis in a model of collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) in mice. We also investigated whether the transcription factor NF-κB and 
the NLRP3 inflammasome were involved in the process and whether their activity 
was modulated by treatment. The development of arthritis was evaluated for 84 
days following treatment with nothing, dexamethasone, DLEs, docosahexaenoic 
acid, arachidonic acid, and oleic acid. Progression of CIA was monitored by 
evaluating clinical manifestations, inflammatory changes, and histological 
alterations in the pads' articular tissues. Both DLEs and ω-UFAs led to an 
almost complete inhibition of the inflammatory histopathology of CIA and this 
was concomitant with the inhibition of NF-kB and the inhibition of the 
activation of NLRP3. These data suggest that ω-UFAs and DLEs might have NF-κB as 
a common target and that they might be used as ancillary medicines in the 
treatment of arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: In RA, synovial fibroblasts become activated. These cells express 
fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and contribute to the pathogenesis by 
producing cytokines, chemokines and proteases. Selective depletion in inflamed 
joints could therefore constitute a viable treatment option. To this end, we 
developed and tested a new therapeutic strategy based on the selective 
destruction of FAP-positive cells by targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT) using 
the anti-FAP antibody 28H1 coupled to the photosensitizer IRDye700DX.
METHODS: After conjugation of IRDye700DX to 28H1, the immunoreactive binding and 
specificity of the conjugate were determined. Subsequently, tPDT efficiency was 
established in vitro using a 3T3 cell line stably transfected with FAP. The 
biodistribution of [111In]In-DTPA-28H1 with and without IRDye700DX was assessed 
in healthy C57BL/6N mice and in C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis. 
The potential of FAP-tPDT to induce targeted damage was determined ex vivo by 
treating knee joints from C57BL/6N mice with antigen-induced arthritis 24 h 
after injection of the conjugate. Finally, the effect of FAP-tPDT on arthritis 
development was determined in mice with collagen-induced arthritis.
RESULTS: 28H1-700DX was able to efficiently induce FAP-specific cell death in 
vitro. Accumulation of the anti-FAP antibody in arthritic knee joints was not 
affected by conjugation with the photosensitizer. Arthritis development was 
moderately delayed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis after FAP-tPDT.
CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tPDT to selectively target 
and kill FAP-positive fibroblasts in vitro and modulate arthritis in vivo using 
a mouse model of RA. This approach may have therapeutic potential in 
(refractory) arthritis.

Crotonoside, a guanosine analog originally isolated from Croton tiglium, is 
reported to be a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor with immunosuppressive effects 
on immune cells. Due to its potential immunotherapeutic effects, we aimed to 
evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of crotonoside and explore its 
immunomodulatory properties in alleviating the severity of arthritic symptoms. 
To this end, we implemented the treatment of crotonoside on collagen-induced 
arthritic (CIA) DBA/1 mice and investigated its underlying mechanisms towards 
pathogenic dendritic cells (DCs). Our results suggest that crotonoside treatment 
remarkably improved clinical arthritic symptoms in this CIA mouse model as 
indicated by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the serum and 
suppressed expression of co-stimulatory molecules, CD40, CD80, and MHC class II, 
on CD11c+ DCs from the CIA mouse spleens. Additionally, crotonoside treatment 
significantly reduced the infiltration of CD11c+ DCs into the synovial tissues. 
Our in vitro study further demonstrated that bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) 
exhibited lower yield in numbers and expressed lower levels of CD40, CD80, and 
MHC-II when incubated with crotonoside. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated mature DCs 
exhibited limited capability to prime antigen-specific CD4+ and T-cell 
proliferation, cytokine secretions, and co-stimulatory molecule expressions when 
treated with crotonoside. Our pioneer study highlights the immunotherapeutic 
role of crotonoside in the alleviation of the CIA via modulation of pathogenic 
DCs, thus creating possible applications of crotonoside as an immunosuppressive 
agent that could be utilized and further explored in treating autoimmune 
disorders in the future.

The study examined germinal centre (GC) reaction in lymph nodes draining 
inflamed joints and adjacent tissues (dLNs) in male and female Dark Agouti rat 
collagen type II (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) model of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Female rats exhibiting the greater susceptibility to CIA mounted stronger serum 
CII-specific IgG response than their male counterparts. This correlated with the 
higher frequency of GC B cells in female compared with male dLNs. Consistently, 
the frequency of activated/proliferating Ki-67+ cells among dLN B cells was 
higher in females than in males. This correlated with the shift in dLN T 
follicular regulatory (Tfr)/T follicular helper (Tfh) cell ratio towards Tfh 
cells in females, and greater densities of CD40L and CD40 on their dLN T and B 
cells, respectively. The higher Tfh cell frequency in females was consistent 
with the greater dLN expression of mRNA for IL-21/27, the key cytokines involved 
in Tfh cell generation and their help to B cells. Additionally, in 
CII-stimulated female rat dLN cell cultures IFN-γ/IL-4 production ratio was 
shifted towards IFN-γ. Consistently, the serum IgG2a(b)/IgG1 CII-specific 
antibody ratio was shifted towards an IgG2a(b) response in females. Thus, 
targeting T-/B-cell interactions should be considered in putative further 
sex-based translational pharmacology research.

Given the physically encapsulated payloads with drug burst release and/or low 
drug loading, it is critical to initiate an innovative prodrug strategy to 
optimize the design of modular nanomedicines. Here, we designed modular 
pH-sensitive acetone-based ketal-linked prodrugs of dexamethasone (AKP-dexs) and 
formulated them as nanoparticles. We comprehensively studied the relationships 
between AKP-dex structure and properties, and we selected two types of 
AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles for in vivo studies on the basis of their size, 
drug loading, and colloidal stability. In a collagen-induced arthritis rat 
model, these AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles showed higher accumulation in inflamed 
joints and better therapeutic efficacy than free dexamethasone phosphate with 
less-severe side effects. AKP-dex-loaded nanoparticles may be useful for 
treating other inflammatory diseases and thus have great translational 
potential. Our findings represent an important step toward the development of 
practical applications for acetone-based ketal-linked prodrugs and are useful in 
the design of modular nanomedicines.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGIAL RELEVANCE: Although Damsissa (Ambrosia maritima) is 
traditionally used as anti-inflammatory and diuretic, the biological activity 
and mechanism of action of its major constituents are to be elucidated.
AIM: to decipher the anti-arthritic potential of damsin (DMS) and neoambrosin 
(NMS) and to unfold their molecular signaling in complete Freund's adjuvant 
(CFA)-induced arthritis model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: the right hind paw was inoculated with CFA (0.1 ml) at 
day 0 and 7 while treatments were started from the 14th day and continued for 2 
weeks. Rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups; normal group (NRML), 
CFA-induced arthritis group, CFA-induced arthritis treated with DMS and NMS 
(10 mg/kg/day) as 3rd and 4th group; respectively.
RESULTS: Throughout experimental period, treatments ameliorated the increase of 
paw volume, knee joint diameter and nociception tests as reflected in open field 
arena. Also, DSM and NMS suppressed phosphorylation of Akt, STAT-3, ERK1/2 which 
was further mirrored by inactivation of GSK3β and downregulation of MCP-1 
together with CCN1 and NF-kβ in hind paw tissue. Concomitantly, inflammation 
markers; TNF-α, IL-6, -12 were lowered as confirmed microscopically during 
examination of hind paw tissue.
CONCLUSION: DSM and NMS-induced suppression of NF-kβ subdues clinical features 
of RA most probably through repression of Akt/ERK1/2/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, 
DMS and NMS can serve as safe and effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, 
one of the most disabling chronic, inflammatory and painful autoimmune disease.

BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is rapidly upregulated by 
inflammation, is a key enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the synthesis 
of several inflammatory prostanoids. Successful positron emission tomography 
(PET) radioligand imaging of COX-2 in vivo could be a potentially powerful tool 
for assessing inflammatory response in the brain and periphery. To date, 
however, the development of PET radioligands for COX-2 has had limited success.
METHODS: The novel PET tracer [11C]MC1 was used to examine COX-2 expression [1] 
in the brains of four rhesus macaques at baseline and after injection of the 
inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the right putamen, and [2] in the 
joints of two human participants with rheumatoid arthritis and two healthy 
individuals. In the primate study, two monkeys had one LPS injection, and two 
monkeys had a second injection 33 and 44 days, respectively, after the first LPS 
injection. As a comparator, COX-1 expression was measured using [11C]PS13.
RESULTS: COX-2 binding, expressed as the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable 
uptake (BPND) of [11C]MC1, increased on day 1 post-LPS injection; no such 
increase in COX-1 expression, measured using [11C]PS13, was observed. The day 
after the second LPS injection, a brain lesion (~ 0.5 cm in diameter) with high 
COX-2 density and high BPND (1.8) was observed. Postmortem brain analysis at the 
gene transcript or protein level confirmed in vivo PET results. An incidental 
finding in an unrelated monkey found a line of COX-2 positivity along an 
incision in skull muscle, demonstrating that [11C]MC1 can localize inflammation 
peripheral to the brain. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, [11C]MC1 
successfully imaged upregulated COX-2 in the arthritic hand and shoulder and 
apparently in the brain. Uptake was blocked by celecoxib, a COX-2 preferential 
inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that [11C]MC1 can image and 
quantify COX-2 upregulation in both monkey brain after LPS-induced 
neuroinflammation and in human peripheral tissue with inflammation.

Tofacitinib is a Jak inhibitor developed as a treatment for rheumatoid 
arthritis. Tofacitinib is metabolized mainly through hepatic CYP3A1/2, followed 
by CYP2C11. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to increase renal toxicity due to drugs 
used for long-term treatment. In this study, pharmacokinetic changes of 
tofacitinib were evaluated in rats with gentamicin (G-ARF) and cisplatin-induced 
acute renal failure (C-ARF). The time-averaged total body clearance (CL) of 
tofacitinib in G-ARF and C-ARF rats after 1-min intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg 
was significantly decreased by 37.7 and 62.3%, respectively, compared to in 
control rats. This seems to be because the time-averaged renal clearance (CLR) 
was significantly lower by 69.5 and 98.6%, respectively, due to decreased 
creatinine clearance (CLCR). In addition, the time-averaged nonrenal clearance 
(CLNR) was also significantly lower by 33.2 and 57.4%, respectively, due to 
reduction in the hepatic CYP3A1/2 and CYP2C11 subfamily in G-ARF and C-ARF rats. 
After oral administration of tofacitinib (20 mg/kg) to G-ARF and C-ARF rats, 
both CLR and CLNR were also significantly decreased. In conclusion, an increase 
in area under plasma concentration-time curves from time zero to time infinity 
(AUC) of tofacitinib in G-ARF and C-ARF rats was due to the significantly slower 
elimination of tofacitinib contributed by slower hepatic metabolism and urinary 
excretion of the drug.

The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear, and it is 
currently believed that an imbalance in regulatory T (Treg) cells/T helper 17 
cells (Th17 cells) is related to the occurrence and development of IBD. 
Recently, the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 has been used in animal models such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and bronchial asthma models and shown to exert 
immunoregulatory functions that improve disorder in the Treg/Th17 cell balance. 
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of AG490 on the intestinal inflammatory 
process in an IBD rat model. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD rat 
model was established, and disease activity index (DAI) scores were calculated. 
The histopathological damage score was determined by haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) 
staining. Treg/Th17 cells in the spleen were detected by flow cytometry. The 
levels of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6 and IL-17A were detected by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AG490 attenuated DSS-induced IBD injury by 
regulating the Treg/Th17 balance and related cytokine secretion to reduce the 
DAI and colonic tissue damage. Thus, AG490 may be a new method for effective 
treatment of IBD.

Porcine pleuropneumonia caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is a 
swine respiratory disease with an important impact around the world either as a 
single infection or part of the porcine respiratory disease complex. The data of 
interaction between hosts and pathogens has becoming more crucial for 
exploration of the mechanism. However, up to now, comparatively little 
information is available on the systemic and dynamic changes that occur in pig 
serum in response to APP infection. This study used iTRAQ to identify 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in pig serum in response to APP 
infection. Compared with the APP un-infected group (S0),there were 137 
up-regulated and 68 down-regulated proteins at 24 h (S24), and 81 up-regulated 
and 107 down-regulated proteins at 120 h (S120). At 24 h, the immune response 
was not significantly enriched, but cell adhesion, cytosol, Golgi apparatus, GTP 
and ATP binding and regulation of cell cycle were extremely active, implying 
host preparation of immune response starting. Subsequently, innate immune 
response, negative regulation of apoptotic process, immunological synapse, 
adaptive immune response, the regulation of inflammatory response, positive 
regulation of T cell proliferation were more enhanced at 120 h then that of 
24 h, representing innate immunity transferring to the adaptive, while 
endocytosis, cell adhesion and platelet aggregation showed obvious decline. The 
pathways of T cell receptor signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, leukocyte transendothelial 
migration were active remarkably during all infection period, and more pathways 
could connect to form innate immune defense networks. Surprisingly, the pathways 
like amoebiasis, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria had been found up-regulated. 
As a conclusion, APP could delay host inflammatory response to the infection at 
early stage, and induced innate immunity to convert from adhesion, interaction 
into complement activation, proteasome digestion, bacterial invasion at later 
stage. This would increase our understanding of the porcine distinct response to 
APP infection.

Hyperosmolarity is pro-inflammatory stress to the ocular surface epithelium 
associated with dry eye disease (DED). Astaxanthin (AST) is a kind of carotene, 
which exists in seafood and plays important roles in the amelioration of 
inflammatory diseases like arteriosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, gastric inflammation, brain inflammatory diseases. The aim 
of this study was to characterize the protective effect and potential mechanism 
of AST on DED in vitro and in vivo. Mouse models and human corneal epithelial 
cell (HCEC) cultures were exposed to hyperosmotic saline solution (HOSS) in in 
vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively. Experimental subjects were first 
pretreated with AST, and then the effect of the compound was assessed with 
clinical evaluation, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), western blot and immunofluorescent 
staining. We further investigated the possible mechanism of AST in DED by 
pre-treating with phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). The addition 
of AST significantly reduced the expression of High-mobility group box 1 
(HMGB1), as well as significantly inhibited the increases of TNF-α, IL-1β in a 
dose-dependent manner, but promoted the expression of phospho-Akt (p-Akt). 
BALB/c mice in DE group pretreated with AST showed significantly decreased 
corneal fluorescein staining scores. Moreover, pretreatment with LY294002 could 
eliminate the effects of AST preconditioning on the decrease of HMGB1. Our study 
provides evidence that AST could ameliorate DED which may be related to the 
inhibition of HMGB1, TNF-α, IL-1β, while PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be 
involved in the expression of HMGB1 and the protective effect of AST 
preconditioning.

Activated macrophages are the primary targets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
management. So, we report efficacious, dual-functional Methotrexate (MTX) loaded 
folate-conjugated pH-responsive glycol-chitosan nanoparticles (MFGCN) prepared 
by nano-precipitation and zero-order cross-linking reaction for targeting 
inflamed arthritic tissue. Physical characterization by DLS, SEM and TEM 
indicated a spherical, smooth morphology with a diameter ~ 300 nm. 1H NMR and 
FTIR indicated folic acid conjugation to GC by zero-order cross-linkers. In 
vitro release kinetics in PBS showed pH-responsive and sustained release 
behaviour of MFGCN. Enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of MFGCN in 
LPS(+)RAW and activated peritoneal macrophages (Mϕ) were observed when compared 
to LPS(-)RAW cells. MFGCN-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) 
perturbations indicated apoptosis. Oxidative stress was evident by significant 
increase in ROS and RNS, 4 h post incubation with MFGCN. Negligible hemolysis by 
FGCN and MFGCN on rat RBC's indicated biocompatibility. In vivo biodistribution 
of MFGCN in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats indicated RA targetability. 
Prolonged blood circulation coupled with higher concentrations of 99mTc-MFGCN at 
the arthritic site was observed post 24 h of injection. The gamma scintigraphic 
image confirmed accumulation of radiolabelled MFGCN in arthritic paw when 
compared to the non-inflamed paw, confirming the selective uptake of 99mTc-MFGCN 
by folate-overexpressing macrophages in the arthritic synovium thereby proving 
its targeted efficacy and theranostic potential. In AIA rats, MFGCN lowers 
arthritic signs, improves antioxidant response and decreases pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, suggesting its potential in targeting activated macrophages of 
synovium. Graphical abstract.

Colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R) is a receptor 
protein-tyrosine kinase specifically expressed in monocyte-lineage cells, such 
as monocytes and macrophages. In this study, we characterized the 
pharmacological properties of an azetidine compound, JTE-952 
((2S)-3-{[2-({3-[4-(4-cyclopropylbenzyloxy)-3-methoxyphenyl]azetidine-1-yl}carbonyl)pyridin-4-yl]methoxy}propane-1,2-diol), 
which is a novel CSF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor. JTE-952 potently inhibited 
human CSF1R kinase activity, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 
11.1 nmol/L, and inhibited the phosphorylation of CSF1R in human macrophages and 
the CSF1-induced proliferation of human macrophages. It also inhibited human 
tropomyosin-related kinase A activity, but only at concentrations 200-fold 
higher than that required to inhibit the activity of CSF1R in inducing the 
proliferation of human macrophages. JTE-952 displayed no marked inhibitory 
activity against other kinases. JTE-952 potently inhibited 
lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human 
macrophages and in whole blood. JTE-952 (≥3 mg/kg given orally) also 
significantly attenuated the CSF1-induced priming of lipopolysaccharide-induced 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in mice and arthritis severity in a mouse 
model of collagen-induced arthritis. Taken together, these results indicate that 
JTE-952 is an orally available compound with potent and specific inhibitory 
activity against CSF1R, both in vitro and in vivo. JTE-952 is a potentially 
clinically useful agent for various human inflammatory diseases, including 
rheumatoid arthritis.

The pyroptosis is a causative agent of rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic 
autoimmune disease merged with degenerative articular cartilage. Nevertheless, 
the precise mechanism of extracellular acidosis on chondrocyte pyroptosis is 
largely unclear. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) belong to an extracellular H+ 
-activated cation channel family. Accumulating evidence has highlighted 
activation of ASICs induced by extracellular acidosis upregulate calpain and 
calcineurin expression in arthritis. In the present study, to investigate the 
expression and the role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), calpain, 
calcineurin, and NLRP3 inflammasome proteins in regulating acid-induced 
articular chondrocyte pyroptosis, primary rat articular chondrocytes were 
subjected to different pH, different time, and different treatments with or 
without ASIC1a, calpain-2, and calcineurin, respectively. Initially, the 
research results showed that extracellular acidosis-induced the protein 
expression of ASIC1a in a pH- and time-dependent manner, and the messenger RNA 
and protein expressions of calpain, calcineurin, NLRP3, apoptosis-associated 
speck-like protein, and caspase-1 were significantly increased in a 
time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the inhibition of ASIC1a, calpain-2, or 
calcineurin, respectively, could decrease the cell death accompanied with the 
decreased interleukin-1β level, and the decreased expression of ASIC1a, 
calpain-2, calcineurin, and NLRP3 inflammasome proteins. Taken together, these 
results indicated the activation of ASIC1a induced by extracellular acidosis 
could trigger pyroptosis of rat articular chondrocytes, the mechanism of which 
might partly be involved with the activation of calpain-2/calcineurin pathway.

Chronic and excessive inflammation can destroy host organs and cause 
inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and rheumatoid 
arthritis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of 
Alpinia katsumadai seed-derived 
2,3,5,22,23-pentahydroxy-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-tetracosa-6,10,14,18-tetraene 
(PHT) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated J774 cells and a 
formalin-induced chronic paw inflammation mouse model. The in vitro results 
showed that PHT exhibited no cytotoxicity and decreased LPS-induced NO 
secretion. Additionally, PHT inhibited LPS-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) 
and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) protein expression. The quantitative real-time PCR 
results showed that PHT downregulated the gene expression of the proinflammatory 
cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α). PHT inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of 
activated B cells (NF-κB). In a mouse model, oral administration of 50 mg/kg PHT 
significantly alleviated both mouse paw thickness and volume. These results 
indicate that PHT has potential anti-inflammatory effects and should be 
considered a possible functional material.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common type of autoimmune arthritis. 
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) as a transcription factor in response to 
hypoxia suggests that it could be a potential therapeutic target for the 
treatment of RA. In this study, we assessed whether the HIF pathway blockade 
attenuates the manifestations of RA in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat 
model. We constructed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral expression vector 
targeting HIF-1α (pLVX-shRNA-HIF-1α) and to achieve HIF-1α RNA interference. 
Quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot were used to 
detect the expressions of HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
phsopho (p)-p65, and p-IКBɑ mRNA and protein, respectively. Micro-computed 
tomography was used to investigate joint morphology at different time points 
after CIA induction. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was 
used to monitor the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vitro analyses 
revealed that pLVX-shRNA-HIF-1α effectively inhibited the expression of HIF-1α 
and VEGF and led to the activation of p-65 and p-IКBɑ, as well as decreased 
proinflammatory cytokine expression in cell culture. Inhibition of HIF-1α in 
rats decreased signs of a systemic inflammatory condition, together with 
decreased pathological changes of RA. Moreover, downregulation of HIF-1α 
expression markedly reduced the synovitis and angiogenesis. In conclusion, we 
have shown that pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1 may improve the clinical 
manifestations of RA.

Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely used animal model for studying 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which manifests serious joint dysfunction, 
progressive bone erosion and articular cartilage destruction. Considering that 
joint damage in RA is caused by systemic inflammation and dihydromyricetin 
(DMY), the main flavonoid of Ampelopsis Michx, possesses anti-inflammatory 
properties, in the present study we have investigated the potential capability 
of DMY to inhibit inflammation-mediated joint damage and explore the underlying 
mechanisms. A rat model of RA induced by CIA was administered with DMY for 5 
weeks. Prior to histological analysis, the knee joints were scanned by 
microcomputed tomography (μCT) to detect bone damage. Articular cartilage 
destruction was assessed by Alcian blue and Toluidine blue staining and the 
pathological alteration of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in joints was evaluated 
by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 
staining, respectively. The effects of DMY on osteoblast differentiation and 
osteoclast formation in vitro were investigated. Consistent with the in vivo 
results, DMY had no significant effect on osteoblast differentiation but an 
inhibitory effect on osteoclast formation. Furthermore, we determined that the 
mechanism of the DMY-suppressed osteoclast formation was blocking the 
phosphorylation of I-κB kinase (IKK) so as to hinder the activation of nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB). Collectively, DMY could ameliorate knee joint damage, 
especially in articular cartilage, which is the weight-bearing region, by 
inhibiting osteoclast formation through NF-κB signaling.

Emerging evidence has pointed out the importance of long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) in multiple diseases, the knowledge of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA)-associated lncRNAs remains limited. In this present study, we aimed to 
elucidate the mechanism of lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 
(NEAT1) from peripheral blood monouclear cell (PBMC)-derived exosomes (exos) on 
RA development by modulating the microRNA-23a (miR-23a)/murine double minute-2 
(MDM2)/Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) axis. RA was modeled in vivo by collagen induction in 
mice and in vitro by exposing fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) to 
lipopolysaccharide. Exos were isolated from human or mouse PBMCs, which were 
then were co-cultured with FLSs. Based on gain- and loss-of-function 
experiments, the cell proliferation and secretion of inflammatory factors were 
measured. LncRNA NEAT1 was found to be highly expressed in RA, and PBMCs-derived 
exos contributed to RA development by delivering lncRNA NEAT1. In 
lipopolysaccharide-induced FLSs, miR-23a inhibited the expression of MDM2, and 
overexpression of MDM2 partially rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-23a on FLS 
proliferation and inflammatory response. Mechanistically, MDM2 ubiquitination 
degraded SIRT6 in RA. LncRNA NEAT1 shuttled by PBMC-derived exos promoted FLS 
proliferation and inflammation through regulating the MDM2/SIRT6 axis. 
Furthermore, in vivo experiments suggested that downregulated lncRNA NEAT1 
shuttled by PBMC-derived exos or upregulated miR-23a impeded RA deterioration in 
mice. This study highlights that lncRNA NEAT1 shuttled by PBMC-derived exos 
contributes to RA development with the involvement of the miR-23a/MDM2/SIRT6 
axis.

OBJECTIVE: Functioning is an important outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
management. Heterogeneity of respective patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) challenges direct comparisons between their results. This study aimed to 
standardize reporting of such PROMs measuring functioning in RA to facilitate 
comparability.
METHODS: Common Item Non-Equivalent Groups Design (NEAT) with the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) as a common scale across data sets from various 
countries (incl. UK, Turkey and Germany) to establish a common metric. Other 
PROMs included are the Physical Function items of the Multidimensional Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ), Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), World 
Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule Version 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), and 
four short forms (20, 10, 6, and 4 physical function items) from the 
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). As the HAQ 
includes mobility, self-care and domestic life items, this study focuses on 
these three domains. PROMs were described using Standard Error of Measurement 
(SEM) and Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD). Rasch Measurement model was used 
to create the common metric.
RESULTS: Range of SEM is 0.2 (MDHAQ) to 7.4 (SF36-PF). SDD revealed a range from 
9.7 % (WOMAC-RAT) to 33.5 % (WHODAS-PF). PROMs co-calibration revealed fit to 
the Rasch measurement model. A transformation table was developed to allow 
exchange between PROMs scores.
DISCUSSION: Scores between the Daily Activity PROMs commonly used in RA can now 
be compared. Factors such as SEM and SDD help determine choice of PROM in 
clinical practice and research.

The currently used anti-cytokine therapeutic antibodies cannot selectively 
neutralize pathogenic cytokine signaling that cause collateral damage to 
protective signaling cascades carrying the potential for unwanted side effects. 
The variable domains of heavy-chain only antibodies (HCAbs) discovered in 
Camelidae are stable and display to be fully functional in antigen-binding 
against variable targets, which seem to be attractive candidates for the 
next-generation biologic drug study. The purpose of our study was to establish a 
simple prokaryotic expression system for large-scale expression, purification, 
and refolding of the recombinant anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) fusion 
protein (FVH1-1) from inclusion bodies. Over 95% purity of the recombinant 
anti-TNF-α fusion proteins was obtained by just one purification step in our 
developed prokaryotic expression system, while the results of surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) established the high-efficiency potent binding ability of FVH1-1 
to human TNF-α. The counteraction of TNF-α cytotoxic effect experiment on the 
mouse fibroblast fibrosarcoma cell line (L929) confirmed that the expressed 
FVH1-1 were able to selectively and highly combine with human recombinant TNF-α 
(hTNF-α) in vitro. Western blot results showed that FVH1-1 can inhibit the 
activation of caspase-9 and PARP, which are the apoptotic signaling pathway 
proteins activated by hTNF-α. Meanwhile, lysosome autophagy signaling pathways 
stimulated by hTNF-α were inhibited by FVH1-1, which down-regulated the 
expression of LC3II/LC3I and up-regulated the expression of P62, indicating that 
the autophagy linked with TNF-α-induced apoptosis in response to rheumatoid 
arthritis. The results of the AIA rat model experiment presented that FVH1-1 can 
reduce the degree of joint swelling and inflammatory factors to a certain extent 
in vivo.

The main aim of the current research was to develop a modified cyclodextrin 
based nanoparticulate drug delivery system to deliver dexamethasone sodium 
phosphate (DSP) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DSP is a 
glucocorticoid (GC), and its limited application in RA therapy due to poor 
pharmacokinetics and its severe associated side effects. DSP loaded 
hydrophobically modified cyclodextrin based nanoparticles (DSP-NPs) prepared by 
a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The nanoparticle size was <120 nm, 
good entrapment efficiency and excellent stability were obtained. TEM study 
showed that nanoparticles were perfectly spherical shape. The in-vitro drug 
release from nanoparticle follows the non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. The 
pharmacokinetic profile of DSP after encapsulation showing the 2.3-fold increase 
in AUC and extended mean residence time, which increases the chances of 
nanoparticles to extravasate into the site of inflammation by the EPR effect. 
The pharmacodynamic studies in the Adjuvant-induced Arthritis (AIA) rat model 
showing a significant reduction in arthritic score, paw thickness, and 
inflammatory cytokine level in serum. Adverse effects evaluation studies 
demonstrate a significant reduction in the associated undesirable effects on 
body weight, blood glucose level, renal impairment, and hematological 
abnormalities compared to marketed formulation. These results suggest that 
DSP-NPs can be used as an efficient therapy for RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized 
by chronic synovitis, bone erosion, and bone loss. Erzhi Pill (EZP), a classic 
Chinese patent medicine, is often used to treat osteoporosis and shows a 
capacity for bone metabolism regulation. Methotrexate (MTX), an essential drug 
for RA treatment, has been reported to inhibit generalized bone loss in RA 
patients. However, the combined therapeutic effects and mechanism of EZP and MTX 
in RA have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the synergistic effect of EZP and MTX on RA and to explore the underlying 
mechanism through network pharmacological prediction and experimental 
verification. Chemical compounds of EZP, human target proteins of EZP and MTX, 
and RA-related human genes were identified in the Encyclopedia of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine database, PubChem database, and NCBI database, respectively. 
The molecular network of EZP and MTX in RA was generated and analyzed with 
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software according to the datasets. Then, MTX 
monotherapy, EZP monotherapy, and combined MTX and EZP therapy were administered 
to collagen-induced arthritis rats, followed by assessment of pathological 
score, bone damage, bone alkaline phosphatases (BALP), and tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase (TRACP), and of gene levels related to the Wnt1/LRP5/β-catenin 
pathway according to network pharmacological analysis. Finally, serum samples 
from MTX-, EZP- and MTX+EZP-treated rats were used to treat the rat osteoblast 
(OB)-like UMR-106 cell line to evaluate gene levels related to 
Wnt1/LRP5/β-catenin. Network pharmacological analysis showed that the 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was the top signaling pathway shared among MTX, 
EZP, and RA. The results from in vivo experiments indicated that EZP combined 
with MTX reduced arthritis severity, alleviated ankle bone damage, increased 
BALP and decreased TRACP serum levels, and regulated the mRNA expression of 
Wnt1, LRP5, β-catenin, Runx2, BALP, and BGP in the ankles. In vitro experiments 
showed that EZP combined with MTX could also improve the expression of genes 
related to the Wnt1/LRP5/β-catenin pathway. This study demonstrated that EZP in 
combination with MTX played a synergistic role in regulating OBs in RA, which 
was connected to the modulatory effect of EZP and MTX on the Wnt1/LRP5/β-catenin 
signaling pathway.

The chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is 
characterized by an infiltration of activated proinflammatory immune cells into 
the joint that is accompanied by an overproduction of various mediators, leading 
to destruction of cartilage and bone erosion. Angiotensin II type 2 receptor 
(AT2R) is involved in antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic 
responses. Synovial macrophages (SMs) are a type of tissue macrophages that are 
derived from bone marrow cells. SMs plays a central role in synovial regional 
immunization, which is significantly increased in both collagen-induced mice 
with arthritis mice and RA patients. AT2R activation caused a reversal of the 
polarization of SMs in the joint from the proinflammatory M1 SM to the 
tolerogenic, benign M2 SM. In consequence, this switch resulted in an attenuated 
form of the joint pathology in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. These 
results were mechanistically linked to the observation that GRK2 was 
translocated into cytoplasm, and ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation were inhibited. 
These findings open the way to a new therapeutic approach using an activation of 
AT2R to subvert joint inflammation in RA.

Filgotinib is a selective JAK1 (Janus kinase) inhibitor, filed in Japan for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In this paper, we report a validated liquid 
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of 
filgotinib in rat plasma using tofacitinib as an internal standard (IS) as per 
the Food and Drug Administration regulatory guidelines. Filgotinib and the IS 
were extracted from rat plasma using ethyl acetate as an extraction solvent and 
chromatographed using an isocratic mobile phase (0.2% formic acid:acetonitrile; 
20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min on a Gemini C18 column. Filgotinib and 
the IS were eluted at ~1.31 and 0.89 min, respectively. The MS/MS ion 
transitions monitored were m/z 426.3 → 291.3 and m/z 313.2 → 149.2 for 
filgotinib and the IS, respectively. The calibration range was 0.78-1924 ng/mL. 
No matrix effect and carryover were observed. Intra- and inter-day accuracies 
and precisions were within the acceptance range. Filgotinib was stable for three 
freeze-thaw cycles: on bench-top up to 6 h, in an autosampler up to 21 h, and at 
-80°C for 1 month. This novel method has been applied to a pharmacokinetic study 
in rats.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Neuropathological 
processes, including the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation, lead to cognitive impairment at 
middle and eventually later stages of AD progression. Over the last decade, 
focused efforts have explored repurposed drug approaches for AD 
pathophysiological mechanisms. Recently, auranofin, an anti-inflammatory drug, 
was shown to have therapeutic potential in a number of diseases in addition to 
rheumatoid arthritis. Surprisingly, no data regarding the effects of auranofin 
on cognitive deficits in AD mice or the influence of auranofin on Aβ pathology 
and neuroinflammatory processes are available. In the present study, we used 
14-month-old transgenic male APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice to assess the effects of 
subchronic administration of auranofin at low doses (1 and 5 mg/kg, 
intraperitoneal) on spatial memory, Aβ pathology and the expression of cortical 
and hippocampal proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized 
calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1)) and proteins related to synaptic 
plasticity (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), homer proteins homologue-1 
(Homer-1)). The data demonstrated that auranofin significantly decreased Aβ 
deposition in the hippocampus and the number of Aβ plaques in the cingulate 
cortex, but it did not have memory-enhancing effects or induce changes in the 
expression of the studied proteins. Our current results highlight the importance 
of considering further pre-clinical research to investigate the possible 
beneficial effects of auranofin on the other pathological aspects of AD.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is among the most prevalent forms of autoimmunity. 
Gentiopicroside (Gent) is an iridoid glucoside derived from the Gentiana 
Macrophylla Pall which is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat RA. The 
present study was designed to explore the ability of Gent to combat RA and to 
explore the molecular basis for such anti-RA activity both in vitro using tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-stimulated human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(RA-FLS) and in vivo using a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. We 
found that Gent was able to significantly reduce the swelling of joints and 
arthritic index scores, with corresponding reductions in synovial inflammatory 
cell infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, and bone erosion in treated AIA rats. 
Importantly, Gent 200 mg/kg reduced thymus index in AIA rats, but had no effect 
on spleen index and body weight, it revealed that Gent was relatively safe at 
the dose we chose. We further found that Gent was able to suppress the 
TNF-α-induced proliferation and migration of RA-FLS cells. This suppression was 
attributed to the ability of Gent to block NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1, 
thereby disrupting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Consistent with 
such suppression, Gent led to a significant decrease in IL-1β secretion by 
treated cells. Furthermore, this reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome activation was 
also associated with decreases in the activation of nuclear factor (NF-κB), the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of inflammatory 
IL-6. Together these findings indicate that Gent can suppress the 
ROS-NF-κB-NLRP3 axis to alleviate RA symptoms.

CD28 expression is generally considered to be T lymphocyte specific. We have 
previously shown CD28 mRNA expression in M-CSF-dependent anti-inflammatory 
monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ), and now demonstrate that CD28 cell surface 
expression is higher in M-MØ than in GM-CSF-dependent macrophages, and that 
macrophage CD28 expression is regulated by MAFB and activin A. In vivo, CD28 was 
found in tumor-associated macrophages and, to a lower extent, in 
pro-inflammatory synovial fluid macrophages from rheumatoid arthritis patients. 
Analysis of mouse macrophages confirmed Cd28 expression in bone-marrow derived 
M-MØ. Indeed, anti-CD28 antibodies triggered ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mouse 
M-MØ. At the functional level, Cd28KO M-MØ exhibited a significantly higher 
capacity to activate the OVA-specific proliferation of OT-II CD4+ T cells than 
WT M-MØ, as well as enhanced LPS-induced IL-6 production. Besides, the Cd28KO 
M-MØ transcriptome was significantly different from WT M-MØ regarding the 
expression IFN response, inflammatory response, and TGF-β signaling related gene 
sets. Therefore, defective CD28 expression in mouse macrophages associates to 
changes in gene expression profile, what might contribute to the altered 
functionality displayed by Cd28KO M-MØ. Thus, CD28 expression appears as a 
hallmark of anti-inflammatory macrophages and might be a target for 
immunotherapy.

Excessive activity of osteoclasts causes many bone-related diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Agrimophol (AGR), a phenolic compound, 
originated from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. In prior studies, AGR is reported to 
possess schistosomicidal and mycobactericidal activities. However, no reports 
covered its anti-osteoclastogenesis characteristic. In this study, we found that 
AGR inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, bone-resorption, F-actin ring 
formation, and the mRNA expression of osteoclast-associated genes such as CTSK, 
TRAP, MMP-9, and ATP6v0d2 in vitro. In addition, AGR suppressed RANKL-induced 
expression of c-Fos and NFATc1. However, AGR treatment did not affect NF-κB 
activation and MAPKs phosphorylation in RANKL-stimulated BMMs, which implicated 
that AGR might not influence the initial expression of NFATc1 mediated by NF-κB 
and MAPKs signaling. Our results further indicated that AGR did not alter 
phosphorylation levels of GSK3β and the expression of calcineurin, which 
implicated that AGR treatment might not interfere with phosphorylation and 
de-phosphorylation of NFATc1 mediated by GSK3β and calcineurin, respectively. 
B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp1), which was regarded as a 
transcriptional repressor of negative regulators of osteoclastogenesis, was 
markedly attenuated in the presence of AGR, leading to the enhanced expression 
of B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6). Meanwhile, Blimp1 knockdown in BMMs by siRNA 
strongly enhanced the expression of Bcl6 and reduced NFATc1 induction by RANKL. 
These findings suggested that AGR inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast 
differentiation through Blimp1-Bcl-6 signaling mediated modulation of NFATc1 and 
its target genes. Consistent with these in vitro results, AGR exhibited a 
protective influence in an in vivo mouse model of LPS-induced bone loss by 
suppressing excessive osteoclast activity and attenuating LPS-induced bone 
destruction. Hence, these results identified that AGR could be considered as a 
potential therapeutic agent against bone lysis disease.

Development of fluorescent/luminescent probes for rapid, selective and sensitive 
detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is of great significance for 
understanding the roles of ROS in pathophysiological processes. In the present 
research, a visible-light-excitable Eu3+ complex-based probe, Eu(L)3(DPBT), is 
designed and synthesized for the time-gated luminescence (TGL) determination of 
hypochlorous acid (HClO) in vitro and in vivo. The proposed probe exhibits a 
rapid, selective and sensitive TGL response to HClO, and excellent localization 
of mitochondria in living cells with low cytotoxicity. These features allow the 
probe to be used for the TGL sensing and imaging of HClO formation in mimic 
inflammatory cells at a subcellular level, as well as in endotoxin-induced liver 
injury and rheumatoid arthritis in live mice. In addition, by immobilizing the 
probe in the PEG hydrogel, the smart sensor films with rapid response to HClO 
were prepared, and successfully used for the real-time monitoring of HClO 
generation in mouse wounds, in order to distinguish the infected wounds from 
acute ones. Overall, this study provides a useful tool for the clinical 
monitoring and treatment of wound diseases.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophic factor that is thought to have a 
broad role in the nervous system and tumors, and has recently been described as 
a mediator of inflammation. It is not clear whether or not NGF participates in 
apoptosis of articular chondrocytes. In this study, we determined if NGF affects 
ASIC1a expression and NF-κB P65 activation in rat chondrocytes, and measured the 
effectiveness of NGF on apoptotic protein expression in acid-induced 
chondrocytes. NGF was shown to up-regulate the level of ASIC1a in a dose- and 
time-dependent fashion. Simultaneously, NGF activated NF-κB P65 in chondrocytes. 
Additionally, the elevated ASIC1a expression induced by NGF was eliminated by 
the NF-κB inhibitor (PDTC) in chondrocytes. Moreover, NGF reduced cell viability 
and induced LDH release under the premise of acid-induced articular 
chondrocytes. Furthermore, NGF could enhance cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved-PARP 
expression in acid-pretreated chondrocytes, and which could be inhibited by 
using psalmotoxin 1(PcTX1) or PDTC. Together, these results indicated that NGF 
may up-regulate ASIC1a expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway, and 
further promote acid-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes.

Selective JAK3 inhibitors have been shown to have a potential benefit in the 
treatment of autoimmune disorders. Here we report the identification of a series 
of pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as potent JAK3 inhibitors that exploit a 
unique cysteine (Cys909) residue in JAK3. Most of these compounds (13k, 13n and 
13 t), displayed stronger anti-JAK3 kinase activity and selectivity than 
tofacitinib. Furthermore, the most active inhibitor 13t (IC50 = 0.1 nM), also 
exhibited favourable selectivity for JAK3 in a panel of 9 kinases which contain 
the same cysteine. In a series of cytokinestimulated cellular analysis, compound 
13 t, could potently block the JAK3-STAT signaling pathway. Further biological 
studies, including cellular antiproliferative activity assays and a rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis model for in vivo evaluation, also indicated its 
efficacy and low toxicity in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The results 
of these experimental explorations suggested that 13t is a promising lead 
compound for the development of selective JAK3 inhibitor with therapeutic 
potential in rheumatoid arthritis.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, involved in 
Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Anti-TNF-α therapeutic approaches currently 
used in autoimmune diseases have been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in AD. 
We have previously examined the role of TNF-α and anti-TNF-α drugs in AD, using 
5XFAD mice, and we have found a significant role for peripheral TNF-α in brain 
inflammation. Here we investigated the role of mouse TNF-α on the AD-like 
phenotype of 5XFAD mice using a knock-in mouse with deletion of the 3'UTR of the 
endogenous TNF-α (TNFΔARE/+) that develops rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's 
disease. 5XFAD/TNFΔARE/+ mice showed significantly decreased amyloid deposition. 
Interestingly, microglia but not astrocytes were activated in 5XFAD/ TNFΔARE/+ 
brains. This microglial activation was associated with increased infiltrating 
peripheral leukocytes and perivascular macrophages and synaptic degeneration. 
APP levels and APP processing enzymes involved in Aβ production remained 
unchanged, suggesting that the reduced amyloid burden can be attributed to the 
increased microglial and perivascular macrophage activation caused by TNF-α. 
Peripheral TNF-α levels were increased while brain TNF-α remained the same. 
These data provide further evidence for peripheral TNF-α as a mediator of 
inflammation between the periphery and the brain.

Acid-sensitive ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is a member of the extracellular H+ 
activated cation channel family. Studies have shown that tissue acidification 
contributes to the formation of microvessels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
synovial tissue, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the role of tissue acidification in microvascular 
formation of arthritic synovial tissue and the effect of ASIC1a on vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from arthritic synovial tissue. Our 
results indicate that ASIC1a expression, VEGF expression, and microvessel 
density (MVD) are elevated in RA synovial tissue and adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat 
synovial tissue. When AA rats were treated with ASIC1a-specific blocker 
psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx-1), the expression of ASIC1a, VEGF expression, and MVD were 
all reduced. Acidification of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) can promote the 
release of VEGF. PcTx-1 and ASIC1a-short hairpin RNA can inhibit acid-induced 
release of VEGF. In addition, the ASIC1a overexpression vector can promote 
acid-induced VEGF release. This indicates that extracellular acidification 
induces the release of VEGF by RASF via ASIC1a. These findings suggest that 
blocking ASIC1a mediates the release of VEGF from synoviocytes may provide a 
potential therapeutic strategy for RA therapy.

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is characterized by damage to cochlear neurons 
and associated hair cells; however, a systematic evaluation of NIHL pathogenesis 
is still lacking. Here, we systematically evaluated differentially expressed 
genes of 22 cochlear samples in an NIHL mouse model. We performed Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Core modules were detected 
using protein-protein interactions and WGCNA with functional annotation, 
diagnostic value evaluation, and experimental validation. Pooled functional 
annotation suggested the involvement of multiple inflammatory pathways, 
including the TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-kappa B 
signaling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis, and p53 signaling pathway. The core 
modules suggested that responses to cytokines, heat, cAMP, ATP, mechanical 
stimuli, and immune responses were important in NIHL pathogenesis. These 
activities primarily occurred on the external side of the plasma membrane, the 
extracellular region, and the nucleus. Binding activities, including CCR2 
receptor binding, protein binding, and transcription factor binding, may be 
important. Additionally, the hub molecules with diagnostic value included Relb, 
Hspa1b, Ccl2, Ptgs2, Ldlr, Plat, and Ccl17. An evaluation of Relb and Hspa1b 
protein levels showed that Relb was upregulated in spiral ganglion neurons, 
which might have diagnostic value. In conclusion, this study indicates that the 
inflammatory response is involved in auditory organ changes in NIHL 
pathogenesis; moreover, several molecules and activities have essential and 
subtle influences that have translational potential for pharmacological 
intervention.

Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory, and systemic autoimmune 
disease, it affects elders worldwide. Herbal medicines have been used for the 
treatment of various ailments from ancient times. Betelvine (Piper betle L.) 
leaves have long been used in Asian countries as a medicine to relieve pain and 
some metabolic diseases. The present study of methanolic extract of 
phytochemical analysis confirms the presence of alkaloids, tannins, terpenoids, 
saponins, steroids, total flavonoids and total phenols. GC-MS analysis of MeOH 
extract of Piper betle (PBME) revealed the presence of 40 bioactive compounds. 
In vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assays showed greater inhibitory 
effect. The anti-arthritic effects of PBME at 250 and 500 mg/kg concentration 
showed recovery from joint damage in in vivo rat model. Among the 40 GC-MS 
derived bioactives, 4-Allyl-1,2-Diacetoxybenzene exhibited the higher 
interactions with minimized binding energy to the RA targets of MMP 1 
(-6.4 kcal/mol), TGF-β (-6.9 kcal/mol), IL-1β (-5.9 kcal/mol). Further, the 
effect of PBME extract against RA molecular disease targets (IL-1β, MMP1 and 
TGF- β) were studied using Real-time PCR. These results substantiate that P. 
betle leaves could be a source of therapeutics for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis.

IgG immune complexes (ICs) promote autoimmunity through binding fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) γ-receptors (FcγRs). Of these, the highly prevalent FcγRIIa 
(CD32a) histidine (H)-131 variant (CD32aH) is strongly linked to human 
autoimmune diseases through unclear mechanisms. We show that, relative to the 
CD32a arginine (R)-131 (CD32aR) variant, CD32aH more avidly bound human (h) IgG1 
IC and formed a ternary complex with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) under 
acidic conditions. In primary human and mouse cells, both CD32a variants 
required FcRn to induce innate and adaptive immune responses to hIgG1 ICs, which 
were augmented in the setting of CD32aH. Conversely, FcRn induced responses to 
IgG IC independently of classical FcγR, but optimal responses required FcRn and 
FcγR. Finally, FcRn blockade decreased inflammation in a rheumatoid arthritis 
model without reducing circulating autoantibody levels, providing support for 
FcRn's direct role in IgG IC-associated inflammation. Thus, CD32a and FcRn 
coregulate IgG IC-mediated immunity in a manner favoring the CD32aH variant, 
providing a novel mechanism for its disease association.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association between animal exposure and 
risk for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA).
METHODS: Patients with GPA at the Department of Rheumatology, Uppsala University 
Hospital, between January 1st, 2011 to December 31st 2018 were consecutively 
included. All patients filled in a questionnaire on possible environmental 
exposures; occupation, spare time hobbies and animal contact. As controls we 
included 128 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 248 population controls 
collected from the EIRA study (Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid 
Arthritis), matched for age, gender and geographical area of residence. The 
controls filled out a questionnaire on current and past contact with farming and 
animals, at the time of the RA patient's diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 62 GPA-patients, 128 RA- and 248 population controls were 
included in the study. GPA was significantly associated with horse exposure with 
a two to three-fold increased risk (OR 3.08, 95%CI 1.34-7.08) and 2, 61 (95% CI 
1.29-5, 29) respectively. Borderline increased risks were found for any animal 
contact but no association was found when analyzing contact with cat/dog only. A 
significant association was found between GPA and farming compared to the 
population controls OR 7, 60 (95% CI 3, 21-17, 93.
CONCLUSION: This study has identified to our knowledge for the first time a 
significant association between a specific animal exposure, namely horses, and 
the development of GPA. The results also support previous studies reporting an 
association between farming and GPA, underscoring the possibility of exogenous 
factors as initiators in the development of GPA.

The inflammatory proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and 
functional imbalances in T lymphocytes play critical roles in the pathogenesis 
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The clinical efficacy of Huayu Tongbi Fang (HYTB, 
a traditional herbal formula) in RA treatment has been validated. In this study, 
we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of HYTB on the proliferation and 
differentiation of T lymphocytes, and the inhibitory effect of HYTB on 
inflammatory proliferation of FLSs. The RCS-364 (Rat FLSs) cells were cocultured 
with rat splenic lymphocytes that were induced by interleukin-1β in Transwell 
chambers. After freeze-dried HYTB powder treatment, the percentage of T-cell 
subset and apoptosis rates of FLSs were measured using flow cytometry. 
Furthermore, protein expression of key molecules of NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling 
pathways was quantified using Western blot. The granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was measured using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The results showed that HYTB could inhibit the inflammatory 
proliferation of FLSs through inducing cell apoptosis. Additionally, HYTB 
treatment could intervene in the proliferation and differentiation of T 
lymphocytes and regulate protein expression of key molecules in NF-κB and 
JAK/STAT cell signaling pathways. Moreover, it could inhibit FLS activation by 
suppressing GM-CSF production by T cells and FLSs. Therefore, the HYTB formula 
should be used as a traditional medicine against RA in modern complementary and 
alternative therapies.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a Tec family kinase with a well-defined role 
in the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway. It has become an attractive kinase target 
for selective B cell inhibition, and for the treatment of B cell related 
diseases. Many BTK inhibitors have been discovered for the treatment of cancer 
and rheumatoid arthritis, including a series of BTK inhibitors based on 
8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine we recently reported. The X-ray crystal 
structures of BTK with inhibitors were also published, which provided great help 
for the SAR design. Here we report our SAR work introducing ring constraints for 
the 3-position piperidine amides on the BTK inhibitors based on 
8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine. This modification improved the potency in BTK 
inhibitions, as well as the PK profile and the off-target selectivity. The 
dose-dependent efficacy of two BTK inhibitors was observed in the rat collagen 
induced arthritis (CIA) model.

CD83, either in its membrance-bound form (mCD83) or soluble form (sCD83), is an 
important immunomodulatory molecule in humans and mice. While mCD83 is 
immunostimulatory, sCD83 exhibits striking immunosuppressive activities, 
suggesting that sCD83 may be used to combat inflammatory diseases, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, graft-versus-host disease and habitual abortion. Although 
many studies had shed lights on the role of CD83 in humans and mice, little is 
known about CD83 in other animals. Recently, we showed that porcine CD83 had 
similar biochemical characteristics and immunoregulatory functions as its human 
counterpart. However, whether porcine sCD83 (psCD83) is involved in maintaining 
the immunological tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface and thereby prevents 
embryo loss and abortion during pregnancy is unclear. In this study, we used 
LPS-induced animal model to analyze the effect of porcine sCD83 on the mouse 
abortion. Results showed that psCD83 could significantly alleviate LPS-induced 
abortion in mice, indicating that the psCD83 had the function of fetal 
protection. Mechanically, psCD83-mediated fetal protection was related to the 
promotion on Th2 cytokine production, Treg cell differentiation and trophoblast 
invasion. This study provides a molecular basis for the fetal protection of 
psCD83, as well as a potential target for the regulation of maternal-fetal 
interfacial immune tolerance.

We describe a cysteine-rich, membrane-penetrating, joint-targeting, and 
remarkably stable peptide, EgK5, that modulates voltage-gated KV1.3 potassium 
channels in T lymphocytes by a distinctive mechanism. EgK5 enters plasma 
membranes and binds to KV1.3, causing current run-down by a phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate-dependent mechanism. EgK5 exhibits selectivity for KV1.3 over 
other channels, receptors, transporters, and enzymes. EgK5 suppresses 
antigen-triggered proliferation of effector memory T cells, a subset enriched 
among pathogenic autoreactive T cells in autoimmune disease. PET-CT imaging with 
18F-labeled EgK5 shows accumulation of the peptide in large and small joints of 
rodents. In keeping with its arthrotropism, EgK5 treats disease in a rat model 
of rheumatoid arthritis. It was also effective in treating disease in a rat 
model of atopic dermatitis. No signs of toxicity are observed at 10-100 times 
the in vivo dose. EgK5 shows promise for clinical development as a therapeutic 
for autoimmune diseases.

Two chemical series of novel protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) inhibitors, 
4,6-disubstituted and 5,7-disubstituted isoquinolines, were rapidly identified 
using our fragment merging strategy. This methodology involves biochemical 
screening of a high concentration of a monosubstituted isoquinoline fragment 
library, then merging hit isoquinoline fragments into a single compound. Our 
strategy can be applied to the discovery of other challenging kinase inhibitors 
without protein-ligand structural information. Furthermore, our optimization 
effort identified the highly potent and orally available 5,7-isoquinoline 37 
from the second chemical series. Compound 37 showed good efficacy in a mouse 
collagen-induced arthritis model. The in vivo studies suggest that PKCζ 
inhibition is a novel target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and that 
5,7-disubstituted isoquinoline 37 has the potential to elucidate the biological 
consequences of PKCζ inhibition, specifically in terms of therapeutic 
intervention for RA.

Pneumonia can cause high morbidity and mortality because of uncontrolled 
inflammation in the lung tissue. Calming the cytokine storm may be one key to 
saving the life of patients with severe pneumonia. Here, inspired by the 
intrinsic affinity of platelets to the site of inflammation, we have engineered 
platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) for pneumonia-targeted drug 
delivery. It is demonstrated that PEVs that are easily generated from the 
activated platelets can selectively target pneumonia in the mouse model with 
acute lung injury (ALI). By loading with 
[5-(p-fluorophenyl)-2-ureido]thiophene-3-carboxamide (TPCA-1), which can inhibit 
the production of inflammatory factors, the PEVs significantly improve 
therapeutic benefits by inhibiting the infiltration of pulmonary inflammatory 
cells and calming local cytokine storm compared with the free drug-treated 
group. Furthermore, we find that PEVs could serve as a broad platform that can 
selectively target various inflammatory sites, including chronic atherosclerotic 
plaque, rheumatoid arthritis, and wounds associated with skin.

PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) shares similar risk factors and 
inflammatory responses with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previously, we identified 
increased risk for dry AMD among patients with RA compared to control subjects, 
using retrospective data analysis. In this current study, we investigate the 
role of systemic inflammation triggered in a murine model of arthritis on 
choroidal neovascularization and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration 
mouse models.
METHODS: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in C57BL/6J mice prior to 
laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV; wet AMD model) or sodium 
iodate-induced retinal degeneration (NaIO3; dry AMD model). CNV lesion size and 
retinal thickness were quantified by optical coherence photography (OCT), visual 
function was analyzed using optokinetic response and electroretinography, RPE 
morphology was examined by immunohistochemistry, and inflammatory gene 
expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: CIA mice demonstrated decreased spatial acuity and contrast 
sensitivity, whereas no difference was observed in the RPE-generated c-wave. CNV 
lesion size was decreased in CIA mice. NaIO3 decreased c-wave amplitude, as well 
as retinal thickness, which was augmented by CIA. NaIO3 treatment resulted in 
loss of normal RPE hexagonal shape, which was further aggravated by CIA. 
Increased Cxcl9 expression was observed in the presence of CIA and CIA combined 
with AMD. Disease severity differences were observed between sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest systemic inflammation by CIA results in increased 
pathology in a dry AMD model, whereas it reduces lesions in a wet AMD model. 
These findings highlight the need for additional investigation into the role of 
secondary inflammation and sex-based differences on AMD.

Receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-independent 
osteoclastogenic pathway was reported recently. MicroRNA (miR)-124 has been 
known to suppress RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting NFATc1 
expression. However, whether miR-124 regulates a RANKL-independent pathway has 
not been elucidated. In this study, we examined whether a RANKL-independent 
pathway is regulated by miR-124 in addition to the RANKL-dependent one. Using 
osteoclastogenic culture and pit-formation assay, we found that a miR-124 mimic 
inhibited osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages stimulated 
by TNF-α, IL-6, and M-CSF in the presence of osteoprotegerin. We also showed 
that the expression levels of osteoclast-specific genes and NFATc1 protein were 
suppressed in the miR-124 mimic-transfected cells by performing 
quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Our results 
indicate that miR-124 is important in inhibiting both RANKL-dependent and 
-independent osteoclast differentiation by suppressing NFATc1-mediated pathway.

BACKGROUND: CD38+ NK cells are overabundant in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is an inhibitor of CD38. This study investigated 
the pathogenic role of CD38+ NK cells and the effect of C3G on RA.
METHODS: Rats with bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were injected 
with C3G. RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) or mononuclear cells (MNCs) were 
cultured with C3G. MNCs were also cocultured with CD38+ NK cells following C3G 
pretreatment.
RESULTS: C3G injection significantly alleviated CIA. C3G also significantly 
increased the level of interleukin (IL)-10 and the regulatory T (Treg) cell 
proportion, and it decreased the interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ 
levels and CD38+ NK cell proportion in rat peripheral blood and synovial fluid. 
Additionally, C3G significantly increased RASF apoptosis and decreased RASF 
proliferation and IL-6 production in the culture medium. Furthermore, C3G 
stimulated MNCs to increase IL-2 and IL-10 production and the Treg cell 
proportion, and it caused MNCs to decrease IL-6 and IFN-γ production and the 
CD38+ NK cell proportion. Although CD38+ NK cells significantly decreased the 
Treg cell proportion and IL-10 level in MNCs, CD38+ NK cells that had been 
pretreated with C3G increased the proportion of Treg cells and IL-10 levels and 
decreased the IL-6 and IFN-γ levels in the coculture. In CD38+ NK cells, C3G 
significantly increased Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) expression and the tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α level, and it decreased natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) 
expression and the IFN-γ level. However, when CD38+ NK cells were treated with 
Sirt6 siRNA, C3G did not change the NKG2D expression, the TNF-α level sharply 
decreased, and the IFN-γ level increased. When MNCs were cocultured with 
C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of TNF-α and an anti-IFN-γ 
antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion significantly increased. When MNCs 
were cocultured with C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of IFN-γ and 
an anti-TNF-α antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion sharply decreased. When 
CIA rats were injected with both C3G and the Sirt6 inhibitor OSS_128167, the 
rats exhibited joint inflammation and a low Treg cell proportion, but the CD38+ 
NK proportion was still low.
CONCLUSION: C3G has therapeutic effects on CIA and RA. C3G decreased the 
proportion of CD38+ cells, RASF proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine 
secretion, and it increased the Treg cell proportion. C3G also elevated Sirt6 
expression to suppress NKG2D expression, increase TNF-α secretion, and decrease 
IFN-γ secretion in CD38+ NK cells, which stimulates MNCs to differentiate into 
Treg cells. This study also demonstrates that the inhibition of Treg cell 
differentiation in MNCs by CD38+ NK cells is a potential cause of the immune 
imbalance in RA and CIA.

Proline-serine-threonine-phosphatase-interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2) is related 
to inflammation. In this study, we investigated the function of PSTPIP2 in 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to 
overexpress PSTPIP2 in rat. AIA rats were developed by injecting Lewis rats with 
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on day 0. AAV-empty or AAV-PSTPIP2, or PBS was 
administered intraarticularly into each knee joint on day 8 postinduction. All 
animals were killed at day 18 after adjuvant injection. WB was used to detect 
the expression of PSTPIP2 in rat synovial tissues. Fluorescence microscopy 
showed the transduction efficiency in synovial tissue. The morphology of 
arthritic joints was examined by HE, safranin O/fast green, or Toluidine blue 
staining. The bone destruction was examined via X-ray and micro-CT analysis. 
Immunohistochemical analysis or TRAP staining were used to investigate the role 
of PSTPIP2 in osteoclasts and the expression of PSTPIP2 in synovial tissue. 
RT-qPCR and ELISA were used to examine the expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in synovial tissue or serum. AIA rats were found to have decreased 
PSTPIP2 expression and AIA-associated bone loss and inflammatory infiltration. 
We showed that administration of AAV-PSTPIP2 before arthritis onset 
significantly reduces the severity of AIA. PSTPIP2 was highly expressed in 
synovial cells. In addition, inflammatory responses and the number of 
osteoclasts were reduced with AAV-PSTPIP2 treatment. These findings demonstrate 
that PSTPIP2 may improve the severity of AIA by inhibiting the function of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes, suppressing inflammation and reducing the number 
of osteoclasts.

Biologically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling 
molecules in the human body. Despite their importance under normal conditions, 
abnormal overproduction of ROS under unbalanced or irregular homeostasis can 
cause severe inflammatory diseases. Various antioxidants have been developed in 
the biomedical field to resolve high levels of ROS; however, high doses of 
natural antioxidants such as polyphenol can induce side effects on health. 
Further, synthetic antioxidants are still controversial in regards to their 
safety and their complicated synthesis. Inspired from our previous work, a 
nitric oxide-scavenging nanogel designed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, we 
report herein a biocompatible tannic acid (TA)-based nanogel as an effective ROS 
scavenger. A polymeric phenylboronic acid-tannic acid nanogel (PTNG) was 
prepared by simply mixing through to the formation of phenylboronic ester bonds 
between polymeric phenylboronate and TA. We focused on the reaction of 
phenylboronic ester with H2O2, which readily consumes H2O2 molecules, and 
applied it as an antioxidant. In addition, TA is a well-known antioxidant, 
specifically a free radical scavenger; thus, we expected combinatory ROS 
scavenging effects for PTNG. Various ROS scavenging assays revealed the 
significant antioxidant effects of PTNG. Under an induced inflammation model in 
vitro, our PTNG showed high biocompatibility as well as strong anti-inflammatory 
effects. Furthermore, in the zymosan-induced peritonitis mouse model, a 
representative acute inflammation model in vivo, PTNG reduced significant 
neutrophil recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating successful 
alleviation of inflammation. On the basis of these results, we suggest that PTNG 
has great potential as an antioxidant and should find application in the 
treatment of further ROS-overproducing inflammatory diseases.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common pulmonary manifestation of 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) lung disease. The mechanism of RA-ILD remains obscure 
and more effective treatments are still needed. Resveratrol (RSV) a phytoalexin 
found with anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity. RSV has been reported to 
protect against RA. In current study, we evaluated the effects of RSV on RA-ILD 
and further explored the underlying mechanisms. We established the RA-ILD rat 
model by injecting Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). After administration of RSV 
into RA-ILD rats, the disease parameters were assessed, inflammatory cytokines 
productions were analyzed, and the effects of RSV on JAK/STAT/RANKL were 
evaluated. Injection of FCA caused RA-ILD in rats, which had clear lung damage, 
fibrosis, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in both serum and lung. RSV 
treatment significantly ameliorated the lung disease and prevented 
pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In addition, RSV inhibited JAK/STAT/RANKL 
signaling pathway in RA-ILD rats. RSV treatment alleviates RA-ILD in rats by 
inhibiting JAK/STAT/RANKL signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder 
accompanied with hyperalgesia, edema and pain. At least 30% of the patients 
failed to respond to the available treatments and medications, which yet have a 
lot of serious adverse effects on patients. So, using novel technologies to 
produce more efficient medications is needed. According to the role of iron 
manipulation in inflammatory process, we have synthetized RAc1 nano particle, 
which contains zinc and has iron chelating property. In the present study, we 
evaluated RAc1 nano particle effects on hyperalgesia and liver hepcidin and 
serum IL-1β and TNF-α expression levels during acute and chronic phases of 
adjuvant-induced inflammation in male rats and compared its effects with 
Deferoxamine.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis was 
caused by single subcutaneous injection of CFA into the rat's hind paw on day 
zero. RAc1 with 100, 200 and 400 ng/kg doses and deferoxamin with doses of 
200 mg/kg after diluting in vehicles were administered daily (i.p.) during the 
21 days of the study after CFA injection. Hyperalgesia, Edema, liver hepcidin 
and serum IL-1β and TNF-α expression levels were assessed on days 0, 7, 14 and 
21 of the study.
RESULTS: The results of this study indicated the role of RAc1 nano particle 
administration in reducing paw edema, thermal hyperalgesia, and liver hepcidin 
and serum IL-1β and TNF-α expression even in comparison with Deferoxamine during 
different phases of inflammation caused by CFA.
CONCLUSION: It seems that RAc1 nano particle exerts its immune modulatory 
effects by decreasing liver hepcidin expression and serum IL-1β and TNF-α 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leads to pain through alteration of gene 
expression. Although gene expression alteration in knee cartilage or peripheral 
blood from RA patients has been identified using microarray, it remains unclear 
whether long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated gene regulation occurs in primary 
sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during RA-like joint inflammation. 
In the present study, we aimed to analyze lncRNA and related mRNA profiles in 
the DRG in a knee joint inflammation rat model.
METHODS: Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected in the rat knee joint for 
preparing the joint inflammation model. A lncRNA-mRNA microarray of rat DRG was 
employed for transcriptome analysis. Functional roles of differentially 
expressed lncRNAs and their related mRNAs in the injured DRG were delineated by 
bioinformatic analysis.
RESULTS: We observed that expression levels of 9000 lncRNAs were altered on day 
7 post-CFA, of which 45.17% were up-regulated and 54.83% were down-regulated. 
Specifically, 69 lncRNAs (42 up and 27 down) were significantly regulated. We 
also observed that expression levels of 13,744 mRNAs were altered on day 7 
post-CFA, of which 49.67% were up-regulated and 50.33% were down-regulated. 
Specifically, 102 mRNAs (51 up and 51 down) were significantly regulated. Using 
quantitative real-time PCR, we verified the changes in differentially expressed 
lncRNAs in the injured DRG.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that microarray-based RNA sequencing can be 
used to identify altered lncRNAs and relevant mRNAs in the DRG of rats with knee 
joint inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Syndecan-4 (sdc4) is a cell-anchored proteoglycan that consists of a 
transmembrane core protein and glucosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. Binding of 
soluble factors to the GAG chains of sdc4 may result in the dimerisation of sdc4 
and the initiation of downstream signalling cascades. However, the question of 
how sdc4 dimerisation and signalling affects the response of cells to 
inflammatory stimuli is unknown.
METHODS: Sdc4 immunostaining was performed on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) tissue 
sections. Interleukin (IL)-1 induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases 
(ERK) phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-3 production was 
investigated. Il-1 binding to sdc4 was investigated using immunoprecipitation. 
IL-1 receptor (IL1R1) staining on wild-type, sdc4 and IL1R1 knockout fibroblasts 
was performed in fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. A blocking sdc4 
antibody was used to investigate sdc4 dimerisation, IL1R1 expression and the 
histological paw destruction in the human tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
transgenic mouse.
RESULTS: We show that in fibroblasts, the loss of sdc4 or the antibody-mediated 
inhibition of sdc4 dimerisation reduces the cell surface expression of the IL-1R 
and regulates the sensitivity of fibroblasts to IL-1. We demonstrate that IL-1 
directly binds to sdc4 and in an IL-1R-independent manner leads to its 
dimerisation. IL-1-induced dimerisation of sdc4 regulates caveolin 
vesicle-mediated trafficking of the IL1R1, which in turn determines the 
responsiveness to IL-1. Administration of antibodies (Ab) against the 
dimerisation domain of sdc4, thus, strongly reduces the expression IL1R1 on 
arthritic fibroblasts both in vitro and an animal model of human RA.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest that Ab that specifically inhibit 
sdc4 dimerisation may support anti-IL-1 strategies in diseases such as 
inflammatory arthritis.

PURPOSE: We intend to assess the effect of the conditioned medium of Caffeine 
pulsed MSCS in the amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-afflicted rats.
METHODS: MSCs were incubated with 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 1 mM Caffeine for 2 weeks. RA 
was induced by the injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the base 
of the tail of Wistar rats. According to in vitro studies, RA rats were 
intraperitoneally treated with MSCs, Caffeine (0.5 mM) pulsed MSCs or vehicle on 
day 14 when all rats had shown signs of RA.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that the least effective dose concentration of 
Caffeine that can induce potent anti-inflammatory property in the MSC population 
is 0.5 mM. Without any significant impact on the vitality or MScs' marker, 
Caffeine at this concentration could induce lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and 
IL-1β and a higher level of IDO, TGF-β, and IL-10 compared to other groups. 
Therefore, MSCs pulsed with Caffeine at 0.5 mM concentration was selected for in 
vitro studies. Caffeine pulsed MSCs could reduce the severity of the disease and 
improve weight-gaining more profoundly than treatment with MSCs alone. 
Furthermore, Caffeine pulsed MSCs caused a significant reduction in the serum 
levels C-reactive protein, Nitric oxide, Myeloperoxidase, TNF-α and conversely 
led a significant increase in the levels of IL-10 more prominent than the 
similar findings brought about by MSCs alone.
CONCLUSION: In general, caffeine-treated MSCs may be a promising strategy for 
cell-based therapy of RA.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by 
the destruction of cartilage and bone. The present study aims to investigate the 
role of HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HtrA2) in the collagen-induced arthritis. The 
expressions of HtrA2 were determined in the database BioGPS and bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The populations of myeloid and lymphoid 
cells were determined in wild type and HtrA2 knockout (HtrA2MKO) mice using flow 
cytometry. In addition, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il6, Tnf, 
and Il1β) were determined in the activated BMDMs from wild type (WT) and 
HtrA2MKO mice. STRING database was used to predict the interactive proteins of 
HtrA2 and Co-Immunoprecipitation was used to confirm these interactions. A 
collagen-induced arthritis model was established to investigate the effects of 
HtrA2 on the arthritis symptoms. It was found that HtrA2 reduction was 
associated with the activation of myeloid cells. Interestingly, HtrA2 deficiency 
did not affect the development of myeloid and lymphoid cells. Further studies 
demonstrated that HtrA2 deficiency suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in BMDMs induced by lipopolysaccharide or CpG. Co-Immunoprecipitation 
results demonstrated that HtrA2 enhanced the stability of TNF 
receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). HtrA2 participated in the activation of 
the inflammatory response in a collagen-induced arthritis model. In summary, 
HtrA2 modulates inflammatory responses in BMDMs by controlling TRAF2 stability 
in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model.

According to the Chinese medicine, magnoflorine exerted significant 
anti-inflammatory effects and potentially promoted synthesis of proteoglycans in 
chondrocytes to reverse the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 
latent beneficial effect of magnoflorine for the treatment of traumatic 
osteoarthritis (OA) is still unknown. Therefore, we aim to demonstrate the 
efficacy of magnoflorine combined with HA-gel in attenuating cartilage 
degeneration in anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) induced OA rat 
model. We found that the histological results showed the elevated cartilage 
matrix, chondrogenic signals and chondroprogenitor cells in HA-gel + 
magnoflorine treatment. HA-gel + magnoflorine treatment resulted in a decreased 
modified Mankin's score, and a higher volume ratio of hyaline cartilage 
(HC)/calcified cartilage (CC) and HC/Sum (whole cartilage), compared to ACLT and 
HA-gel groups. Furthermore, both the volume ratios of HC/Sum and HC/CC were 
negatively correlated with modified Mankin's scores. Finally, HA-gel + 
magnoflorine could significantly increase the BV/TV, Tb.Th, and decrease the 
Tb.Pf, Po(tot), Conn.Dn and Tb.Sp. In vitro, 50 μg/ml magnoflorine treatment 
could significantly increase the viability, S-phase, migration rate and 
chondrogenesis of chondroprogenitor cells. There were significant 
downregulations of MAPK/NF-κB signaling, and upregulations of chondrogenic 
signals in 50 μg/ml magnoflorine treatment. There were significant 
downregulations of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of IL-10 in HA-gel 
+ magnoflorine treated group. Therefore, our study elucidated a protective 
effect of HA-gel + magnoflorine on attenuating cartilage degradation and 
maintaining SCB stabilization in ACLT induced OA.

BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine considers that rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) is caused by blood stasis, heat, and toxins. Xuebijing (XBJ), a traditional 
Chinese medicine compound injection, activates blood circulation to dissipate 
blood stasis, eliminating pathogenic heat from the blood and degrading toxins. 
XBJ was approved by the China FDA to treat for many years. This study examined 
the potential therapeutic effects of XBJ on RA and rat collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: XBJ was cultured with the synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients. XBJ was 
also injected into CIA rats. Changes in Treg and Th17 cell levels in the 
peripheral blood (PB), SF, and spleen and changes in Th1/Th2 and cytokine levels 
in PB were detected using flow cytometry. Four RA patients were treated using

Emerging data revealed that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with higher 
risk of cerebrovascular diseases. Whereas cerebral endothelial dysfunction is 
acknowledged as a critical aspect of cerebrovascular diseases, its presence in 
RA and the mechanisms involved are currently unknown. By using the model of rat 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), the present study investigated cerebrovascular 
reactivity in pressurized middle cerebral arteries (MCA) on day 33 
post-immunization. The results revealed that arthritis induced a dramatic 
decrease in the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine (ACh), ADP, and 
bradykinin (n = 7-9 arteries, p < 0.0001). By using nor-NOHA, L-NAME, BH4, and 
Tempol, the results showed that the reduced response to ACh relied on arginase 
overactivation (n = 8), low NOS activity (n = 8), BH4 deficiency (n = 9), and 
excessive superoxide production (n = 9). Immunohistological analysis revealed an 
endothelial upregulation of arginase 2 (p < 0.05, n = 5-6) and NADPH oxidase 
(p < 0.05, n = 5-7) while eNOS expression was unchanged in AIA (n = 6). To 
assess whether arginase inhibition may be a relevant therapeutic, AIA rats were 
treated with an arginase inhibitor (nor-NOHA, 40 mg/kg/day, i.p., n = 20 rats) 
daily from day 10 to day 33 post-immunization. The treatment alleviated the 
impaired response of MCA to endothelium-dependent agonists, through an increase 
in NOS signaling and a suppression of BH4 deficiency and superoxide 
overproduction. By contrast, it did not change the course of arthritis. In 
conclusion, arthritis induced a cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction 
involving an imbalance in the arginase/NOS pathway. Arginase inhibition appears 
as a promising therapy beyond anti-rheumatic drugs for reducing the risk of 
cerebrovascular diseases in RA.

CARD9 is an immune adaptor protein in myeloid cells that is involved in C-type 
lectin signaling and antifungal immunity. CARD9 is implicated in autoimmune and 
inflammatory-related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, IgA nephropathy, 
ankylosing spondylitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given that 
Lyn-deficient (Lyn-/-) mice are susceptible to both autoimmunity and IBD, we 
investigated the immunological role of CARD9 in the development of these 
diseases using the Lyn-/- mouse model. We found that genetic deletion of CARD9 
was sufficient to reduce the development of both spontaneous autoimmune disease 
as well as DSS- or IL-10 deficiency-associated colitis in Lyn-/- mice. 
Mechanistically, CARD9 was a vital component of the Lyn-mediated regulation of 
Toll-like receptor (TLR2 and TLR4) signaling in dendritic cells, but not in 
macrophages. In the absence of Lyn, signaling through a CD11b-Syk-PKCδ-CARD9 
pathway was amplified, leading to increased TLR-induced production of 
inflammatory cytokines. Dendritic cell-specific deletion of CARD9 reversed the 
development of autoimmune and experimental colitis observed in dendritic 
cell-specific, Lyn-deficient mice. These findings suggest that targeting CARD9 
may suppress the development of colitis and autoimmunity by reducing dendritic 
cell-driven inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Immune complexes (ICs) play a critical role in the pathology of 
autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to generate and characterise a 
first-in-class anti-FcγRIIA antibody (Ab) VIB9600 (previously known as MEDI9600) 
that blocks IgG immune complex-mediated cellular activation for clinical 
development.
METHODS: VIB9600 was humanised and optimised from the IV.3 Ab. Binding affinity 
and specificity were determined by Biacore and ELISA. Confocal microscopy, Flow 
Cytometry-based assays and binding competition assays were used to assess the 
mode of action of the antibody. In vitro cell-based assays were used to 
demonstrate suppression of IC-mediated inflammatory responses. In vivo target 
suppression and efficacy was demonstrated in FcγRIIA-transgenic mice. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic study multiple dose Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies were conducted in non-human primates.
RESULTS: We generated a humanised effector-deficient anti-FcγRIIA antibody 
(VIB9600) that potently blocks autoantibody and IC-mediated proinflammatory 
responses. VIB9600 suppresses FcγRIIA activation by blocking ligand engagement 
and by internalising FcγRIIA from the cell surface. VIB9600 inhibits IC-induced 
type I interferons from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (involved in SLE), 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-induced production of reactive oxygen 
species by neutrophils (involved in ANCA-associated vasculitis) and IC-induced 
tumour necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 production (involved in rheumatoid 
arthritis). In FcγRIIA transgenic mice, VIB9600 suppressed antiplatelet 
antibody-induced thrombocytopaenia, acute anti-GBM Ab-induced nephritis and 
anticollagen Ab-induced arthritis. VIB9600 also exhibited favourable PK and 
safety profiles in cynomolgus monkey studies.
CONCLUSIONS: VIB9600 is a specific humanised antibody antagonist of FcγRIIA with 
null effector function that warrants further clinical development for the 
treatment of IC-mediated diseases.

Anti-TNF agents have been in the first line of treatment of various inflammatory 
diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's Disease, with a number of 
different biologics being currently in use. A detailed analysis of their effect 
at transcriptome level has nevertheless been lacking. We herein present a 
concise analysis of an extended transcriptomics profiling of four different 
anti-TNF biologics upon treatment of the established hTNFTg (Tg197) mouse model 
of spontaneous inflammatory polyarthritis. We implement a series of 
computational analyses that include clustering of differentially expressed 
genes, functional analysis and random forest classification. Taking advantage of 
our detailed sample structure, we devise metrics of treatment efficiency that 
take into account changes in gene expression compared to both the healthy and 
the diseased state. Our results suggest considerable variability in the capacity 
of different biologics to modulate gene expression that can be attributed to 
treatment-specific functional pathways and differential preferences to restore 
over- or under-expressed genes. Early intervention appears to manage 
inflammation in a more efficient way but is accompanied by increased effects on 
a number of genes that are seemingly unrelated to the disease. Administration at 
an early stage is also lacking in capacity to restore healthy expression levels 
of under-expressed genes. We record quantifiable differences among anti-TNF 
biologics in their efficiency to modulate over-expressed genes related to immune 
and inflammatory pathways. More importantly, we find a subset of the tested 
substances to have quantitative advantages in addressing deregulation of 
under-expressed genes involved in pathways related to known RA comorbidities. 
Our study shows the potential of transcriptomic analyses to identify 
comprehensive and distinct treatment-specific gene signatures combining 
disease-related and unrelated genes and proposes a generalized framework for the 
assessment of drug efficacy, the search of biosimilars and the evaluation of the 
efficacy of TNF small molecule inhibitors.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease that is 
characterized by T helper 17 (Th17) cell- and osteoclast-induced joint 
destruction and inflammation. In RA, several cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, 
6,17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) are involved in almost all aspects of 
articular inflammation and destruction. This study aimed to evaluate the 
combinatorial effect of TNF and IL-6 inhibitors on the differentiation and 
activation of Th17 cells and osteoclasts in the context of RA, and to identify 
the RA-related mechanisms through IL-6 signaling. Tetrahydropapaverine (THP) 
showed direct binding to TNF in screening-ELISA, and SPR and TNF-neutralization 
assays. In a previous study, the therapeutic effect of gp130-targeting LMT-28 
was confirmed in RA. Combinatorial treatment with LMT-28 and THP reduced the 
arthritis index and showed protective effects against bone and cartilage 
destruction in CIA mice. The secretion levels of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β 
significantly decreased upon combinatorial treatment with LMT-28 and THP. 
Further, the LMT-28 and THP combination suppressed the differentiation and 
activation of Th17 cells in mouse splenocytes and human PBMCs. In human RA-FLS, 
the LMT-28 and THP combination inhibited cell proliferation and downregulated 
IL-6 and/or TNF-mediated signaling relative to that observed upon independent 
treatment with LMT-28 or THP. Furthermore, the combination of LMT-28 and THP 
significantly inhibited the differentiation of mouse bone marrow monocytes 
(BMMs) into osteoclasts. In conclusion, the LMT-28 and THP combination can 
attenuate RA through the inhibition of Th17 differentiation and 
osteoclastogenesis, and suppression of IL-6 or TNF-induced signaling pathways. 
This combinatorial therapy could be used as a new strategy for the treatment of 
RA.

Collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA) in Dark Agouti rats, a model of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reproduces sexual dimorphism in the incidence and 
severity of the human disease. Th17 cells are central in the 
induction/propagation of autoimmune inflammation in CIA and RA. To assess 
mechanisms underlying this dimorphism in CIA rats, in lymph nodes draining 
inflamed joints and adjacent tissues (dLNs) from CIA rats of both sexes 
Th17/CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ T-regulatory cell (Treg) ratio, Th17 cell redifferentiation 
in functionally distinct subsets and Treg transdifferentiation into 
IL-17-producing cells (exTregs) were examined. In female rats (developing more 
severe CIA than their male counterparts) the higher frequency of all Th17 cells 
(reflecting partly their greater proliferation), followed by the higher 
frequency of highly pathogenic IFN-γ/GM-CSF-co-producing cells, but lower 
frequency of less pathogenic/immunoregulatory IL-10-producing cells among them 
was found. Additionally, compared with male rats, in female rats the lower 
frequency of Tregs was observed. Moreover, Tregs from female rats exhibited 
diminished proliferative and suppressive capacity (judging by PD-1 expression) 
and enhanced conversion into IL-17-producing cells. Given that TGF-β 
concentration was comparable in collagen-type II-stimulated dLN cell cultures 
from female and male rats, the shift in Th17/Treg ratio followed by augmented 
Th17 cell redifferentiation into IFN-γ/GM-CSF-co-producing cells and Treg 
transdifferentiation into IL-17-producing cells in female rats was associated 
with increased concentration of IL-6 in female rat dLN cell cultures, and the 
higher frequency of IL-1β- and IL-23-producing cells among their dLN cells. The 
lower frequency of IL-10-producing B cells, presumably B regulatory cells 
(Bregs) could also contribute to the shift in Th17/Treg ratio in female rat 
compared with male rat dLNs. Consistently, the lower expression of IL-35 (the 
cytokine promoting Treg expansion directly and indirectly, by favoring Breg 
expansion and conversion into IL-10/IL-35-producing cells) in female rat dLN 
cells was detected. Thus, the study identified putative cellular and molecular 
substrates of the sexual dimorphism in the immunopathogenesis and clinical 
outcome of CIA and suggested mechanisms to be targeted in females to improve 
control of Th17 response, and consequently clinical outcome of CIA, and possibly 
RA.

The benzylideneacetophenone derivative 
3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-1-{3-[1]-phenyl}-propenone (JC3 dimer) was 
synthesized through the dimerization of JC3. To investigate the inhibitory 
effects of JC3 dimer, the carrageenan/kaolin (C/K)-induced knee arthritis rat 
model was used in vivo and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient-derived 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were used in vitro. In the C/K rat model, JC3 
dimer was given after arthritis induction for 6 days at the concentrations of 1, 
5, or 10 mg/kg/day. Manifestation of arthritis was evaluated using knee 
thickness, weight distribution ratio (WDR), and squeaking test. The levels of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
in the serum of JC3 dimer-treated arthritic rats were also analyzed. 
Histological examination of the knee joints was also done. For the FLS, the 
cells were stimulated using IL-1β and concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL JC3 
dimer were used. The levels of IL-8, IL-6, and PGE2 were measured in stimulated 
FLS treated with JC3 dimer. At days 5 to 6 after arthritis induction, JC3 dimer 
treatment significantly decreased arthritic symptoms and reduced the 
inflammation in the knee joints in the histology of knee tissues in 
C/K-arthritic rats. In stimulated FLS, JC3 dimer suppressed the increase of 
IL-8, IL-6, and PGE2. These findings suggest that JC3 dimer has suppressive 
effects on arthritis, and that JC3 dimer can be a potential agent for arthritis 
therapy.

In this study, we investigated the clinical value of CC chemokine ligand 2 
(CCL2) and CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) in osteoarthritis (OA). A prospective 
analysis was performed on 126 patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the knee 
(observation group (OG)) who admitted to Qilu hospital from August 2016 to 
August 2018 and 135 healthy controls (control group (CG)) who underwent physical 
examinations during the same period. The concentrations of CCL2 and CCL3 in 
peripheral blood were compared between the two groups, and the predictive value 
of the two on the occurrence, efficacy and prognosis of recurrence of OA were 
analyzed. In addition, an OA rat model was established to detect the relative 
protein levels of CCL2 and CCL3 in rat knee joint tissues. There were no 
statistically significant differences between the two groups in baseline data 
such as age, body mass index (BMI), gender, smoking, drinking, educational 
level, family medical history and living environment (P > 0.05). CCL2 and CCL3 
increased in peripheral blood of patients in the OG (P < 0.05), both of which 
were positively correlated with rheumatoid factor (RF) (P < 0.001). CCL2 and 
CCL3 were of good predictive value for the occurrence, efficacy and prognosis of 
recurrence of OA (P < 0.001). The relative protein levels of CCL2 and CCL3 in 
bone and joint tissues of OA rats were significantly higher than those of normal 
rats (P < 0.001). CCL2 and CCL3 are elevated in peripheral blood of OA patients, 
which have good predictive value for the occurrence, efficacy and prognosis of 
recurrence of OA, indicating their potential roles as excellent markers for 
diagnosis and treatment of OA in the future.

BACKGROUND: Although disease in a majority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 
is often initially limited to one or a few joints, currently approved 
medications including anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody (α-TNF) are injected 
systemically. Given that α-TNF systemic injection typically does not cure RA and 
involves risk of treatment-related adverse events, one possible approach to 
enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce α-TNF systemic exposure is to retain the 
antibodies in arthritic joints after local administration. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the approach of conferring extracellular matrix (ECM) binding 
affinity to α-TNF antibodies in a RA model.
METHODS: α-TNF was chemically conjugated with a promiscuous ECM-binding peptide 
derived from placenta growth factor 2 (PlGF-2123-144). The binding activity of 
PlGF-2123-144-conjugated α-TNF (PlGF-2123-144-α-TNF) against ECM proteins was 
assessed by ELISA and by immunostaining on human cartilage specimens. The effect 
of conjugation on antibody function was assessed as a neutralizing activity 
against osteoclast differentiation. Retention at the injection site and 
therapeutic efficacy of PlGF-2123-144-α-TNF were tested in a collagen 
antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model in the mouse.
RESULTS: PlGF-2123-144 peptide conjugation conferred α-TNF with affinity to ECM 
proteins without impairment of antigen recognition. PlGF-2123-144-α-TNF locally 
injected at a paw in the CAIA model was retained for at least 96 h at the 
injection site, whereas unmodified α-TNF was dispersed rapidly after injection. 
Local treatment with unmodified α-TNF did not suppress the arthritis score 
relative to isotype controls. By contrast, local administration of 
PlGF-2123-144-α-TNF suppressed arthritis development almost completely in the 
treated paw even at a 1000× lower dose.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that retention of α-TNF in arthritic joints 
can suppress arthritis development and enhance therapeutic efficacy. This simple 
bioengineering approach of ECM-binding peptide conjugation offers a powerful and 
clinically translational approach to treat RA.

Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease 
hallmarked by irreversible damage of cartilage and bone. Matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in connective tissue remodeling play an 
important role in this process. Numerous MMPs have been examined in humans and 
animals, but their functions are still not fully understood. Therefore, we 
investigated the role of MMPs in the K/BxN serum-transfer model of RA with the 
broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD) using 
complex in vivo and in vitro methodolgy. Methods: Chronic arthritis was induced 
by repetitive i.p. injections of K/BxN serum in C57BL/6J mice. SDD was 
administered daily in acidified drinking water (0.5 mg/mL, 80 mg/kg) during the 
30 days experimental period. Mechanonociceptive threshold of the paw was 
evaluated by aesthesiometry, grasping ability by grid test, arthritis severity 
by scoring, neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity by luminescence, vascular 
hyperpermeability and MMP activity by fluorescence in vivo imaging and the 
latter also by gelatin zymography, bone structure by micro-computed tomography 
(micro-CT). Plasma concentrations of doxycycline were determined by liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Results: K/BxN serum induced 
significant inflammatory signs, mechanical hyperalgesia, joint function 
impairment, increased myeloperoxidase activity and vascular hyperpermeability. 
Significant increase of MMP activity was also observed both in vivo and ex vivo 
with elevation of the 57-60, 75, and 92 kDa gelatinolytic isoforms in the 
arthritic ankle joints, but neither MMP activity nor any above described 
functional parameters were influenced by SDD. Most importantly, SDD 
significantly reduced bone mineral density in the distal tibia and enhanced the 
Euler number in the ankle. Arthritis-induced microarchitectural alterations 
demonstrating increased irregularity and cancellous bone remodeling, such as 
increased Euler number was significantly elevated by SDD in both regions. 
Conclusion: We showed increase of various MMP activities in the joints by in 
vivo fluorescence imaging together with ex vivo zymography, and investigated 
their functional significance using the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor SDD in the 
translational RA model. This is the first demonstration that SDD worsens 
arthritis-induced bone microarchitectural alterations, but it appears to be 
independent of MMP inhibition.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease associated with severe joint 
pain. Herein, we report lornoxicam loaded cellulosic microsponge gel formulation 
with sustained anti-inflammatory effects that are required to manage arthritic 
pain. The microsponges were formulated using quasi emulsion-solvent diffusion 
method employing four different surfactant systems, namely polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA), Tween80, Gelucire 48/16 and Gelucire 50/13. All the lornoxicam loaded 
microsponge formulations were extensively characterized with a variety of 
analytical tools. The optimized microsponge formulation was then converted into 
gel formulation. The lornoxicam loaded microsponge gel formulation had adequate 
viscosity and sufficient pharmaceutical properties as confirmed by the texture 
analysis and the drug release followed Super case II transport. It is noteworthy 
that we described the preparation of a new cellulosic polymers based microsponge 
system for delivery of lornoxicam to provide quick as well as lasting 
(sustained) anti-inflammatory effects in rats using carrageenan induced rat paw 
edema model. We were able to demonstrate a 72% reduction in inflammation within 
4 h using the optimize transdermal gel formulation utilizing Transcutol P as 
permeation enhancer and with the aid of skin micro-piercing by microneedles, 
hence, demonstrating the potential of this microsponge gel formulation in 
arthritis management.

Helminthic infection and the parallel host immune reactions are the results of a 
protracted dynamic co-interaction between the host and worms. An assessment of 
the effect of Toxocara canis infection on arthritis in rats stimulated by 
Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) was the main purpose of the investigation. An 
arthritis model was established by the administration of 0.1 mL FCA in the 
palmar surface. Cytokine assessment, evaluating oedema and the use of a 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) score provided evidence of the protective effects of 
T canis against adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). The cytokines TGF-β, IFN-ɣ, 
IL-10 and IL-17 were measured to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of T canis 
infection. Besides, arthritis swelling findings were evaluated in rat paws. The 
data showed that T canis infection significantly modulated the immune response 
by alleviating inflammatory cytokines and increasing TGF-β as an 
anti-inflammatory cytokine. Evaluations of arthritis swelling showed low 
severity and faster recuperation. These findings suggest that the products 
derived from T canis eggs might be a potential therapeutic candidate to treat 
autoimmune diseases like the arthritis.

Hepatotoxicity is an adverse side effect of methotrexate (MTX) administration 
for the treatment of different malignancies, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA). Naringenin (NAR) is a citrus flavone with multiple pharmacological 
characteristics. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects 
of NAR on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. For this purpose, 32 Wistar rats 
were randomly divided into four experimental groups as group 1 Control, group 2 
NAR (50 mg/kg/d, o.p.), group 3 MTX (20 mg/kg/d, i.p.), group 4 NAR + MTX. NAR 
was administrated for 10 consecutive days and MTX was injected on the ninth day. 
The results indicated that MTX significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), 
NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in the liver. On the other hand, administration of 
MTX reduced the GSH content, as well as CAT, SOD, and GPx levels. NAR 
administration remarkably improved MTX-induced alteration of biochemical 
biomarkers. Our findings were confirmed by the histopathological examination of 
the liver. Based on our findings, NAR may inhibit MTX-induced hepatotoxicity 
through scavenging reactive free radicals and inducing anti-inflammatory 
effects.

The recognition of ω-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) as essential fatty acids to 
normal growth and health was realized more than 80 years ago. However, the 
awareness of the long-term nutritional intake of ω-3 PUFAs in lowering the risk 
of a variety of chronic human diseases has grown exponentially only since the 
1980s (1, 2). Despite the overwhelming epidemiological evidence, many attempts 
of using fish-oil supplementation to intervene human diseases have generated 
conflicting and often ambiguous outcomes; null or weak supporting conclusions 
were sometimes derived in the subsequent META analysis. Different dosages, as 
well as the sources of fish-oil, may have contributed to the conflicting 
outcomes of intervention carried out at different clinics. However, over the 
past decade, mounting evidence generated from genetic mouse models and clinical 
studies has shed new light on the functions and the underlying mechanisms of ω-3 
PUFAs and their metabolites in the prevention and treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and type 1 
diabetes. In this review, we have summarized the current understanding of the 
effects as well as the underlying mechanisms of ω-3 PUFAs on autoimmune 
diseases.

Previously, we reported that mRNA expression of ficolin-1 (FCN1), a component of 
the complement lectin pathway, is elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
of patients with vasculitis syndrome, and that FCN1-positive cells infiltrate 
into inflamed regions in patient specimens. In addition, we reported that the 
serum FCN1 concentration is elevated in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), a 
pediatric vasculitis, but dramatically decreases after intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Furthermore, we showed that FCN1 binds to IgG1 
in a pull-down assay. These results suggested that removal of FCN1 may be a 
therapeutic mechanism of IVIG. In this study, we prepared anti-FCN1 monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) and examined its therapeutic potential in mice treated with 
Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS), which induces KD-like vasculitis 
in the coronary artery. Indeed, treatment with anti-FCN1 mAb decreased the 
histological score of vasculitis (P = 0.03). To investigate the role of FCN1, we 
assessed blood samples of patients with various autoimmune diseases and 
demonstrated that serum levels of FCN1 were elevated not only in patients with 
vasculitis, but also in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, 
FCN1-targeted treatment of a mouse model of arthritis [collagen antibody-induced 
arthritis (CAIA)] revealed that administration of anti-FCN1 mAb ameliorated 
symptoms of arthritis (P < 0.01). These results suggest that FCN1 is involved in 
the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and that targeting FCN1 represents a 
promising strategy for treating these diseases.

OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms underlying the effects of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 
and autophagy on rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-aggravated periodontitis are unclear. 
We aimed to explore a novel target, cathepsin K (Ctsk)-mediated TLR9-related 
autophagy, during the progress of periodontitis with RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DBA/J1 mouse model of periodontitis with RA was created 
by local colonization of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and injection of 
collagen. The expression of Ctsk was inhibited by adeno-associated virus (AAV). 
Micro-CT, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot and quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of 
TLR9-related autophagy in periodontitis with RA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) were applied in macrophages. Western 
blot, immunofluorescence (IF) and qRT-PCR were used to verify the in vivo 
results.
RESULTS: RA can promote periodontitis bone destruction in the lesion area, while 
inhibiting Ctsk could effectively alleviate this effect. The infiltration of 
macrophages, TLR9, autophagy proteins (TFEB and LC3) and inflammatory cytokines 
increased in the periodontitis-with-RA group and was reduced by the inhibition 
of Ctsk in the periodontal region. Macrophage stimulation confirmed the in vivo 
results. With the activation of TLR9 by CpG ODN, inhibition of Ctsk could 
suppress both TLR9 downstream signalling proteins and autophagy-related 
proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: This study advanced a novel role for Ctsk in TLR9 and autophagy to 
explain the interaction between periodontitis and RA.

Epigenetic modifications have been shown to be important for immune cell 
differentiation by regulating gene transcription. However, the role and 
mechanism of histone methylation in the development and differentiation of iNKT 
cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mice have yet to be deciphered. The DBA/1 
mouse RA model was established by using a modified GPI mixed peptide. We 
demonstrated that total peripheral blood, thymus, and spleen iNKT cells in RA 
mice decreased significantly, while iNKT1 in the thymus and spleen was increased 
significantly. PLZF protein and PLZF mRNA levels were significantly decreased in 
thymus DP T cells, while T-bet protein and mRNA were significantly increased in 
thymus iNKT cells. We found a marked accumulation in H3K27me3 around the 
promoter regions of the signature gene Zbtb16 in RA mice thymus DP T cells, and 
an accumulation of H3K4me3 around the promoters of the Tbx21 gene in iNKT cells. 
The expression levels of UTX in the thymus of RA mice were significantly 
reduced. The changes in the above indicators were particularly significant in 
the progressive phase of inflammation (11 days after modeling) and the peak 
phase of inflammation (14 days after modeling) in RA mice. Developmental and 
differentiation defects of iNKT cells in RA mice were associated with abnormal 
methylation levels (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) in the promoters of key genes Zbtb16 
(encoding PLZF) and Tbx21 (encoding T-bet). Decreased UTX of thymus histone 
demethylase levels resulted in the accumulation of H3K27me3 modification.

OBJECTIVE: In autoimmune arthritis, TCR signalling is attenuated by peripheral 
tolerance mechanisms. We have described previously a population of inhibitory 
receptor LIR-1 expressing autoreactive CD8+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. 
Here, we investigated the role of CD8+ T cells in murine autoimmune arthritis by 
analysing their expression of the mouse orthologue of LIR-1, PIR-B.
METHODS: Frequencies of PIR-B+CD8+ T cells were determined in the SKG arthritis 
model. The phenotype of those cells was determined ex vivo by FACS and 
functionality was investigated by means of cytokine production and cytolytic 
potential upon activation in vitro.
RESULTS: SKG mice, under non-SPF (specific pathogen-free) conditions with 
clinical symptoms of arthritis, were found to harbour significantly increased 
frequencies of PIR-B+CD8+ T cells. Those cells showed a pro-inflammatory 
phenotype with preferential production of IL-17 and IFN-γ. The frequency of 
those cells correlated inversely with the arthritis score, indicating that they 
might represent autoreactive, but functionally inhibited, CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: PIR-B+CD8+ T cells from SKG mice show a cytotoxic and 
pro-inflammatory phenotype. Inhibition of CD8+ T cell autoreactivity by 
PIR-B/LIR-1 receptor signalling might be a counter-regulatory mechanism to curb 
autoreactivity and arthritis.

Exosomes, also known as extracellular vesicles, are naturally occurring, 
biocompatible, and bioacive nanoparticles ranging from 40 to 150 nm in diameter. 
Bone-secreted exosomes play important roles in bone homeostasis, the 
interruption of which can lead to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and osteopetrosis. Though the relationship between vascular and bone 
homeostasis has been recognized recently, the role of vascular endothelial cell 
(EC)-secreted exosomes (EC-Exos) in bone homeostasis is not well understood. 
Herein, we found that EC-Exos show more efficient bone targeting than 
osteoblast-derived exosomes or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
exosomes. We also found that EC-Exos can be internalized by bone marrow-derived 
macrophages (BMMs) to alter their morphology. EC-Exos can inhibit osteoclast 
activity in vitro and inhibit osteoporosis in an ovariectomized mouse model. 
Sequencing of exosome miRNA revealed that miR-155 was highly expressed in 
EC-Exos-treated BMMs. The miR-155 level in EC-Exos was much higher than that in 
BMMs and ECs, indicating that miR-155 was endogenous cargo of EC-derived 
vesicles. Blockage of BMMs miR-155 levels reversed the suppression by EC-Exos of 
osteoclast induction, confirming that exosomal miR-155 may have therapeutic 
potential against osteoporosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that 
EC-Exos may be utilized as a bone targeting and nontoxic nanomedicine for the 
treatment of bone resorption disorders.

Comprehensive identification of antigens in immune complexes (IC-antigens) is 
beneficial to provide insights into pathophysiology and could form the basis for 
novel diagnostic and treatment strategies for many immune-related diseases. 
Immune complexome analysis is a method for comprehensively identifying and 
profiling IC-antigens in biological fluids (such as serum and cerebrospinal 
fluid). We applied this strategy to the analysis of circulating ICs in 
autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic 
scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus), infectious diseases, and 
cancers. Fluorogenic derivatization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (FD-LC-MS/MS) consists of fluorogenic derivatization of proteins, 
followed by HPLC of the derivatized proteins, isolation of the proteins 
differentially expressed in a certain group, enzymatic digestion of the isolated 
proteins followed by LC-tandem MS using a database-searching algorithm for 
protein identification. We have applied this method to understand the 
cardioprotective effect of pre-administration of docetaxel in 
adriamycin/docetaxel combination anti-cancer therapy, and the cellular processes 
that are affected by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in mouse 
stomach tissue during ulcer formation.

AIMS: The myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is almost inevitable 
since reperfusion is the only established treatment for acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). To date there is no effective strategy available for reducing 
the I/R injury. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying myocardial 
I/R injury and to develop a new strategy for attenuating the damage it causes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a mouse model established by ligation of left 
anterior descending artery, we found an increase in activity of protein tyrosine 
phosphatases (PTPs) in myocardium during I/R. Treating the I/R-mice with a 
pan-PTP inhibitor phenyl vinyl sulfone attenuated I/R damage, suggesting PTP 
activation to be harmful in I/R. Through analysing RNAseq data, we showed PTPs 
being abundantly expressed in mouse myocardium. By exposing primary 
cardiomyocytes ablated with specific endogenous PTPs by RNAi to 
hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), we found a role that PTP-PEST (PTPN12) plays to 
promote cell death under H/R stress. Auranofin, a drug being used in clinical 
practice for treating rheumatoid arthritis, may target PTP-PEST thus suppressing 
its activity. We elucidated the molecular basis for Auranofin-induced 
inactivation of PTP-PEST by structural studies, and then examined its effect on 
myocardial I/R injury. In the mice receiving Auranofin before reperfusion, 
myocardial PTP activity was suppressed, leading to restored phosphorylation of 
PTP-PEST substrates, including ErbB-2 that maintains the survival signalling of 
the heart. In line with the inhibition of PTP-PEST activity, the 
Auranofin-treated I/R-mice had smaller infarct size and better cardiac function.
CONCLUSIONS: PTP-PEST contributes to part of the damages resulting from 
myocardial I/R. The drug Auranofin, potentially acting through the 
PTP-PEST-ErbB-2 signalling axis, reduces myocardial I/R injury. Based on this 
finding, Auranofin could be used in the development of new treatments that 
manage I/R injury in patients with AMI.

Previous studies have reported the up-regulation of the two-pore domain K+ 
channel K2P5.1 in the CD4+ T cells of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). However, the mechanisms underlying this up-regulation remain 
unclear. Inflammation-associated hypoxia is involved in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune diseases, such as IBD, MS, and RA, and T cells are exposed to a 
hypoxic environment during their recruitment from inflamed tissues to secondary 
lymphoid tissues. We herein investigated whether inflammation-associated hypoxia 
is attributable to the increased expression and activity of K2P5.1 in the 
splenic CD4+ T cells of chemically-induced IBD model mice. Significant increases 
in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α transcripts and proteins were found in the 
splenic CD4+ T cells of the IBD model. In the activated splenic CD4+ T cells, 
hypoxia (1.5% O2) increased K2P5.1 expression and activity, whereas a treatment 
with the HIF inhibitor FM19G11 but not the selective HIF-2 inhibitor exerted the 
opposite effect. Hypoxia-exposed K2P5.1 up-regulation was also detected in 
stimulated thymocytes and the mouse T-cell line. The class III histone 
deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a downstream molecule of HIF-1α signaling. We 
examined the effects of the SIRT1 inhibitor NCO-01 on K2P5.1 transcription in 
activated CD4+ T cells, and we found no significant effects on the K2P5.1 
transcription. No acute compensatory responses of K2P3.1-K2P5.1 up-regulation 
were found in the CD4+ T cells of the IBD model and the hypoxia-exposed T cells. 
Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism for K2P5.1 up-regulation via 
HIF-1 in the CD4+ T cells of the IBD model.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease 
which leads to bone and cartilage erosion. Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines plays crucial role in the pathophysiology of RA. Cinnamaldehyde and 
eugenol have a long history of medical use in various inflammatory disorders.
PURPOSE: The drugs available for the treatment of RA are associated with various 
side effects. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-arthritic 
effects of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol in rat model of arthritis.
METHODS: Type II collagen was intradermally injected to rats for the induction 
of arthritis. Cinnamaldehyde (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) and eugenol (10 and 
20 mg/kg/day) were given orally for 15 days, starting from day 21 to 35. 
Dexamethasone treated rats served as positive control. Histological, 
radiological and scanning electron microscopic analysis were done to monitor the 
effect of compounds on collagen induced arthritis (CIA). Reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) formation, nitric oxide and antioxidant status were also determined. The 
markers of biomolecular oxidation (protein, lipid and DNA) and activities of 
enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase 
and glutathione reductase) were also evaluated in the joint homogenate and 
plasma of rats. For detecting inflammation, levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 were 
monitored by ELISA.
RESULTS: Our results showed anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of 
cinnamaldehyde and eugenol in arthritic rats. Scanning electron microscopy, 
histopathological and radiological findings also confirmed the anti-arthritic 
effects of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. Both the compounds were effective in 
bringing significant decrease in the levels of ROS, nitric oxide, markers of 
biomolecular oxidation and increase in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. 
The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 were also ameliorated by cinnamaldehyde and 
eugenol treatment. Between the two phytochemicals used, eugenol was found to be 
more effective than cinnamaldehyde in reducing the severity of arthritis.
CONCLUSION: Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol were effective in ameliorating oxidative 
stress and inflammation in arthritic rats. These findings indicate that 
cinnamaldehdye and eugenol have a great potential to be used as an adjunct in 
the management of RA.

Introduction. The hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) play a key role in synovial angiogenesis in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that 
electroacupuncture (EA) may inhibit RA synovial angiogenesis via HIF-1α/VEGF 
expression. Methods. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed to 4 groups: 
control, adjuvant arthritis (AA), AA+electroacupuncture (AA+EA), and AA+sham EA 
groups. AA model was induced by injection of Freund's complete adjuvant in 
bilateral hind footpad. 3 days after injection, EA was delivered to the 
acupoints Zusanli (ST 36) and Xuanzhong (GB 39) once every two days for a total 
of 8 times in the AA+EA group, while sham EA treatment was applied in the 
AA+sham EA group. The arthritis score, paw volume, and H&E staining for each 
animal were measured. CD34 expression in synovial tissue of ankle joint was 
observed by immunohistochemistry. HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA and protein levels in 
synovial tissue were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot, 
respectively. Results. Compared with rats in AA group, EA stimulation 
significantly decreased arthritis scores, paw volume, and pathological damage of 
synovial tissues. Moreover, EA markedly suppressed the synovial angiogenesis of 
AA rats, as evidenced by reduced CD34 positive expression. Furthermore, EA 
significantly reduced HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA and protein levels in synovial of AA 
rats. Finally, the CD34 expression in synovial tissue was positively correlated 
with HIF-1α and VEGF protein levels. Conclusion. EA on ST36 and GB39 acupoints 
can effectively inhibit synovial angiogenesis in the AA rat model via 
downregulating HIF-1α/VEGF expression.

Antidepressants are increasingly recognized to have anti-inflammatory properties 
in addition to their ability to treat major depressive disorders. To explore if 
engagement of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors was required for the 
anti-inflammatory effect of the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin, a series 
of structural derivatives were generated with the aim of reducing 5-HT receptor 
binding. Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to screen 
for anti-inflammatory activity. The lead compound demonstrated a significant 
loss in 5-HT receptor binding, as assessed by non-selective 5-HT binding of 
radiolabelled serotonin in rat cerebral cortex. However, it retained the ability 
to inhibit endosomal toll-like receptor 8 signaling in primary human macrophages 
and spontaneous cytokine production from human rheumatoid synovial tissue 
equivalent to that previously observed for mianserin. These data demonstrate 
that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of mianserin may be independent of 5-HT 
receptor activity. This research offers new insights into the mechanism and 
structural requirements for the anti-inflammatory action of mianserin.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy that principally 
attacks the joints. The present study aimed to explore the potential 
anti-arthritic effects of caffeic acid and ellagic acid in adjuvant-induced 
arthritis, compared to celecoxib. The current study also explored the underlying 
molecular mechanisms e.g., pro-inflammatory signals including chitinase-3-like 
protein-1 (CHI3L1); a glycoprotein that correlates with RA joint destruction 
besides angiogenesis, oxidative stres and apoptosis. Interestingly, caffeic and 
ellagic acids attenuated the severity of arthritis with comparable efficacy to 
celecoxib. Both agents effectively mitigated paw edema and inflammatory cell 
infiltration and protected the joint tissues against pannus formation along with 
cartilage and bone destruction. Notably, they also lowered the paw expression of 
NF-κB and the downstream effector CHI3L1 and its synthesis inducer IL-1β. They 
also lowered the levels of the tissue remodeling factor MMP-9 and the angiogenic 
signal VEGF in rat paws. Both agents also suppressed serum oxidative stress via 
diminishing lipid peroxides and nitric oxide together with augmentation of 
reduced glutathione in arthritic animals. Regarding apoptosis, they attenuated 
paw caspase-3 levels, favoring cell survival. Together, these favorable findings 
may advocate the use of caffeic and ellagic acids as adjunct modalities for the 
management of RA to mitigate joint damage.

BACKGROUND: The current study was intended to investigate the effect of ketamine 
(KET) on complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in rats.
METHODS: The CFA was administered in the hind paw of the rats for the induction 
of adjuvant-induced arthritis. The paw swelling of experimental animals was 
measured as hind paw volume. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was estimated and 
pathological changes in the joint tissues were observed under a light 
microscope. Furthermore, the bicinchoninic acid assay was used for protein 
quantification. The antibody-reactive bands were visualized using enhanced 
chemiluminescence.
RESULTS: The present study showed that KET significantly reduces the severity of 
arthritis in CFA mice. The therapeutic effects were linked with reduced joint 
swelling and destruction, as evidenced by analyzing rat paws. The KET also 
revealed to attenuate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6). In western blot analysis, KET inhibit phosphorylation of MAPKs, 
IκBα and nuclear translocation NF-κB in the inflammatory joints of AIA rats. 
Moreover, KET showed to induce apoptosis via mitochondrial signalling pathways 
(Bcl2, Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caapse-9).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, KET show significant anti-rheumatoid arthritis 
activity via multiple mechanisms and may thus have therapeutic benefits for RA.

BACKGROUND: Sialic acids (SIAs), for example, α2,6-SIAs, can link to conserved 
N-glycans of immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this study, we investigated the 
correlation between α2,6-SIA on IgG and IgM and the disease activity of 
arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in mice.
METHODS: We measured α2,6-SIA levels in IgGs and IgMs in collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). Additionally, α2,6-SIA levels in rheumatoid factors (RFs) and 
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies in RA patients were 
measured. Correlations between α2,6-SIA on Igs and CIA were analyzed and also in 
RA patients by utilizing the disease activity score 28 (DAS28). The ability to 
differentiate RA progression by Ig and autoantibody α2,6-SIA levels was 
examined.
RESULTS: In CIA mice, plasma IgG-α2,6-SIA/IgG ratios decreased, whereas plasma 
IgM-α2,6-SIA/IgM ratios increased. Moreover, arthritis was not observed in 
collagen-injected mice with decreased IgG-α2,6-SIA/IgG ratios and without 
increased IgM-α2,6-SIA/IgM ratios. Isolated IgG-α2,6-SIA/IgG ratios displayed a 
significant inverse correlation with DAS28 scores (r = -0.383, p = 0.037). In 
contrast, isolated IgM-α2,6-SIA/IgM ratios correlated positively with DAS28 (r = 
0.351, p = 0.009). Isolated IgG-anti-CCP-α2,6-SIA/plasma IgG-anti-CCP ratios 
were differentiated into either the remission (higher ratios) or the 
nonremission (lower ratios) category (p = 0.061), which is similar to the 
pattern for C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.041) but different from that for the 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p = 0.421). Using multiple linear 
regression analysis, plasma IgMRF-α2,6-SIA/IgMRF ratios displayed a correlation 
with DAS28 (p = 0.006), which was also observed in the ESR (p = 0.005), but was 
different from that for CRP (p = 0.222).
CONCLUSION: Concurrent reverse expression of α2,6-SIA ratios on IgM and IgG 
correlated with the occurrence of CIA and RA disease activity. Thus, α2,6-SIA 
ratios on IgG-anti-CCP antibodies and IgMRF are potential markers for evaluating 
RA disease activities.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wang-bi tablet (WB) consists of 17 traditional 
Chinese medicines and has been used for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
China for many years, however, its pharmacologic mechanism is not clear.
AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of 
WB on collagen-induced mouse arthritis and explored the underlying mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DBA/1 mice were used to establish a type II 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. From the day of arthritis onset, mice 
were treated daily by gavage with either total glucosides of paeony (TGP, 
0.37  g/kg/d) or WB at a lower (1.11  g/kg/d, WBL) or higher dose of 
(3.33  g/kg/d, WBH) for 8 weeks. The severity of arthritis, levels of cytokines 
and the activation of signaling pathways were determined.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that WB treatment effectively alleviated 
inflammatory symptoms and prevented bone erosions and joint destructions. It 
obviously decreased the serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, 
IL-6 and IL-17α, while increased the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-10. Interestingly, the proportion of splenic Treg cells were increased 
significantly. In vitro experiments showed that WB inhibited the differentiation 
of osteoclasts. Consistently, the mRNA levels of tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K (CtsK), and the activation of NF-κB and 
JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways in the paws of CIA mice were inhibited by WB 
treatment. On the other hand, up-regulation of osteogenic genes Runx2, Osterix 
mRNA, and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway along with a decreased 
receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) expression were found in 
WB treated mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the therapeutic effect of Wang-bi tablet 
could be attributed to its inhibitory activity on NF-κB and STAT3 signaling 
pathway-mediated osteoclast differentiation, and its enhancement on 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-mediated osteoblast functions.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a cellular sensor of danger signals such as 
extracellular ATP or abnormally accumulating molecules like crystals. Activation 
of NLRP3 by such compounds triggers a sterile inflammatory response that may be 
involved in numerous pathologies including rheumatoid arthritis, 
atherosclerosis, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of 
the mechanisms that govern NLRP3 inflammasome activation is an important step 
toward the development of novel therapeutic strategies to dampen over-activation 
of the immune system. Recent findings demonstrate that ligand-activated nuclear 
receptors regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, thus representing possible 
therapeutic targets. It is therefore important to assess the potential of these 
putative targets in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the 
most appropriate pathophysiological models. Fulminant hepatitis (FH) results 
from massive hepatocyte apoptosis, hemorrhagic necrosis, and inflammation. Low 
doses of LPS in combination with the specific hepatotoxic agent D-galactosamine 
(D-GalN) promote liver injury in mice and induce the production of inflammatory 
cytokines associated with increased NLRP3 protein and caspase 1 activity, thus 
recapitulating the clinical picture of FH in humans. We provide a simple method 
to examine the involvement of nuclear receptors in NLRP3-driven fulminant 
hepatitis, consisting in the induction of FH, in the isolation of liver 
macrophages, and in the extraction and analysis of RNA content.

C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is involved in several intractable 
disease processes, including HIV infection, cancer cell metastasis, leukemia 
cell progression, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, 
CXCR4 represents a promising drug target and several CXCR4 antagonizing agents 
are in preclinical or clinical development. Important parameters in drug lead 
evaluation are determination of binding affinities to the receptor and 
assessment of their stability and activity in plasma or blood of animals and 
humans. Here, we designed a microtiter plate-based CXCR4 antibody competition 
assay that enables to measure inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) and 
affinity constants (Ki values) of CXCR4 targeting drugs. The assay is based on 
the observation that most if not all CXCR4 antagonists compete with binding of 
the fluorescence-tagged CXCR4 antibody 12G5 to the receptor. We demonstrate that 
this antibody-competition assay allows a convenient and cheap determination of 
binding affinities of various CXCR4 antagonists in living cells within just 3 h. 
Moreover, the assay can be performed in the presence of high concentrations of 
physiologically relevant body fluids, and thus is a useful readout to evaluate 
stability (i.e. half-life) of CXCR4 ligands in serum/plasma, and even whole 
human and mouse blood ex vivo. Thus, this optimized 12G5 antibody-competition 
assay allows a robust and convenient determination and calculation of various 
important pharmacological parameters of CXCR4 receptor-drug interaction and may 
not only foster future drug development but also animal welfare by reducing the 
number of experimental animals.

The identification of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand 
(RANKL) and its cognate receptor Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B 
(RANK) during a search for novel tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 
superfamily members has dramatically changed the scenario of bone biology by 
providing the functional and biochemical proof that RANKL signaling via RANK is 
the master factor for osteoclastogenesis. In parallel, two independent studies 
reported the identification of mouse RANKL on activated T cells and of a ligand 
for osteoprotegerin on a murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line. After 
these seminal findings, accumulating data indicated RANKL and RANK not only as 
essential players for the development and activation of osteoclasts, but also 
for the correct differentiation of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) 
that act as mediators of the central tolerance process by which self-reactive T 
cells are eliminated while regulatory T cells are generated. In light of the 
RANKL-RANK multi-task function, an antibody targeting this pathway, denosumab, 
is now commonly used in the therapy of bone loss diseases including chronic 
inflammatory bone disorders and osteolytic bone metastases; furthermore, 
preclinical data support the therapeutic application of denosumab in the 
framework of a broader spectrum of tumors. Here, we discuss advances in cellular 
and molecular mechanisms elicited by RANKL-RANK pathway in the bone and thymus, 
and the extent to which its inhibition or augmentation can be translated in the 
clinical arena.

The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue fluid 
homeostasis and the immunological response to inflammation. The effects of 
lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well studied. Here 
we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+ /podoplanin 
(PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with 
accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis 
models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced 
periodontitis. Further, PDPN+ /alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)- lymphatic 
capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+ /αSMA+ collecting LVs are decreased 
significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of 
periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased 
TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the 
local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth 
factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the 
area and number of PDPN+ /αSMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic 
drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. 
Lastly, LYVE1+ /αSMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+ /αSMA+ 
collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with 
chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls. Thus, 
our findings reveal an important role of local lymphatic drainage in periodontal 
inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great

BACKGROUND: Kan-Lu-Hsiao-Tu-Tan (KLHTT) exhibits anti-psoriatic effects through 
anti-inflammatory activity in mice. However, the therapeutic effects of KLHTT on 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), another significant autoimmune inflammatory disorder, 
have not been elucidated. Herein, we explored the anti-arthritic effects of 
KLHTT on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.
METHODS: KLHTT was extracted by boiling water and subjected to spectroscopic 
analysis. Chicken collagen type II (CII) with complete Freund's adjuvant was 
intradermally injected to induce CIA in DBA/1J mice. Anti-CII antibody, 
cytokines, malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were measured 
using ELISA, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and a hydrogen peroxide 
assay kit. Splenocyte proliferation was tested using thymidine incorporation. 
Th1 and Th17 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Oral KLHTT treatment (50 and 100 mg/kg) ameliorated mouse CIA by 
decreasing the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and tumour necrosis 
factor-α in the paw homogenates and serum. KLHTT also suppressed anti-CII 
antibody formation, splenocyte proliferation, and splenic Th1 and Th17 cell 
numbers. Additionally, KLHTT showed antioxidant activity by reducing the 
concentrations of MDA and H2O2 in paw tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effects of KLHTT in CIA mice were through 
regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Our results suggest that 
KLHTT has potential to treat RA.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacological mechanism of Wang-Bi tablets 
(WBTs), a Chinese patented medicine, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using mice 
with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: A mouse model of CIA was induced using bovine type Ⅱ collagen. WBT 
treatment was administered and efficacy was evaluated. The levels of 
interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were 
examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the proportions of Th1 
and Th2 were detected using flow cytometry. T-bet and GATA-binding protein 3 
(GATA3) expression were demonstrated using Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Paw swelling and the arthritis index decreased significantly following 
WBT treatment. Histopathological analysis revealed markedly alleviated damage to 
synovium tissue in the WBT and methotrexate treatment groups. WBT regulated the 
production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4 and modulated Th1 and Th2 cell populations, 
which might have been induced by the attenuation of Th1 and Th2 cell 
differentiation through a decrease in the expression of T-bet and an increase in 
the expression of GATA3 in the synovial tissue in CIA mice.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that WBT may produce a therapeutic effect on 
CIA through maintaining the balance of Th1/Th2 cells, which could result in a 
decrease in the autoinflammatory disorder observed in RA.

BACKGROUND: Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) facilitates 
differentiation of osteoclast precursors into osteoclasts, resulting in bone 
erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLS) are the main cells for producing RANKL. Signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is activated in FLS of RA patients (RA-FLS), 
which has been linked to RANKL production. A two-herb formula (RL) comprising 
Rosae Multiflorae Fructus and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos is traditionally used for 
treating RA in China. We have found that a standardized ethanolic extract of RL 
(RLE for short) alleviates bone erosion in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
rats.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine whether RLE inhibits RANKL production and 
osteoclastogenesis in cell and rat models, and to explore the involvement of the 
STAT3 pathway in this inhibition.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A CIA rat model, interleukin-6/soluble interleukin-6 
receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R)-stimulated RA-FLS and a co-culture system 
(IL-6/sIL-6R-stimulated RA-FLS/peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were used to 
evaluate the effects of RLE. Micro-computed tomography analysis was used to 
observe bone erosion in CIA rats. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining 
was used to evaluate osteoclastogenesis. Western blotting and ELISA assays were 
employed to examine protein levels. RT-qPCR was used to detect mRNA levels. 
STAT3-over-activated RA-FLS were used to investigate the involvement of STAT3 
signaling in the anti-osteoclastogenic effects of RLE.
RESULTS: RLE alleviated bone erosion in joints of CIA rats. In both synovial 
tissues of CIA rats and IL-6/sIL-6R-stimulated RA-FLS, RLE downregulated the 
protein level of RANKL. In the co-culture system, RLE significantly and 
dose-dependently inhibited IL-6/sIL-6R-induced osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistic 
studies revealed that RLE lowered the protein level of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) in 
synovial tissues of CIA rats. In IL-6/sIL-6R-stimulated RA-FLS, RLE inhibited 
the activation/phosphorylation of a STAT3 upstream kinase Janus kinase 2 
(Tyr1007/1008) and STAT3 (Tyr705), decreased the nuclear localization of STAT3, 
lowered mRNA levels of STAT3-transcriptionally regulated genes IL-1β and TNF-α. 
RLE's inhibitory effects on RANKL production in RA-FLS gradually decreased when 
IL-6/sIL-6R doses increased. Over-activation of STAT3 diminished the inhibitory 
effects of RLE on RANKL production in IL-6/sIL-6R-stimulated RA-FLS, and 
attenuated the anti-osteoclastogenic effects of RLE in the co-culture system.
CONCLUSION: We, for the first time, demonstrated that suppressing STAT3 
signaling contributes to the inhibition of RANKL production and 
osteoclastogenesis, and thereby supports the mechanisms responsible for the 
reduction in bone erosion in RLE-treated CIA rats. This study provides further 
pharmacological groundwork for developing RLE as a modern anti-arthritic drug, 
and supports the notion that targeting STAT3 signaling is a viable strategy for 
managing bone erosion.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the participation of canonical Wnt and NF-κB signaling 
pathways in an experimental model of chronic arthritis induced by methylated 
bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in rat temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were sensitized by mBSA+Complete Freund 
Adjuvant (CFA)/Incomplete Freund Adjuvant (IFA) on the first 14 days (1 ×/week). 
Subsequently, they received 1, 2 or 3 mBSA or saline solution injections into 
the TMJ (1 ×/week). Hypernociceptive threshold was assessed during the whole 
experimental period. 24 h after the mBSA injections, the TMJs were removed for 
histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses for TNF-α, IL-1β, NF-κB, 
RANKL, Wnt-10b, β-catenin and DKK1.
RESULTS: The nociceptive threshold was significantly reduced after mBSA 
injections. An inflammatory infiltrate and thickening of the synovial membrane 
were observed only after mBSA booster injections. Immunolabeling of TNF-α, IL-1β 
and Wnt-10b was increased in the synovial membrane in arthritic groups. The 
immunoexpression of nuclear β-catenin was significantly higher only in the group 
that received 2 booster TMJ injections. However, NF-κB, RANKL and DKK1 
immunoexpression were increased only in animals with 3 mBSA intra-articular 
injections.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that canonical Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways 
participate in the hypernociception and inflammatory response in TMJ synovial 
membrane during the development of rheumatoid arthritis in rats.

The present study was to demonstrate that the G protein coupled receptors serve 
as targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis 
and multiple sclerosis. Rats received pristane at the base of the tail. Affected 
joints were counted daily. The T cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as 
pristine-induced arthritis (PIA) and autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in a rat 
model were profoundly ameliorated by treatment with the specific G protein 
couple receptors 120 (GPR120) stimuli omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs). Our study 
further revealed that the activation of GPR120 by ω-3 FAs can result in a 
decrease of phosphorylated transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 
(TAK1), and further inhibit the downstream IKKβ/I-κB pathway and the terminal 
NF-κB activation which serves as a mediator of T cell activation. ω-3 Fatty 
acids exhibited an inhibitory effect on TAK1 by enhancing the association of 
β-arrestin2 and TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1), thus the disassociation of TAB1 
from the TAB1/TAK1 complex renders a limited effect on β-arrestin2 signaling as 
an innate immunity regulation. GPR120 is a functional receptor of ω-3 fatty 
acids in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease compared with its effect on innate 
immunity.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious and fatal lung disease, with a 
median survival of only 3-5 years from diagnosis. Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) has a 
well-established role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, 
including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune-related pulmonary fibrosis. 
In this study, through the use of a conformationally-constrained design 
strategy, a series of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines were synthesized as potent JAK3 
inhibitors for the treatment of IPF. Among them, the most potent JAK3 inhibitor, 
namely 8e (IC50 = 1.38 nM), significantly reduced the degree of airsacculitis 
and fibrosis according to hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining assay for the lung 
tissue in the bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. The clear 
reduction of the lung collagen deposition by the determination of Masson and 
hydroxyproline (HYP) content also demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of 
fibrosis. In addition, 8e also reduced the expression of the inflammatory 
markers IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-α and malondialdehyde (MDA) in lung tissue, which 
indicated its higher anti-inflammatory activity compared with that of the 
reference agents (nintedanib and gefitinib). Furthermore, it possessed low 
cytotoxicity against normal human bronchial epithelia (HBE) cells 
(IC50 > 39.0 μM) and C57BL mice. All these evaluated biological properties

Immunological memory ensures life-long protection against previously encountered 
pathogens, and in mice and humans the spleen is an important reservoir for 
long-lived memory B cells (MBCs). It is well-established that integrins play 
several crucial roles in lymphocyte survival and trafficking, but their 
involvement in the retention of MBCs in secondary lymphoid organs, and 
differences between B cell subsets in their adhesion capacity to ICAM-1 and/or 
VCAM-1 have not yet been confirmed. Here, we use an autoimmune mouse model, 
where MBCs are abundant, to show that the highest levels of LFA-1 and VLA-4 
amongst B cells are found on MBCs. In vivo blockade of VLA-4 alone or in 
combination with LFA-1, but not LFA-1 alone, causes a release of MBCs from the 
spleen into the blood stream. In humans, we find that in peripheral blood, 
spleens, and tonsils from healthy donors the highest expression levels of the 
integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 are also found on MBCs. Consistent with this, we found 
MBCs to have a higher capacity to adhere to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 than naïve B 
cells. In patients with the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis, it is the 
MBCs that have the highest levels of LFA-1 and VLA-4; moreover, compared with 
healthy donors, naïve B and MBCs of patients receiving anti-TNF medication have 
enhanced levels of the active form of LFA-1. Commensurate levels of the active 
αL subunit can be induced on B cells from healthy donors by exposure to the 
integrin ligands. Thus, our findings establish the selective use of the 
integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 in the localization and adhesion of MBCs in both mice 
and humans.

During T cell development in mice, thymic negative selection deletes cells with 
the potential to recognize and react to self-antigens. In human T cell-dependent 
autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid 
arthritis, T cells reactive to autoantigens are thought to escape negative 
selection, traffic to the periphery and attack self-tissues. However, 
physiological thymic negative selection of autoreactive human T cells has not 
been previously studied. We now describe a human T-cell receptor-transgenic 
humanized mouse model that permits the study of autoreactive T-cell development 
in a human thymus. Our studies demonstrate that thymocytes expressing the 
autoreactive Clone 5 TCR, which recognizes insulin B:9-23 presented by HLA-DQ8, 
are efficiently negatively selected at the double and single positive stage in 
human immune systems derived from HLA-DQ8+ HSCs. In the absence of hematopoietic 
expression of the HLA restriction element, negative selection of Clone 5 is less 
efficient and restricted to the single positive stage. To our knowledge, these 
data provide the first demonstration of negative selection of human T cells 
recognizing a naturally-expressed tissue-restricted antigen. Intrathymic antigen 
presenting cells are required to delete less mature thymocytes, while 
presentation by medullary thymic epithelial cells may be sufficient to delete 
more mature single positive cells. These observations set the stage for 
investigation of putative defects in negative selection in human autoimmune 
diseases.

Rheumatoid arthritis-associated pain is poorly managed, often persisting when 
joint inflammation is pharmacologically controlled. Comparably, in the mouse 
K/BxN serum-transfer model of inflammatory arthritis, hind-paw nociceptive 
hypersensitivity occurs with ankle joint swelling (5 days post-immunisation) 
persisting after swelling has resolved (25 days post-immunisation). In this 
study, lipid mediator profiling of lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the site of 
sensory neuron cell bodies innervating the ankle joints, 5 days and 25 days 
after serum transfer demonstrated a shift in specialised pro-resolving lipid 
mediator (SPM) profiles. Persistent nociception without joint swelling was 
associated with low concentrations of the SPM Maresin-1 (MaR1) and high 
macrophage numbers in DRG. MaR1 application to cultured DRG neurons inhibited 
both capsaicin-induced increase of intracellular calcium ions and release of 
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 
in peritoneal macrophages challenged with lipopolysaccharide, MaR1 reduced 
pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Systemic MaR1 administration caused 
sustained reversal of nociceptive hypersensitivity and reduced inflammatory 
macrophage numbers in DRG. Unlike gabapentin, which was used as positive 
control, systemic MaR1 did not display acute anti-hyperalgesic action. 
Therefore, these data suggest that MaR1 effects observed following K/BxN serum 
transfer relate to modulation of macrophage recruitment, more likely than to 
direct actions on sensory neurons. Our study highlights that, in DRG, aberrant 
pro-resolution mechanisms play a key role in arthritis joint pain dissociated 
from joint swelling, opening novel approaches for RA pain treatment.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a type of systemic autoimmune arthritis that causes 
joint inflammation and destruction. One of the pathological mechanisms of RA is 
known to involve histone acetylation. Although the histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) can attenuate arthritis in 
animal models of RA, the mechanism underlying this effect is poorly understood. 
This study was performed to examine whether SAHA has therapeutic potential in an 
animal model of RA and to investigate its mechanism of action. Collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mice were orally administered SAHA daily for 8 weeks and 
examined for their arthritis score and incidence of arthritis. CD4+ T cell 
regulation following SAHA treatment was confirmed in splenocytes cultured under 
type 17 helper T (Th17) cell differentiation conditions. Clinical scores and the 
incidence of CIA were lower in mice in the SAHA treatment group compared to the 
controls. In addition, SAHA inhibited Th17 cell differentiation, as well as 
decreased expression of the Th17 cell-related transcription factors pSTAT3 Y705 
and pSTAT3 S727. In vitro experiments showed that SAHA maintained regulatory T 
(Treg) cells but specifically reduced Th17 cells. The same results were obtained 
when mouse splenocytes were cultured under Treg cell differentiation conditions 
and then converted to Th17 cell differentiation conditions. In conclusion, SAHA 
was confirmed to specifically inhibit Th17 cell differentiation through nuclear 
receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1), a factor associated with Th17 
differentiation. The results of the present study suggested that SAHA can 
attenuate CIA development by inhibition of the Th17 population and maintenance 
of the Treg population through NR1D1 inhibition. Therefore, SAHA is a potential 
therapeutic candidate for RA.

Flaccidoside II (FLA II), the primary active constituent from Anemone flaccida 
rhizome, was proven to exert therapeutic effect against collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA). In this study, a research based on the CIA mouse model was 
carried out in order to elucidate its therapeutic mechanisms preliminarily. The 
mice were immunized with porcine type-II collagen to induce CIA and 
administrated intragastrically with FLA II daily from day 7-42 of the first 
collagen immunization. The arthritis scores as reflected by the severity of paw 
swelling and erythema were significantly reduced in FLA II (32 mg/kg) from day 
33 onwards. On day 42, the joints of FLA II-treated mice exhibited obvious 
reductions of inflammatory cells infiltration, synovial hyperplasia and bone 
destruction. When the concentration of FLA II was no less than 40 nmol/ml, the 
treatment notably inhibited T and B lymphocyte proliferative responses. As 
compared to the model group, in FLA II groups, the serum levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were significantly decreased 
while those of Th2 type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were clearly enhanced. In 
addition, FLA II treatment showed little regulatory effect on the levels of Th1 
type cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-2). The severity of mice CIA was improved by FLA 
II, further confirming its potential value for the safe treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis. The main mechanisms likely involve the inhibition of lymphocyte 
proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and the modulation of 
Th1/Th2-related cytokine balance in CIA.

Interference with immune cell proliferation represents a successful treatment 
strategy in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
multiple sclerosis (MS). One prominent example is pharmacological inhibition of 
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which mediates de novo pyrimidine 
synthesis in actively proliferating T and B lymphocytes. Within the TERIDYNAMIC 
clinical study, we observed that the DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide caused 
selective changes in T cell subset composition and T cell receptor repertoire 
diversity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In a preclinical 
antigen-specific setup, DHODH inhibition preferentially suppressed the 
proliferation of high-affinity T cells. Mechanistically, DHODH inhibition 
interferes with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and aerobic glycolysis in 
activated T cells via functional inhibition of complex III of the respiratory 
chain. The affinity-dependent effects of DHODH inhibition were closely linked to 
differences in T cell metabolism. High-affinity T cells preferentially use 
OXPHOS during early activation, which explains their increased susceptibility 
toward DHODH inhibition. In a mouse model of MS, DHODH inhibitory treatment 
resulted in preferential inhibition of high-affinity autoreactive T cell clones. 
Compared to T cells from healthy controls, T cells from patients with RRMS 
exhibited increased OXPHOS and glycolysis, which were reduced with teriflunomide 
treatment. Together, these data point to a mechanism of action where DHODH 
inhibition corrects metabolic disturbances in T cells, which primarily affects 
profoundly metabolically active high-affinity T cell clones. Hence, DHODH 
inhibition may promote recovery of an altered T cell receptor repertoire in 
autoimmunity.

Iron homeostasis is essential for health; moreover, hepcidin-deficiency results 
in iron overload in both hereditary hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemia. 
Here, we identified iron modulators by functionally screening hepcidin agonists 
using a library of 640 FDA-approved drugs in human hepatic Huh7 cells. We 
validated the results in C57BL/6J mice and a mouse model of hemochromatosis 
(Hfe-/- mice). Our screen revealed that the anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug 
auranofin (AUR) potently upregulates hepcidin expression. Interestingly, we 
found that canonical signaling pathways that regulate iron, including the 
Bmp/Smad and IL-6/Jak2/Stat3 pathways, play indispensable roles in mediating 
AUR's effects. In addition, AUR induces IL-6 via the NF-κB pathway. In C57BL/6J 
mice, acute treatment with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin signaling 
and decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation. Whereas chronically 
treating male Hfe-/- mice with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin 
signaling, decreasing systemic iron overload, but less effective in females. 
Further analyses revealed that estrogen reduced the ability of AUR to induce 
IL-6/hepcidin signaling in Huh7 cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for 
ineffectiveness of AUR in female Hfe-/- mice. Notably, high-dose AUR (25 mg/kg) 
induces ferroptosis and causes lipid peroxidation through inhibition of 
thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) activity. We demonstrate the ferroptosis inhibitor 
ferrostatin significantly protects liver toxicity induced by high-dose AUR 
without comprising its beneficial effect on iron metabolism. In conclusion, our 
findings provide compelling evidence that TXNRD is a key regulator of 
ferroptosis, and AUR is a novel activator of hepcidin and ferroptosis via 
distinct mechanisms, suggesting a promising approach for treating 
hemochromatosis and hepcidin-deficiency related disorders.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Osteoporosis is a worldwide epidemic but pharmacological 
agents to stimulate new bone formation are scarce. We have shown that increasing 
tissue levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) by blocking its degradation by 
the S1P lyase has pronounced osteoanabolic effect in mouse osteoporosis models 
by stimulating osteoblast differentiation through the S1P receptor 2 (S1P2). 
However, S1P lyase inhibitors have side effects complicating potential clinical 
use. Here, we tested whether direct S1P2 engagement by the S1P2 agonist CYM5520 
exerted osteoanabolic potential in estrogen deficiency-induced osteopenia in 
mice. We compared its efficacy to LX2931, a novel S1P lyase inhibitor currently 
tested in rheumatoid arthritis.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: CYM5520, LX2931 or vehicle were administered to 
ovariectomized mice for 6 weeks beginning 5 weeks after ovariectomy, Bone mass, 
cellular composition and mechanical strength were assessed by microCT, 
histomorphometry and three point bending tests. Plasma markers of bone 
metabolism were analyzed by ELISA.
KEY RESULTS: Therapeutic treatment with CYM5520 and LX2931 clearly increased 
long bone and vertebral bone mass to impressive 3-5 fold over vehicle in 
osteopenic ovariectomized mice. As expected, lymphopenia was a side effect of 
LX2931, whereas none occurred with CYM5520. Consistent with an osteoanabolic 
effect, CYM5520 increased osteoblast number, osteoid surface and alkaline 
phosphatase area 2-3 fold over vehicle. Plasma concentrations of the 
osteoanabolic marker procollagen I C-terminal propeptide were also elevated by 
CYM5520 and LX2931. LX2931 but not yet CYM5520 increased cortical thickness and 
mechanical strength without affecting mineral density.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Treatment with a pharmacological S1P2 agonist 
corrected ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in mice by inducing new bone formation 
thus constituting a novel osteoanabolic approach to osteoporosis.

The dry rhizome of Acorus gramineus Solander, known as Acori Graminei Rhizoma, 
is used to treat dementia, stroke, eczema, and indigestion in traditional 
Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, and traditional Japanese Kampo 
medicine. Previous studies have reported that Acori Graminei Rhizoma extract 
ameliorated cognitive impairment in Aβ1-42 injected mice. However, the effect of 
Acori Graminei Rhizoma on type II collagen induced arthritis (CIA) has not been 
elucidated. Thus, we evaluated the water extract of Acori Graminei Rhizoma (WAG) 
in CIA mice models. Male DBA/1 mice were separated into five groups (NOR; n=10, 
CON; n=10, CIA + methotrexate (MTX); n=10, CIA + 100 mg/kg WAG; n=10, CIA + 
500 mg/kg WAG; n=10). CIA was induced by injecting the mice with bovine type II 
collagen, after which the mice were treated with WAG and/or MTX. Hematological 
parameters and liver and kidney serum toxicity markers were analyzed. Further, 
serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, and type II collagen IgG were 
analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment with 500 mg/kg 
WAG decreased serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and collagen IgG in a CIA model. 
Moreover, WAG treatment decreased CIA-induced swelling of mouse hind legs, 
infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial membrane, and blood 
neutrophil levels. WAG administration did not influence hematological parameters 
or kidneys and liver toxicity markers. WAG may be used to treat arthritis by 
reducing the inflammation indicators. However, further experiments are required 
to determine how WAG affects inflammation mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is 
produced by many cell types in situations of homeostasis or disease. One of its 
functions is to act as a proinflammatory molecule. In humans, several studies 
have shown that MIF levels become elevated in the serum, urine, cerebrospinal 
fluid and tissues of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (systemic lupus 
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, sepsis, atheromas, 
diabetes and cancer). In dogs, distemper is a viral infectious condition that 
may lead to demyelination and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). 
In addition to the action of the virus, the inflammatory process may give rise 
to lesions in the white matter. Therefore, the objectives of the present study 
were to evaluate the role of MIF in the encephalitis that the canine distemper 
virus causes and to compare this with immunodetection of major 
histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II), CD3 T lymphocytes, MMP-9 and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocytes) in demyelinated areas of the 
encephalon, in order to ascertain whether these findings might be related to the 
severity of the encephalic lesions. To this end, a retrospective study on 
archived paraffinized blocks was conducted, in which 21 encephala from dogs that 
had been naturally infected with the canine distemper virus (infected group) and 
five from dogs that had been free from systemic or CNS-affecting diseases 
(control group) were used. In the immunohistochemical analysis on the samples, 
the degree of marking by GFAP, MHC-II, MMP-9 and MIF was greater in the 
demyelinated areas and in the adjacent neuropil, and this was seen particularly 
in astrocytes. Detection of CD3 was limited to perivascular cuffs. In areas of 
liquefactive necrosis, Gitter cells were positive for MMP-9, MIF and MHC-II. 
Hence, it was concluded that activated astrocytes influenced the afflux of T 
lymphocytes to the encephalon (encephalitis). In the more advanced phases, 
activated phagocytes in the areas of liquefactive necrosis (Gitter cells) 
continued to produce inflammatory mediators even after the astrocytes in these 
localities had died, thereby worsening the encephalic lesions. Distemper 
virus-activated astrocytes and microglia produce MIF that results in 
proinflammatory stimulus on glial cells and brain-infiltrating leukocytes. 
Therefore, the effect of the inflammatory response is potentiated on the 
neuropil, resulting in neurological clinical signs.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory 
disease of joints. Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Family: Meliaceae) is a 
Indian medicinal plant which is traditionally being used to heal inflammation of 
joints.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This work was aimed to carry out chemical standardization, 
in-vitro/in-vivo validation, oral pharmacokinetics and formulation development 
of anti-arthritic botanical lead, the rohitukine-enriched fraction of D. 
binectariferum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rohitukine-enriched fraction of D. binectariferum was 
standardized using four chemical markers and was checked for microbial load, 
heavy metal content, aflatoxins and pesticides. Its in-vitro inhibitory effect 
on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
TNF-α and IL-6 was studied in THP-1 cells. The in-vivo anti-arthritic activity 
was investigated in collagen-induced arthritis model in DBA/1J mice. The 
sustained release capsule formulation was developed and characterized for 
physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.
RESULTS: Rohitukine and schumaniofioside A were found to be major chemical 
constituents of the botanical lead. The rohitukine-enriched fraction of D. 
binectariferum significantly reduced the production of both pro-inflammatory 
cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 (>50% inhibition at 3.12 μg/mL) in THP-1 cells. In 
LPS-treated wild-type mice model, the rohitukine-enriched fraction at 200 mg/kg 
(PO, QD) completely reduced serum TNF-α levels. In transgenic mice model 
(collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice), rohitukine-enriched fraction at 
100 mg/kg (PO, QD) dose has resulted in >75% reduction of TNF-α/IL-6 serum 
levels, 68% reduction in anti-mouse type II collagen IgG1 antibody levels, 
decreased joint proteoglycan loss and reduced paw edema in DBA/1J mice. The 
sustained release capsule formulation of rohitukine-enriched fraction showed 
sustained-release of rohitukine over the period of 24 h, and resulted in an 
improved plasma-exposure of rohitukine in SD rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein demonstrated anti-arthritic potential of 
rohitukine-enriched fraction of D. binectariferum and this study will serve as 
the benchmark for further research on this botanical lead and developed 
sustained release capsule formulation.

Periplocae Cortex, named Xiang-Jia-Pi in China, has been widely used to treat 
autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. However, the in vivo 
substances of Periplocae Cortex remain unknown yet. In this study, an 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry was used for profiling the chemical components and related 
metabolites of Periplocae Cortex. A total of 98 constituents were identified or 
tentatively characterized in Periplocae Cortex: 42 C21 steroidal glycosides, 10 
cardiac glycosides, 23 organic acids, 4 aldehydes, 7 triterpenes, and 12 other 
types. Among them, 18 components were unambiguously identified by comparison 
with reference standards. In addition, 176 related xenobiotics (34 prototypes 
and 142 metabolites) were screened out and characterized in rats' biosamples 
(plasma, urine, bile, and feces) after the oral administration of Periplocae 
Cortex. Moreover, the metabolic fate of periplocoside S-4a, a C21 steroidal 
glycoside, was proposed for the first time. In summary, phase II reactions 
(methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation), phase I reactions (hydrolysis 
reactions, oxygenation, and reduction), and their combinations were the 
predominant metabolic reactions of Periplocae Cortex in rat. It is the first 
report to reveal the in vivo substances and metabolism feature of Periplocae 
Cortex. This study also provided meaningful information for further 
pharmacodynamics study of Periplocae Cortex, as well as its quality control 
research.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a known intractable chronic 
inflammatory disease of synovial joints characterized by hyperplasia and 
consecutive inflammation with a high prevalence.Guizhi-Shaoyao-Zhimu (GSZD) is 
the first choice for clinical treatment of RA in Chinese traditional medicine. 
This study is aimed to explore the possible pharmacological mechanisms of 
anti-arthritic effect of GSZD.
METHODS: Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model was used to study 
the anti-arthritic activity of GSZDin vivo, and toe swelling & arthritis score, 
serum levels of cytokines, and pathological examinations were carried out. In 
vitro, TNF-α induced MH7A cells were used to study the possible mechanisms of 
GSZD. The anti-proliferative effects of GSZD were determined by MMT assay, and 
pro-apoptotic activity of GSZD in MH7A cells was determined by flow cytometry 
analysis & DAPI staining. Furthermore, the adhesive and invasive abilities of 
MH7A cells were determined using cell adhesion and transwell assays. MMPs levels 
were determined by ELISA assays, and mRNA expressions of Caspase-3, -9, Bax, 
SOCS1, Bcl-2, JAK2, STAT-3 and -5 were determined using qRT-PCR analysis. 
Besides, the major chemical components in GSZD were analyzed by HPLC-QqQ-MS 
analysis.
RESULTS: Our results showed GSZD reduced the toe swelling & arthritis score, and 
serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 & IL-17a in CIA rats; pathological 
examination results indicated GSZD improved ankle joint injury in CIA rats.In 
vitro, GSZD showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on 
TNF-α stimulated MH7A cells. After GSZD treatment, the adhesive and invasive 
abilities of MH7A cells were reduced, and secretions of MMPs, IL-6 and IL-8 were 
also reduced. GSZD decreased the releases of TNF-α and IL-1β in LPS stimulated 
RAW 264.7 cells. Further studies showed GSZD up-regulated mRNA expressions of 
Caspase-3, -9, Bax, and SOCS1, whereas down-regulated mRNA expressions of Bcl-2, 
JAK2, STAT3 and STAT5. Besides, 13 major chemical components were identified in 
GSZD extracts through HPLC-QqQ-MS analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested GSZD possesses an anti-rheumatic effect on CIA 
rats, and the possible mechanism is related to inhibiting inflammatory response, 
inhibiting invasion and migration of synovial fibroblasts, and inducing 
apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic articular synovial 
inflammatory disease. The precise etiology underlying the pathogenesis of RA 
remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of curcumin 
analog FM0807 (curcumin salicylate monoester, 2-hydroxy-, 
4-[(1E,6E)-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dioxo-1,6-heptadien-1-yl]-2-methoxyphenyl 
ester) on experimental RA and investigate its possible mechanisms of action.
METHOD: Rats with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritis (AIA) were 
administered aspirin (0.1 mmol.kg-1), curcumin (0.1 mmol.kg-1), FM0807 (0.1, 0.2 
mmol.kg-1) and vehicle via gastric gavage, from days 7 to 21, once daily. The 
hind paw volume and arthritis index (AI) were measured, and radiographic and 
histological examinations were performed. Twenty-one days later, the animals 
were killed and left ankle joints were removed to measure protein expression of 
the elements of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) pathway by Western blot analysis. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) was employed to measure synovial fluid levels of tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10.
RESULTS: Compared with AIA group, FM0807 reduced the AI and swelling of the 
injected hind paw in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibited increases in 
inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation and cartilage destruction. 
FM0807 also potently attenuated the increase in the expression of inflammatory 
factors TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in synovial fluid, while IL-10 levels were also 
elevated. FM0807 significantly suppressed phosphorylation of 
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun-N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) 1/2 (JNK1/2), p38MAPK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK), IκB and 
NF-κB p65 protein, (all P<0.05), which displayed more potential effects compared 
with those of the aspirin and curcumin groups.
CONCLUSION: FM0807 exerts its therapeutic effects on RA by inhibiting cartilage 
degeneration. FM0807 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for 
RA.

CONTENT: Isochlorogenic acid A, one of the main components of Duhaldea nervosa 
(Wallich ex Candolle) A. Anderberg (Asteraceae), is a folk medicine used to 
treat a variety of diseases including fracture and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite 
its widespread use, the metabolism of isochlorogenic acid A in vivo has not been 
fully studied.
OBJECTIVE: An analytical strategy based on UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS is 
proposed for the detection and identification of the metabolites of 
isochlorogenic acid A in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six male Sprague-Dawley rats (180 ± 20 g) were randomly 
divided into two groups. Then, blood and tissue samples were obtained after oral 
administration of isochlorogenic acid A (200 mg/kg). All the samples were 
pre-treated by the Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) method. Next, the samples were 
analysed by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS. Finally, the metabolites were 
identified based on the metabolomic workflow template.
RESULTS: A total of 33 metabolites were identified in rat plasma, with 30 of 
them being reported for the first time. The distribution of all metabolites in 
tissues was first investigated, three of them were widely distributed in liver, 
lungs, and kidneys. The corresponding reactions including methylation, 
hydrolysis, sulphate conjugation, glucuronide conjugation, as well as their 
composite reactions, are reported in this study.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This method has wide-scale application prospects in 
the identification of metabolites. Considering that limited research has been 
conducted in this area, this study proposes metabolic pathways to further 
understand mechanisms of isochlorogenic acid A and the forms that are truly 
effective in vivo.

The ability of rodent immune-mediated arthritis models to quantitatively predict 
therapeutic activity of antiarthritis agents is poorly understood. Two commonly 
used preclinical models of arthritis are adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. The objective of the current study is 
to investigate the relationship between efficacy in AIA and CIA in rats, and 
clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis patients using translational 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis. A range of doses of 
indomethacin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), and three 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), methotrexate, etanercept, and 
tofacitinib, were evaluated in AIA and CIA rats. Dexamethasone was included in 
this study as a positive control. The area under the ankle diameter-time profile 
(AUCankle) and ankle histopathology summed scores (AHSS) were used as efficacy 
endpoints for activity against disease symptoms (joint inflammation) and disease 
progression (joint damage), respectively. Translational PK-PD analysis was 
performed to rank order preclinical efficacy endpoints at clinically relevant 
concentrations. For each drug tested, inhibition of AUCankle and AHSS scores was 
generally comparable in both magnitude and rank order. Overall, based on both 
AUCankle and the AHSS inhibition, the rank ordering of preclinical activity for 
the DMARDs evaluated was tofacitinib > etanercept ≥ methotrexate. This ranking 
of preclinical efficacy was consistent with reported clinical efficacy. Of 
interest, indomethacin showed equal or often better efficacy than the three 
DMARDs evaluated on inhibiting AHSS despite having limited ability to prevent 
joint damage clinically in patients. The translational value of performing PK-PD 
analysis of arthritis models in rats is discussed.

To investigate the crosstalk between cartilage and fibroblast-like synoviocytes 
(FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we adopted an in vitro coculture system 
model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) cartilage and CIA FLS monolayer. CIA 
rat samples of the synovium and femur head were collected for isolation of FLS 
and coculture system. Cartilages were treated with vehicle (Ctrl group), 
10 ng/mL interleukin- (IL-) 1α (IL-1α group), and 10 ng/mL IL-1α plus 10 μM 
dexamethasone (Dex group) for 3 days before coculture with FLS for further 2 
days. After the coculture, FLS were collected to determine the influences of 
articular cartilage on synoviocytes. Whether the CypB-CD147 signaling pathway is 
involved in the interactions between cartilage and FLS is assayed. Results 
showed that IL-1α-stimulated CIA cartilage promoted the proliferation and 
reduced the apoptosis of FLS. Increased inflammatory cytokines and decreased p57 
expression were found in cocultured FLS stimulated by IL-1α-challenged CIA 
cartilage. Upregulation of NF-κB and I-κB kinase β (IKK-β) and downregulation of 
the inhibitor of NF-κBα (I-κBα) protein were observed in cocultured FLS. After 
coculture, significant increases in the expression of cyclophilin B (CypB) and 
CD147 were observed in CIA cartilage and FLS, respectively. Furthermore, results 
of immunofluorescence staining showed that the anti-CD147 antibody significantly 
suppressed p65 nuclear translocation in cocultured FLS stimulated by 
IL-1α-challenged CIA cartilage. In conclusion, inflammatory effects in the 
cartilage-FLS coculture system are associated with the CypB-CD147 mediating 
NF-κB pathway which may further enhance the inflammation in RA.

Inflammatory osteolysis is governed by exacerbated osteoclastogenesis. Ample 
evidence points to central role of NF-κB in such pathologic responses, yet the 
precise mechanisms underpinning specificity of these responses remain unclear. 
We propose that motifs of the scaffold protein IKKγ/NEMO partly facilitate such 
functions. As proof-of-principle, we used site-specific mutagenesis to examine 
the role of NEMO in mediating RANKL-induced signaling in mouse bone marrow 
macrophages, known as osteoclast precursors. We identified lysine (K)270 as a 
target regulating RANKL signaling as K270A substitution results in exuberant 
osteoclastogenesis in vitro and murine inflammatory osteolysis in vivo. 
Mechanistically, we discovered that K270A mutation disrupts autophagy, 
stabilizes NEMO, and elevates inflammatory burden. Specifically, K270A directly 
or indirectly hinders binding of NEMO to ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, which 
we show targets the modified proteins to autophagy-mediated lysosomal 
degradation. Taken together, our findings suggest that NEMO serves as a toolkit 
to fine-tune specific signals in physiologic and pathologic conditions.

Plain Language Summary: The human skeleton contains over 200 bones that together 
act as an internal framework for the body. Over our lifetime, the body 
constantly removes older bone tissue from the skeleton and replaces it with new 
bone tissue. This “bone remodeling” also controls how bones are repaired after 
being damaged by injuries, disease or normal wear and tear. Cells known as 
osteoclasts are responsible for breaking down old bone tissue and participate in 
repairing damaged bone. A cellular pathway known as NF-kB signaling stimulates 
other cells called “bone marrow macrophages” to become osteoclasts. A certain 
level of NF-kB signaling is required to maintain a healthy skeleton. However, 
under certain inflammatory conditions, the level of NF-kB signaling becomes too 
high causing hyperactive osteoclasts to accumulate and inflict severe bone 
breakdown. This abnormal osteoclast activity leads to eroded and fragile bones 
and joints, as is the case in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoporosis. Previous studies have shown that a protein called NEMO is a core 
component of the NF-kB signal pathway, but the precise role of NEMO in the 
diseased response remained unclear. Adapala, Swarnkar, Arra et al. have now used 
site-directed mutagenesis approach to study the role of NEMO in bone marrow 
macrophages in mice. The experiments showed that one specific site within the 
NEMO protein, referred to as lysine 270, is crucial for its role in controlling 
osteoclasts and the breakdown of bone tissue. Mutating NEMO at lysine 270 led to 
uncontrolled NF-kB signaling in the bone marrow macrophages. Further experiments 
showed that lysine 270 served as a sensor to allow NEMO to bind another protein 
called ISG15, which in turn helped to decrease NF-kB signaling and slow down the 
erosion of the bone. These findings suggest that site-specific targeting of 
NEMO, rather than inhibiting the whole NF-kB pathway, may help to reduce the 
symptoms of bone disease while maintaining the beneficial roles of this 
essential pathway. However, additional research is required to identify NEMO 
sites responsible for controlling the inflammatory component.

The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that regulates the 
expression of genes that control cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as 
genes that respond to inflammation and immune responses. There are two means of 
NF-κB activation: the classical pathway, which involves the degradation of the 
inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), and the alternative pathway, which involves the 
NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK, also known as MAP3K14). The mouse growth plate 
consists of the resting zone, proliferative zone, prehypertrophic zone, and 
hypertrophic zone. The p65 (RelA), which plays a central role in the classical 
pathway, is expressed throughout the cartilage layer, from the resting zone to 
the hypertrophic zone. Inhibiting the classical NF-κB signaling pathway blocks 
growth hormone (GH) or insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling, suppresses 
cell proliferation, and suppresses bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) 
expression, thereby promoting apoptosis. Since the production of autoantibodies 
and inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin 
(IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, are regulated by the classical pathways and are 
increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), NF-κB inhibitors are used to suppress 
inflammation and joint destruction in RA models. In osteoarthritis (OA) models, 
the strength of NF-κB-activation is found to regulate the facilitation or 
suppression of OA. On the other hand, RelB is involved in the alternative 
pathway, and is expressed in the periarticular zone during the embryonic period 
of development. The alternative pathway is involved in the generation of 
chondrocytes in the proliferative zone during physiological conditions, and in 
the development of RA and OA during pathological conditions. Thus, NF-κB is an 
important molecule that controls normal development and the pathological 
destruction of cartilage.

Interleukin-21 (IL-21), an autocrine cytokine predominantly produced by 
follicular helper T (Tfh) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, has been proven to play 
an important role in the immune system, for example, by promoting proliferation 
and the development of Tfh and Th17 cells, balancing helper T cell subsets, 
inducing B cell generation and differentiation into plasma cells, and enhancing 
the production of immunoglobulin. These effects are mainly mediated by 
activation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K pathways. Some IL-21 target genes, 
such as B lymphocyte induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), suppressor of 
cytokine signaling (SOCS), CXCR5 and Bcl-6, play important roles in the immune 
response. Therefore, IL-21 has been linked to autoimmune diseases. Indeed, IL-21 
levels are increased in the peripheral blood and tissues of patients with 
systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes 
(T1D), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), 
autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and psoriasis. This increased IL-21 even 
positively associates with Tfh cells, plasma cells, autoantibodies and disease 
activity in SLE and RA. Additionally, IL-21 has been utilized as a therapeutic 
target in SLE, RA, T1D and psoriatic mouse models. Profoundly, clinical trials 
have shown safety and improvement in RA patients. However, tolerance and 
long-term pharmacodynamics effects with low bioavailability have been found in 
SLE patients. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the latest progress on 
IL-21 function and its signaling pathway and discuss the role of IL-21 in the 
pathogenesis of and therapy for autoimmune diseases, with the hope of providing 
potential therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for clinical use.

BACKGROUND: Many bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid 
arthritis are commonly associated with excessive activity of the osteoclast. 
Ganomycin I (GMI), a meroterpenoid isolated from Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma 
lucidum, possesses a variety of beneficial effects on human health. However, its 
impact and underlying mechanism on osteoclastogenesis remain unclear. In the 
present study, we investigated the effect of GMI on RANKL-induced osteoclast 
formation in mouse BMMs and RAW264.7 cells.
METHODS: BMMs or RAW264.7 cells were treated with GMI followed by an evaluation 
of cell viability, RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, actin-ring 
formation, and resorption pits activity. Effects of GMI on RANKL-induced 
phosphorylation of MAPKs as well as the expression levels of NFATc1 and c-Fos 
were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Expression levels of osteoclast marker 
genes were evaluated by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-qPCR.
RESULTS: GMI significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by 
decreasing the number of osteoclasts, osteoclast actin-ring formation, and bone 
resorption in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cell viability. At 
molecular level, GMI inhibited the RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, 
and p38 MAPKs, as well as the expression levels of c-Fos and NFATc1, which are 
known to be crucial transcription factors for osteoclast formation. In addition, 
GMI decreased expression levels of osteoclastogenesis specific marker genes 
including c-Src, CtsK, TRAP, MMP-9, OSCAR, and DC-STAMP in RANKL-stimulated 
BMMs.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GMI can attenuate osteoclast formation by 
suppressing RANKL-mediated MAPKs and NFATc1 signaling pathways and the 
anti-osteoclastogenic activity of GMI may extend our understanding of molecular 
mechanisms underlying biological activities and pharmacological use of G. 
lucidum as a traditional anti-osteoporotic medicine.

Many bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are 
attributed to an increase in osteoclast number or activity; therefore, control 
of osteoclasts has significant clinical implications. This study shows how 
skullcapflavone II (SFII), a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory activity, 
regulates osteoclast differentiation, survival, and function. SFII inhibited 
osteoclastogenesis with decreased activation of MAPKs, Src, and cAMP response 
element-binding protein (CREB), which have been known to be redox sensitive. 
SFII decreased reactive oxygen species by scavenging them or activating nuclear 
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and its effects were partially 
reversed by hydrogen peroxide cotreatment or Nrf2 deficiency. In addition, SFII 
attenuated survival, migration, and bone resorption, with a decrease in the 
expression of integrin β3, Src, and p130 Crk-associated substrate, and the 
activation of RhoA and Rac1 in differentiated osteoclasts. Furthermore, SFII 
inhibited osteoclast formation and bone loss in an inflammation- or 
ovariectomy-induced osteolytic mouse model. These findings suggest that SFII 
inhibits osteoclastogenesis through redox regulation of MAPKs, Src, and CREB and 
attenuates the survival and resorption function by modulating the integrin 
pathway in osteoclasts. SFII has therapeutic potential in the treatment and 
prevention of bone diseases caused by excessive osteoclast activity.-Lee, J.,

OBJECTIVE: Disease-associated, differentially hypermethylated regions have been 
reported in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but no DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 
have been evaluated in either RA or any animal models of RA. The present study 
was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 5'-azacytidine (5'-azaC), 
a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and explore the cellular and gene regulatory 
networks involved in the context of autoimmune arthritis.
METHODS: A disease-associated genome-wide DNA methylation profile was explored 
by methylated CpG island recovery assay-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in 
arthritic B cells. Mice with proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) were treated 
with 5'-azaC. The effect of 5'-azaC on the pathogenesis of PGIA was explored by 
measuring serum IgM and IgG1 antibody levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, investigating the efficiency of class-switch recombination (CSR) and 
Aicda gene expression using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, 
monitoring germinal center (GC) formation by immunohistochemistry, and 
determining alterations in B cell subpopulations by flow cytometry. The 
5'-azaC-induced regulation of the Aicda gene was explored using RNA 
interference, ChIP, and luciferase assays.
RESULTS: We explored arthritis-associated hypermethylated regions in mouse B 
cells and demonstrated that DNA demethylation had a beneficial effect on 
autoimmune arthritis. The 5'-azaC-mediated demethylation of the epigenetically 
inactivated Ahr gene resulted in suppressed expression of the Aicda gene, 
reduced CSR, and compromised GC formation. Ultimately, this process led to 
diminished IgG1 antibody production and amelioration of autoimmune arthritis in 
mice.
CONCLUSION: DNA hypermethylation plays a leading role in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune arthritis and its targeted inhibition has therapeutic potential in 
arthritis management.

OBJECTIVES: To decipher the phenotype of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from 
circulating progenitors issued from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: RA and control ECs were compared according to their proliferative 
capacities, apoptotic profile, response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
stimulation and angiogenic properties. Microarray experiments were performed to 
identify gene candidates relevant to pathological angiogenesis. Identified 
candidates were detected by RT-PCR and western blot analysis in ECs and by 
immunohistochemistry in the synovium. Their functional relevance was then 
evaluated in vitro after gene invalidation by small interfering RNA and 
adenoviral gene overexpression, and in vivo in the mouse model of methyl-bovine 
serum albumin-(mBSA)-induced arthritis.
RESULTS: RA ECs displayed higher proliferation rate, greater sensitisation to 
TNF-α and enhanced in vitro and in vivo angiogenic capacities. Microarray 
analyses identified the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) as a 
relevant gene candidate. Decreased SIRT1 expression was detected in RA ECs and 
synovial vessels. Deficient endothelial SIRT1 expression promoted a 
proliferative, proapoptotic and activated state of ECs through the acetylation 
of p53 and p65, and lead the development of proangiogenic capacities through the 
upregulation of the matricellular protein cysteine-rich angiogenic protein-61. 
Conditional deletion of SIRT1 in ECs delayed the resolution of experimental 
methyl-bovine serum albumin-(mBSA)-induced arthritis. Conversely, SIRT1 
activation reversed the pathological phenotype of RA ECs and alleviates signs of 
experimental mBSA-induced arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role of SIRT1 in RA and may have 
therapeutic implications, since targeting angiogenesis, and especially SIRT1, 
might be used as a complementary therapeutic approach in RA.

Inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease 
(CAVD) which is a major contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lacks 
non-surgical treatment. The progranulin (PGRN) is an important immunomodulatory 
factor in a variety of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and pneumonia. However, its role in 
calcification of aortic valve remains unknown. We firstly found that PGRN was 
increased in calcified human aortic valve (AV) tissues. Interestingly, in 
addition to full-length PGRN (68KD), a much stronger band of approximately 45 KD 
was also significantly increased. The band of 45 KD (45-GRN), was present in 
wild type (WT) mouse MEFs and AV but absent in grn-/-MEFs, indicating that it 
was a specific degradation product derived from PGRN. 45-GRN was upregulated 
whereas PGRN was reduced in human valve interstitial cells (hVICs) under 
calcifying conditions which is induced by osteogenic medium (OM). In primary 
porcine VICs (pVICs), PGRN downregulated TNF-α and α-SMA which was accompanied 
by downregulation of RUNX2, OPN, OCN, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium 
deposition, effects pointing to reduced inflammation, myofibroblastic and 
osteoblastic transition under calcifying conditions. We overexpressed a mimic of 
45-GRN which contains p-G-F-B-A-C in pVICs. However, 45-GRN overexpression 
promoted OM-induced calcification through activating the Smad1/5/8, NF-κB and 
AKT signaling pathways. Inhibition of the three signaling pathways suppressed 
45-GRN's effect on VICs phenotype transition. 45-GRN promoted TNF-α and 
expressed converse pathogenic signatures with PGRN during TNF-α stimulation. 
Collectively, this study provides new insight into the pathogenesis of CAVD, 
indicating that PGRN is a stratagem in mitigating valve fibrosis/osteoblastic 
differentiation, and also presenting 45-GRN as a potential target for the 
treatment of CAVD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of recombinant human PDCD5 (rhPDCD5) 
treatment in a rat model of bovine II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis (CIA) on 
inflammatory cytokine secretion, proliferation and apoptosis of activated 
lymphocytes and explore the mechanisms of rhPDCD5-induced immunosuppression on 
activated lymphocytes.
METHODS: Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control group, 
CIA+ ovalbumin (OVA) group, CIA+ rhTNFR: Fc group, and CIA+rhPDCD5 group. The 
rats in the latter 3 groups received intraperitoneal injections of OVA (14 
mg/kg), rhTNFR: Fc (3.5 mg/kg) or rhPDCD5 (14 mg/kg) from day 2 to day 26 
following CII injection. On day 28, the spleens of the rats were harvested for 
preparing single cell suspensions of splenocytes, which were activated by CII 
(20μg/mL) or anti-CD3 (1μg/mL)+ anti-CD28 (2μg/mL) for 48 h and 72 h. The 
production of interferon-γ(IFN-γ) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) by the activated 
lymphocytes was determined by ELISA of the culture supernatants. The 
proliferation and apoptosis of the activated lymphocytes were assessed using 
[3H]-thymidine incorporation assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with those in CIA + OVA group, IFN-γand IL-17A secretions by 
the activated lymphocytes from rhPDCD5-treated CIA rats significantly decreased. 
RhPDCD5 treatment of the CIA rats obviously suppressed the proliferation and 
promoted apoptosis of the lymphocytes activated by CII or by anti-CD3 + 
anti-CD28.
CONCLUSION: rhPDCD5 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, inhibits the 
proliferation and promotes activation-induced cell death of activated CD4 + 
lymphocytes to produce immunosuppression in rat models of CIA.

proliferation and apoptosis of the activated lymphocytes were assessed using 
[3H]-thymidine incorporation assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with those in CIA + OVA group, IFN-γand IL-17A secretions by 
the activated lymphocytes from rhPDCD5-treated CIA rats significantly decreased. 
RhPDCD5 treatment of the CIA rats obviously suppressed the proliferation and 
promoted apoptosis of the lymphocytes activated by CII or by anti-CD3 + 
anti-CD28.
CONCLUSIONS: rhPDCD5 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, inhibits the 
proliferation and promotes activation-induced cell death of activated CD4 + 
lymphocytes to produce immunosuppression in rat models of CIA.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Porana sinensis Hemsl. has been widely used to 
treat joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 
Although evidence exists to support a pharmacological action of P. sinensis for 
the treatment of gout arthritis (GA), the underlying mechanism of action remains 
unknown due to it being a multi-component and multi-target agent.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To clarify the active compounds and mechanism of P. sinensis 
against GA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study combined network pharmacology with 
experiments to clarify the mechanism of P. sinensis against GA. A 
protein-protein interaction network for gout was constructed to identify the 
potential drug targets, and molecular docking was subsequently performed to 
determine whether the protein was a target for the compounds of P. sinensis. 
KEGG pathway analysis was then conducted to elucidate the pathway involved in 
the P. sinensis-mediated treatment of gout. A rat model of GA was used to 
further investigate the mechanism of P. sinensis against GA.
RESULTS: The network pharmacology study indicates that coumarins and chlorogenic 
acids of P. sinensis may serve as additives to GA treatment. P. sinensis played 
a role in the treatment of GA by regulating the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, NF-kappa B and 
toll-like receptor pathways and so on. Moreover, experimental validation 
suggests that P. sinensis extract significantly suppressed the expression of 
TLR2 and MyD88 mRNA, regulating the release of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4 and 
TGF-β), lowering lipid peroxidation (MDA) and increasing antioxidant status 
(SOD).
CONCLUSION: The present study clarifies the mechanism of P. sinensis against GA, 
and provides evidence to support its clinical use.

Scaffold proteins such as radixin help to modulate the plasma membrane 
localization and transport activity of the multidrug resistance-associated 
protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) efflux transporters in 
the liver. We examined changes in radixin expression and interaction with efflux 
transporters in adjuvant-induced arthritic (AA) rats, an animal model of 
rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in human liver cancer (HepG2) cells because 
inflammation affects drug pharmacokinetics via the efflux transporters. The 
expression levels of radixin and phosphorylated radixin (p-radixin) were 
measured 24 h after treatment with inflammatory cytokines comprising tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 or sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 
a nitric oxide donor). The protein levels of radixin, MRP2, and P-gp in the rat 
liver were next examined. We also investigated whether inflammation affected the 
formation of complexes between radixin and MRP2 or P-gp. The mRNA and protein 
levels of radixin in HepG2 cells were significantly decreased by TNF-α 
treatment, while minimal changes were observed after treatment with IL-1β, IL-6 
or SNP. TNF-α also significantly decreased the protein levels of p-radixin, 
suggesting that TNF-α inhibited the activation of radixin and thereby reduced 
the activity of the efflux transporters. Complex formation of radixin with MRP2 
and P-gp was significantly decreased in AA rats but this was reversed by 
prednisolone and dexamethasone treatment, indicating that decreased interactions 
of radixin with MRP2 and P-gp likely occur during liver inflammation. These data 
suggest that liver inflammation reduces radixin function by decreasing its 
interactions with MRP2 and P-gp.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic systemic autoimmune disease. 
Recent studies show that gut flora plays an important role in regulating the 
systemic immune response, and gut dysbacteria are linked with systemic chronic 
inflammation in the development of RA. Our previous results found that Qingluo 
Tongbi decoction (QLT) can treat RA effectively. The present study explored the 
effect of QLT on gut flora in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rat model. 
Thirty rats were divided randomly into three groups: a control group, a model 
group, and a treatment group (n = 10 per group). The rats in the model group 
were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant (FCA), while the treatment group 
received FCA combined with QLT treatment. After 27 days, the gut flora was 
profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The levels of cadherin-11, IL-17α, TLR2, 
and TLR4 proteins in the synovial tissues were detected by western blotting 
(WB). The results showed that QLT treatment significantly inhibited raw swelling 
during the 15-27 d period compared with the model group. QLT treatment reversed 
the ten altered bacterial genera in the model group, and three families 
(Lachnospiraceae, Eubacteriaceae, and Leuconostocaceae) were closely related to 
QLT treatment based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Functional prediction 
showed seven types of predicted functions were related to the QLT treatment, and 
WB results showed that QLT treatment reversed the increased expression levels of 
cadherin-11, IL-17α, TLR2, and TLR4 in synovial tissues significantly. The 
expression levels of cadherin-11, IL-17α, and TLR2 correlated negatively with 
the abundance of Staphylococcus and Candidatus_Saccharimonas. Therefore, RA 
development was related to gut dysbiosis, and QLT effectively ameliorated RA 
with decreased inflammatory responses regulated by the gut flora.

The effect of quercetin was assessed in rats induced with complete Freund 
adjuvant (CFA). Arthritis scores, paw oedema, latency, activities of 
myeloperoxidase (MPO), ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 
(E-NTPDase), and ectoadenosine deaminase (E-ADA) in lymphocytes were determined. 
Furthermore, nucleotide and nucleoside levels as well as the secretion of pro- 
and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Animals were treated with saline 
and quercetin in doses of 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg for 45 days. The result revealed 
that quercetin (50 mg/kg) reduced arthritis score and paw oedema, and increased 
the latency in the thermal hyperalgesia test. Histopathological analysis showed 
that all the doses of quercetin reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells. MPO 
activity was increased in the arthritis group; however, quercetin reduced this 
activity. E-NTPDase activity was increased in lymphocytes of arthritis rats, and 
treatment with quercetin reversed this increase. However, E-ADA activity was 
reduced in the arthritis group, and treatment with quercetin modulated the 
activity of this enzyme in arthritis rat groups. Serum adenosine levels were 
increased in arthritis, and the levels were lowered with quercetin treatment. 
Quercetin treatment in arthritis groups decreased the elevated levels of 
cytokines in the arthritis control group. Thus, quercetin demonstrated an 
anti-inflammatory effect, and this flavonoid may be a promising natural compound 
for the treatment of arthritis. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Quercetin may 
represent a potential therapeutic compound in the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis. Findings from this study indicate that quercetin suppresses swelling 
and attenuates the underlying inflammatory responses. This is the first report 
where quercetin was shown to modulate the immune response to arthritis via 
attenuation of the purinergic system (E-NTPDase and E-ADA activities) and the 
levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4. Thus, this work is relevant to basic research and 
may be translated into clinical practice.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases, delta (PI3Kδ) and gamma (PI3Kγ) are enriched in 
immune cells and regulate the development and function of innate and adaptive 
immunity. Dual PI3Kδγ inhibitors are considered high value targets for their 
potential to treat a variety of immune-mediated diseases, but their discovery 
has been challenging. Here we describe the preclinical pharmacology of 
HM5023507, an orally active dual inhibitor of δγ isoforms in immune signaling. 
HM5023507 inhibited PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ isoforms with greater than 100-fold 
selectivity against PI3Kα and PI3Kβ in recombinant enzymatic assays and in 
primary human immune cells with an exquisite selectivity against other targets. 
HM5023507 attenuated the PI3Kδ/γ signaling in human basophils (IC50: 
42/340 nmol/L; selectivity ratio ~1:8). HM5023507 attenuated the activation and 
function of human B and T cells, Th17 differentiation of CD4 T cells in the 
blood of healthy donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients, and cytokine and IgG 
production in human T and B cell cocultures, in vitro. Orally dosed HM5023507 
attenuated PI3K δ/γ-mediated immune signaling in the rat in a dose-related 
manner. In addition, HM5023507 inhibited semiestablished collagen-induced 
arthritic inflammation in the rats (ED50 of 0.25mg/kg, p.o. BID or 0.5 mg/kg, 
QD, AUC: 1422 ng/mL*h), improved histopathology- and micro-computed tomography 
(µCT)-based indices of joint damage, bone destruction, and attenuated the levels 
of anti-collagen antibody, with an overall anti-inflammatory profile matching 
that of a TNFα neutralizing antibody. The PI3K δγ inhibitory profile of 
HM5023507 and its selectivity make it a useful tool to further delineate 
immunobiology of dual PI3K δγ targeting.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the activity of two phosphodiesterase (PDE) 
inhibitors, namely GRMS-55 and racemic lisofylline ((±)-LSF)) in vitro and in 
animal models of immune-mediated disorders.
METHODS: Inhibition of human recombinant (hr)PDEs and TNF-alpha release from 
LPS-stimulated whole rat blood by the studied compounds were assessed in vitro. 
LPS-induced endotoxemia, concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis, and 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) animal models were used for in vivo evaluation. 
The potency of the investigated compounds was evaluated using PK/PD and 
PK/PD/disease progression modeling.
RESULTS: GRMS-55 is a potent hrPDE7A and hrPDE1B inhibitor, while (±)-LSF most 
strongly inhibits hrPDE3A and hrPDE4B. GRMS-55 decreased TNF-alpha levels in 
vivo and CIA progression with IC50 of 1.06 and 0.26 mg/L, while (±)-LSF with 
IC50 of 5.80 and 1.06 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, GRMS-55 significantly 
ameliorated symptoms of ConA-induced hepatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: PDE4B but not PDE4D inhibition appears to be mainly engaged in 
anti-inflammatory activity of the studied compounds. GRMS-55 and (±)-LSF seem to 
be promising candidates for future studies on the treatment of immune-related 
diseases. The developed PK/PD models may be used to assess the anti-inflammatory 
and anti-arthritic potency of new compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis and other inflammatory disorders.

Current research suggests that synovial phagocytic cells remove excessive 
amounts of free oxygen radicals (reactive oxygen species [ROS]), thereby 
preventing damage to synovial tissues. Moreover, ROS may affect the expression 
of growth arrest and DNA damage inducible α (GADD45A), thus further promoting 
the activation of synovial fibroblasts. Male adult rats were assessed for 
progression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) using a macroscopic arthritis 
scoring system of the hind paws and by measuring the changes in the rat's body 
weight, and activity level before and after diagnosis of CIA. Rats were 
intraperitoneally injected twice daily with edaravone at doses of 3, 6, and 
9 mL/kg. Samples were taken at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. Edaravone was 
found to significantly reduce macroscopic arthritis and microscopic pathology 
scores in CIA rats. The concentration of endothelial nitric oxide synthase-6, 
glutathione, and heme oxygenase-1 in the serum of rats decreased, as was the 
production of ROS around the synovium and inflammatory factors. Moreover, ROS-1 
increased the expression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 protein by 
altering the expression level of GADD45A, causing aggravation of tissue damage. 
Edaravone also significantly improved the physiological condition of CIA rats, 
including appetite, weight changes, and loss of fur, as well as limb mobility. 
We believe that edaravone acts to reduce the expression of NF-ĸB p65 by clearing 
ROS, which causes reduced expression of GADD45A, and subsequently reduces the 
level of apoptosis and inflammatory response proteins, thereby reducing the 
symptoms of CIA. We, therefore, propose that edaravone is an effective option 
for clinical treatment of rheumatic arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: Articular cartilage damage related to irreversible physical 
disability affects most patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Strategies targeting the preservation of cartilage function are needed. Laser 
acupuncture (LA) can be an emerging alternative therapy for RA; however, its 
molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effect on cartilage has not been 
elucidated. This study aimed to examine the potential chondroprotective effects 
of LA on extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules and proinflammatory cytokines 
in the articular cartilage of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats and explore 
its related mechanisms.
DESIGN: Monoarthritis was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) 
via intraarticular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the 
tibiotarsal joint. Animals were treated with LA at BL60 and KI3 acupoints three 
days after CFA administration with a 780 nm GaAlAs laser at 15 J/cm2 daily for 
ten days. The main outcome measures including paw circumference, paw withdrawal 
threshold, histopathology and immunoassays of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
collagen type II (CoII), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: LA significantly reduced ankle edema and inflammation-induced 
hyperalgesia in AIA rats (P < 0.05). Moreover, the TNF-α levels were 
significantly decreased while CoII, COMP and proteoglycans proteins were 
significantly enhanced following LA stimulation of the AIA cartilage compared to 
those treated with sham-LA (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: LA attenuates cartilage degradation in AIA rat by suppressing TNF-α 
activation and up-regulating ECM macromolecules, suggesting LA might be of 
potential clinical interest in RA treatment.

The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan has been confirmed 
to have a moderate anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo. However, how 
it affects immune cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is still unknown. We found 
that in human synovial tissues, AT1R is significantly expressed on T cells and B 
cells. Treatment with losartan (15 mg/kg) alone and in combination with a low 
dose of methotrexate (MTX 0.25 mg/kg/3 days) significantly suppressed the 
progression of CIA. Secondary paw swelling, joint destruction and the presence 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) in the serum were alleviated 
after treatment. The therapeutic effects of losartan were based on reduced 
T-cell and B-cell activation, specifically by decreased cell vitality and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In addition, losartan combined with a low 
dose of MTX achieved a similar therapeutic effect, while protecting liver and 
kidney from MTX damage. Mechanistically, losartan inhibits the production of 
pro-inflammatory mediators, reduces the phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and p65, 
p50 nuclear transposition in T cells and B cells. Phosphorylation of JNK is not 
affected by losartan in the CIA rat model. losartan can be used as an effective 
RA treatment, which exhibits anti-arthritic effects potentially through 
down-regulating the phosphorylation of p38, ERK and signaling through NF-κB. 
While achieving similar anti-rheumatic effects, a combination therapy of 
losartan with a low dose of MTX, can protect from liver and renal damage caused 
by giving a high dose of MTX.

BACKGROUND: Studies have identified that the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) 
exhibited tumor-like characteristics and was the key factor in the pathogenesis 
of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). GANT61, an antagonist of the sonic hedgehog 
pathway, has been verified with inhibitory effect on many cancers. Here we 
investigated the effect of GANT61 on FLS and the development of collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA).
METHODS: 40 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups: 
normal, CIA, CIA+10 mg/kg GANT61 and CIA+20 mg/kg GANT61. CIA was induced in rat 
with collagen injecting. The GANT61 was administered by intraperitoneal 
injection every 2 days for 3 weeks. The CIA model was identified with the paw 
swelling, arthritis score and the pathologic changes in joint. The FLS of 
different group were primary cultured. The proliferative capacity of FLS was 
detecteded via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method, and the apoptosis was 
detecteded by flow cytometry. The Bcl-2, Bax, Caspases3 and cleaved Caspases3 in 
synovium and FLS were detecteded by Western Blot.
RESULTS: The 20 mg/kg GANT61 treatment reduced the incidence of CIA and relieved 
the arthritis symptoms in CIA rats. The Bcl-2 was upregulated and the Bax was 
downregulated in the CIA rats synovium. The 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg GANT61 
diminished the Bcl-2 expression, 20 mg/kg GANT61 increased the Bax and activated 
the Caspases3 in the CIA synovium. The proliferation of CIA-FLS was 
significantly higher and the apoptosis of the CIA-FLS was lower than that of the 
control group. The 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg GANT61 treatment can reduce cell 
proliferation and induce apoptosis by diminishing Bcl-2 and increasing the Bax 
in CIA-FLS.
CONCLUSIONS: The GANT61 inhibit the proliferation of FLS and alleviated the 
arthritic symptoms in CIA rats, this implied the GANT61 may be recommended as a 
possible candidate for the therapy of RA.

BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease targeting 
joints. This research aimed to explore the effects of Xinfeng capsules (XFC) on 
cardiac injury in adjuvant arthritis (AA) model rats and assessed the associated 
mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS An adjuvant arthritis (AA) rat model was 
established by intracutaneously injection with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). 
Model rats were divided into 4 groups: an AA model group, an astragalus 
polysaccharides (APS) group, a methotrexate (MTX) group, and an XFC and 
triptolide (TPT) group. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe 
histopathologic changes. TUNEL assay was utilized to evaluate the apoptosis of 
cardiomyocytes. ELISA was utilized to evaluate levels of tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 17 (IL-17), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in 
myocardial tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect microRNA-21 
(miRNA21) levels. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/p38, Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear kappa B (NF-kappaB)/p65 levels were evaluated 
using Western blot. RESULTS XFC significantly improved proinflammatory response 
compared to the AA model group (p<0.05). XFC treatment significantly decreased 
the number of cells staining TUNEL-positive compared with the model group 
(p<0.05). XFC treatment significantly reduced TNF-alpha, IL-17, and IL-6 levels 
in myocardial tissues compared to the model group (p<0.05). Levels of miRNA21 
were significantly lower in the XFC group compared to the AA model group 
(p<0.05). TLR4, MAPK/p38, and NF-kappaB/p65 expression levels were significantly 
lower in the XFC group than in the model group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Xinfeng 
capsule, a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, protects against cardiac 
injury in AA rats by modulating proinflammatory cytokines expression via the 
TLR4/MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Angiogenesis can produce an invasive and destructive front, also named a pannus, 
comprised of inflammatory vascular tissue that covers and erodes articular 
cartilage, subchondral bone and peri‑articular soft tissues in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Paeoniflorin‑6'‑O‑benzene sulfonate (CP‑25) is a novel ester 
derivative of paeoniflorin. We previously demonstrated that CP‑25 exerts 
anti‑inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. CP‑25 also exhibits a marked 
therapeutic effect on adjuvant‑induced arthritis (AA), and is able to inhibit 
synovial and immune cell function, according to our previous study. However, the 
effect of CP‑25 on angiogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, AA was 
initiated in Sprague‑Dawley rats via intradermal immunization in the right hind 
metatarsal footpad with heat‑killed Mycobacterium butyricum in liquid paraffin, 
and rats were divided into four groups: Normal, AA rat model, CP‑25 (50 mg/kg) 
and methotrexate (0.5 mg/kg) groups (n=10 rats/group). Subsequently, joint 
synovium in AA rats was pathologically evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin 
staining, synovial vascular proliferation was evaluated by immunofluorescence, 
the synovial expression levels of C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) were 
detected by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, and synovial C‑X‑C chemokine 
receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was detected by western blotting. The results 
demonstrated that CP‑25 ameliorated clinical signs and pannus formation in the 
ankle joint in rats with AA. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation 
between pannus score and CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression. In addition, the effects 
of CP‑25 on endothelial cell function and CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling were studied 
in vitro using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results 
demonstrated that CXCL12 significantly promoted HUVEC proliferation, migration 
and tube formation, and that CP‑25 could reverse these abnormalities by 
inhibiting plasma membrane localization of G protein‑coupled receptor 
kinase 2 (GRK2) in HUVECs. These findings suggested that CP‑25 may markedly 
inhibit pannus formation in AA. This effect may be associated with a reduction 
in the plasma membrane localization of GRK2 in endothelial cells, an enhancement 
of the inhibitory effect of GRK2 on ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm, a reduction in the 
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and in the function of HUVECs.

The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies is well established in human medicine 
and has been amongst the most important contributions of basic science to 
clinical disease. One such antibody, the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor 
antibody, is used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, particularly 
rheumatoid arthritis. It is extremely difficult and a laborious process to go 
from a concept at the research bench, to government approval. Such approval 
implies not only efficacy but, more importantly, an appropriate safety profile. 
In this review, the history of anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody is discussed in 
depth beginning with the author's experience during a sabbatical visit at the 
University of California at Davis in 1978. At that time, it was discovered that 
B cell activation was at least one critical factor in the development of 
autoimmunity. Approximately six years later, the cDNA encoding for IL-6 was 
cloned as BSF-2 (B cell stimulatory factor 2) to differentiate B cells to 
produce antibody. Soon after, it was suggested that this cytokine plays an 
important role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Based on this 
evidence, the journey began to search for an IL-6 inhibitor. Although there were 
numerous obstacles in finding lead compounds, ultimately, basic science 
developed the methodology for high throughput readouts that would inhibit the 
biologic function of IL-6. It was finally concluded that a mouse monoclonal 
antibody against IL-6 receptor would be optimal. In 1991, this antibody was 
humanized by using CDR-grafting technology in collaboration with the MRC 
(Medical Research Council). The drug was named tocilizumab and launched as an 
innovative anti-rheumatic drug in 2008 in Japan. Subsequently, the drug has been 
used throughout the world and has achieved enormous success in helping patients 
who suffer from inflammatory arthropathies. The lessons learned in the 
development of this antibody have application to the study of biologics and 
their application to other human diseases.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, 
including various forms of arthritis. However, their use is limited, amongst 
others, by adverse effects on bone. The Wnt and bone formation inhibitor 
sclerostin was recently implicated in the pathogenesis of GC-induced 
osteoporosis. However, data are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess 
the regulation of sclerostin by GC using several mouse models with high GC 
levels and two independent cohorts of patients treated with GC. Male 24-week-old 
C57BL/6 and 18-week-old DBA/1 mice exposed to GC and 12-week-old mice with 
endogenous hypercortisolism displayed reduced bone formation as indicated by 
reduced levels of P1NP and increased serum sclerostin levels. The expression of 
sclerostin in femoral bone tissue and GC-treated bone marrow stromal cells, 
however, was not consistently altered. In contrast, GC dose- and 
time-dependently suppressed sclerostin at mRNA and protein levels in human 
mesenchymal stromal cells, and this effect was GC receptor dependent. In line 
with the human cell culture data, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 
101) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR, n = 21) who were exposed to GC had lower 
serum levels of sclerostin than healthy age- and sex-matched controls (-40%, P < 
0.01 and -26.5%, P < 0.001, respectively). In summary, sclerostin appears to be 
differentially regulated by GC in mice and humans as it is suppressed by GCs in 
humans but is not consistently altered in mice. Further studies are required to 
delineate the differences between GC regulation of sclerostin in mice and humans 
and assess whether sclerostin mediates GC-induced osteoporosis in humans.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common human demyelinating disease of the 
central nervous system. The IL-12 family of cytokines has four members, which 
are IL-12 (p40:p35), IL-23 (p40:p19), the p40 monomer (p40), and the p40 
homodimer (p402). Since all four members contain p40 in different forms, it is 
important to use a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to characterize these 
molecules. Here, by using such mAbs, we describe selective loss of p40 in serum 
of MS patients as compared to healthy controls. Similarly, we also observed 
decrease in p40 and increase in IL-12, IL-23, and p402 in serum of mice with 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, as 
compared to control mice. Interestingly, weekly supplementation of mouse and 
human recombinant p40 ameliorated clinical symptoms and disease progression of 
EAE. On the other hand, IL-12, IL-23, and p402 did not exhibit such inhibitory 
effect. In addition to EAE, p40 also suppressed collagen-induced arthritis in 
mice. Using IL-12Rβ1-/-, IL-12Rβ2-/-, and IL-12Rβ1+/-/IL-12Rβ2-/- mice, we 
observed that p40 required IL-12Rβ1, but not IL-12Rβ2, to suppress EAE. 
Interestingly, p40 arrested IL-12-, IL-23-, or p402-mediated internalization of 
IL-12Rβ1, but neither IL-12Rβ2 nor IL-23R, protected regulatory T cells, and 
suppressed Th1 and Th17 biasness. These studies identify p40 as an 
anti-autoimmune cytokine with a biological role different from IL-12, IL-23, and 
p402 in which it attenuates autoimmune signaling via suppression of IL-12Rβ1 
internalization, which may be beneficial in patients with MS and other 
autoimmune disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical in the development of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Metabolic abnormalities cause dysregulation of 
multiple immune cells, but the metabolic regulation of type I IFN production is 
not well clarified in SLE. We undertook this study to define amino acid 
metabolism features in SLE and to explore the function of disease-relevant 
metabolites in the control of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-mediated type I 
IFN production and the progression of SLE.
METHODS: Metabolomic profiling of the serum from SLE patients and healthy 
controls was performed by mass spectrometry. The effects of SLE-related 
metabolites on type I IFN production were explored in human and mouse pDCs. The 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of pDCs from wild-type and Ncf1-/- mice 
were measured by flow cytometry. Mechanisms were investigated by RNA sequencing 
and immunoblotting. In vivo effects of SLE-relevant metabolites were 
systemically analyzed in B6.Cg-Sle1NZM2410/Aeg Yaa/DcrJ mice.
RESULTS: Taurine was higher in the serum from SLE patients compared to healthy 
controls (P < 0.001) and rheumatoid arthritis patients (P < 0.001). Taurine 
content was positively correlated with disease activity and the expression of 
IFN signature genes. The addition of taurine facilitated IFN regulatory factor 7 
phosphorylation and enhanced type I IFN production by reducing the ROS levels in 
pDCs in a neutrophil cytosolic factor 1-dependent manner. Taurine 
supplementation promoted expression of type I IFN-induced genes, activated 
lymphocytes, and increased autoantibodies and proteinuria, leading to more 
serious nephritis.
CONCLUSION: Taurine metabolism is involved in the development of SLE by 
enhancing pDC-mediated type I IFN production. Targeted inhibition of taurine or 
implementation of a taurine-restricted diet has therapeutic potential in SLE.

AIMS: (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is a triptolide analog with excellent 
capability against cancers, cerebral ischemic injury and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Here, we discovered its hepatoprotective effects in a mouse model of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ameliorating liver lipid 
accumulation.
MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat/high-fructose (HFHFr) 
diet for 29 weeks to induce the pathological phenomena of NAFLD. Then the mice 
were treated with LLDT-8 (0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg) or Vehicle for 8 weeks. Finally, 
the serum biochemical indexes, liver histological features, fatty acids (FAs) 
profile and related gene expression in liver were detected to investigate the 
effect of LLDT-8 on lipid accumulation and its possible mechanism.
KEY FINDINGS: LLDT-8 treatment significantly inhibited hepatic injury featured 
by the decrease of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
transaminase (AST), the lessening of hepatic ballooning and macrovesicular 
steatosis. Moreover, LLDT-8 could downregulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA 
desaturase 1 (SCD1), which further led to the lower ratios of C16:1/C16:0 and 
C18:1/C18:0 and thus inhibited lipid synthesis. LLDT-8 treatment also could 
upregulate liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), 
long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl) and medium-chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase (Acadm) expression levels involved in fatty acids oxidation (FAO) 
and markedly promoted lipolysis.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide a novel application of LLDT-8 in improving 
NAFLD.

Post-translational modifications are induced in stressed cells which cause them 
to be recognised by the system. One such modification is citrullination where 
the positive charged arginine is modified to a neutral citrulline. We 
demonstrate most healthy donors show an oligoclonal CD4 response in vitro to at 
least one citrullinated vimentin or enolase peptide. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis 
patients, these T cell responses were not restricted by HLA-DRB1 shared epitope 
(SE) alleles, suggesting they could be presented by other MHC class II alleles. 
As HLA-DP is less polymorphic than HLA-DR, we investigated whether the common 
allele, HLA-DP4 could present citrullinated epitopes. The modification of 
arginine to citrulline enhanced binding of the peptides to HLA-DP4 and induced 
high-frequency CD4 responses in HLA-DP4 transgenic mouse models. Our previous 
studies have shown that tumours present citrullinated peptides restricted 
through HLA-DR4 which are good targets for anti-tumour immunity. In this study, 
we show that citrullinated vimentin and enolase peptides also induced strong 
anti-tumour immunity (100% survival, p < 0.0001) against established B16 tumours 
and against the LLC/2 lung cancer model (p = 0.034) both expressing HLA-DP4. 
Since most tumours do not constitutively express MHC class II molecules, models 
were engineered that expressed MHC class II under the control of an IFNγ 
inducible promoter. Immunisation with citrullinated peptides resulted in 90% 
survival (p < 0.001) against established B16 HHD tumour expressing IFNγ 
inducible DP4. These studies show that citrullinated peptides can be presented 
by a range of MHC class II molecules, including for the first time HLA-DP4, and 
are strong targets for anti-tumour immunity.

(early onset asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), primary biliary 
cholangitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) map to chromosomal region 17q12-q21. The 
predominant view is that association between 17q12-q21 alleles and increased 
risk of developing asthma or IBD is due to regulatory variants. ORM sphingolipid 
biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising 
gene candidate for explaining association with disease. However, the 
relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and disease is complex suggesting 
contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental 
modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of 
thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of 
several common chronic inflammatory diseases. However, their role in the 
regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core 
clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 
200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms 
influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory 
elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in 
cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of 
zona pellucida binding protein 2 (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin B (GSDMB), and 
ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic 
variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that 
Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific 
fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression 
profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the 
deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first 
evidence that disease-associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by 
circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock 
gene Nr1d1.

In the current concept of bacterial infections, pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs) derived from pathogens and damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs) released from damaged/necrotic host cells are crucial factors in 
induction of innate immune responses. However, the implication of DAMPs in 
apical and marginal periodontitis is unknown. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a DAMP 
that is involved in the development of various chronic inflammatory diseases, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we tested whether SAA is 
involved in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions, using human periapical 
surgical specimens and mice deficient in SAA and Toll-like receptors (TLR). 
SAA1/2 was locally expressed in human periapical lesions at the mRNA and protein 
levels. The level of SAA protein appeared to be positively associated with the 
inflammatory status of the lesions. In the development of mouse periapical 
inflammation, SAA1.1/2.1 was elevated locally and systemically in wild-type (WT) 
mice. Although SAA1.1/2.1 double-knockout and SAA3 knockout mice had redundant 
attenuation of the extent of periapical lesions, these animals showed strikingly 
improved inflammatory cell infiltration versus WT. Recombinant human SAA1 
(rhSAA1) directly induced chemotaxis of WT neutrophils in a dose-dependent 
manner in vitro. In addition, rhSAA1 stimulation significantly prolonged the 
survival of WT neutrophils as compared with nonstimulated neutrophils. 
Furthermore, rhSAA1 activated the NF-κB pathway and subsequent IL-1α production 
in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. However, TLR2/TLR4 double deficiency 
substantially diminished these SAA-mediated proinflammatory responses. Taken 
together, the SAA-TLR axis plays an important role in the chronicity of 
periapical inflammation via induction of inflammatory cell infiltration and 
prolonged cell survival. The interactions of PAMPs and DAMPs require further 
investigation in dental/oral inflammation.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is diagnosed by core symptoms including impaired 
social communication and the presence of repetitive and stereotypical behaviors. 
There is also evidence for immune dysfunction in individuals with ASD, but it is 
a disease that is still insufficiently controlled by current treatment 
strategies. The use of 5-aminoisoquinolinone (5-AIQ) ameliorates several 
immune-mediated symptoms including rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, and has 
neuroprotective properties; however, its role in ASD is not yet characterized. 
In this study, we investigated the effect of 5-AIQ on sociability tests, 
self-grooming, marble burying, and locomotor activities in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J 
(BTBR) mice, which serve as an ASD animal model. We further investigated the 
possible molecular mechanism of 5-AIQ administration on CXCR4-, CXCR6-, IFN-γ-, 
IL-22-, NOS2-, STAT1-, T-bet-, and RORγT-producing CD3+ T cells isolated from 
the spleens of treated mice. We also explored its effects on mRNA expression in 
brain tissue. Our results showed that in BTBR mice, 5-AIQ treatment 
significantly prevented self-grooming and marble burying behaviors and enhanced 
social interactions without any adverse effects on locomotor activity/anxiety 
level. Additionally, 5-AIQ treatment substantially decreased CXCR4-, CXCR6-, 
IFN-γ-, IL-22-, NOS2-, STAT1-, T-bet-, and RORγT-producing CD3+ T cells in the 
spleen. Furthermore, 5-AIQ treatment decreased CXCR4, IFN-γ, IL-22, STAT1, and 
RORγT mRNA expression levels in brain tissue. Our findings demonstrated that 
5-AIQ improved behavioral and immune abnormalities associated with ASD, which 
supports the hypothesis that 5-AIQ has important therapeutic potential for the 
treatment of behavioral and neuroimmune dysfunctions in ASD.

BACKGROUND: The seeds of Vitex negundo, with rich lignans metabolites, have been 
widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic herbal medicine for 
the treatment of rheumatism and joint inflammation. The total lignans of Vitex 
negundo seeds (TOV) were suggested to play an important role in the treatment of 
arthritis.
PURPOSE: The aim of the study was designed to investigate the anti-arthritic 
effects of TOV on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats as well as its 
possible mechanisms.
METHODS: TOV was prepared by combined macroporous resin and polyamide column 
chromatography, and constituents of TOV were analyzed by HPLC. CIA model in rats 
was established by immunization with chicken type II collagen and then the rats 
were intragastrically administrated with TOV for 30 days. Rat arthritis was 
evaluated by measurements of hind paw edema, arthritis index score, weight 
growth and indices of thymus and spleen, and by histological examination. Levels 
of serum MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A and TNF-α were 
also examined. In addition, the expression of COX-2, iNOS and IκB, p-IκB in 
synovial tissues was evaluated by western blotting. The analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory effects of TOV were also evaluated in acetic acid-induced 
writhing and xylene-induced ear edema in mice, respectively. In addition, acute 
toxicity test was employed to preliminarily assess the safety of TOV.
RESULTS: TOV significantly inhibited the paw edema and decreased the arthritis 
index, with no influence on the body weight and the indices of thymus and spleen 
of CIA rats. Meanwhile, TOV dose-dependently reduced the infiltration of 
inflammatory cells, synovial hyperplasia and attenuated cartilage damage. 
Additionally, the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, TNF-α, MMP-3 and 
MMP-9 were markedly decreased, while the level of serum IL-10 was increased in 
TOV-treated rats. The significant reduction of the expression of COX-2, iNOS and 
p-IκB and the notable increase of IκB in synovial tissues were also observed in 
TOV-treated animals. TOV also significantly inhibited acetic acid-induced 
writhing and decreased xylene-induced ear edema in mice. Finally, the maximal 
tolerable dose (MTD) of TOV was determined to be 16.0 g/kg.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TOV has significant anti-arthritic 
effects on collagen-induced arthritis in rats, which may be attributed to the 
inhibition of the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, TNF-α, MMP-3 and MMP-9, 
and the increase of IL-10 in serum as well as down-regulation of the protein 
expression of COX-2 and iNOS in synovial tissues via suppressing the 
phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Due to its high efficacy and safety, TOV 
can be regarded as a promising drug candidate for rheumatoid arthritis 
treatment.

Monocytes' plasticity has an important role in the development of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease exhibiting greater prevalence in women. 
Contribution of this phenomenon to sex bias in RA severity was investigated in 
rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA. The greater severity of CIA in 
females (exhibiting signs of bone resorption) was accompanied by the higher 
blood level of advanced oxidation protein products and a more pro-oxidant 
profile. Consistently, in females, the greater density of giant multinuclear 
cells (monocytes/macrophages and osteoclasts) in inflamed joint tissue was 
found. This correlated with the higher frequencies of CCR2- and CX3CR1- 
expressing cells (precursors of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and 
osteoclasts) among CD11b+ splenocytes. This in conjunction with the enhanced 
migratory capacity of CD11b+ monocytic cells in females compared with males 
could be linked with the higher frequencies of CCR2+CX3CR1-CD43lowCD11b+ and 
CCR2-CX3CR1+CD43hiCD11b+ cells (corresponding to "classical" and "non-classical" 
monocytes, respectively) and the greater density of CD68+ cells 
(monocytes/macrophages and osteoclast precursors/osteoclasts) in blood and 
inflamed paws from female rats, respectively. Consistently, the higher levels of 
GM-CSF, TNF-α and IL-6, IL-1β (driving Th17 cell differentiation), and IL-17 
followed by the lower level of IL-10 were measured in inflamed paw cultures from 
female compared with male rats. To the greater IL-17 production (associated with 
enhanced monocyte immigration and differentiation into osteoclasts) most likely 
contributed augmented Th17 cell generation in the lymph nodes draining arthritic 
joints from female compared with male rats. Overall, the study suggests the 
sex-specific contribution of monocytic lineage cells to CIA, and possibly RA 
development.

Objectives: The discovery of alternative and well-tolerated anti-arthritic 
drugs, especially from natural products, is becoming an area of active research. 
Pedunculoside (PE) is a novel triterpene saponin extracted from the dried bark 
of Ilex rotunda Thunb. Limited published papers have reported its 
pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-myocardial 
ischaemia, anti-liver injury, and hypocholesterolaemic activities. However, the 
effect of PE on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. Here, we investigated 
the anti-arthritic effect of PE in both in vitro and in vivo models. Method: The 
inhibitory effects of PE on proliferation, migration, and production of 
inflammatory mediators in primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were 
examined by a 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay, wound-healing 
assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Cellular 
signalling mechanisms were analysed by Western blot. The in vivo studies were 
performed using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Multiple methods, 
including arthritis scoring, enzyme-linked immunoassay, radiography, and 
histopathological assessment, were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of 
PE on CIA rats. Results: The in vitro studies revealed that PE significantly 
inhibited proliferation and migration of FLSs. PE also decreased the production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and 
tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Western blot results suggested that PE 
suppressed TNF-α-stimulated activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase. The in vivo studies showed that PE treatment significantly inhibited 
synovial inflammation and bone destruction in CIA rats. Conclusion: These 
results demonstrate that PE exerts an inhibitory role in FLSs and CIA rats, and 
therefore may have therapeutic value for the treatment of RA.

Baricitinib, is a selective and reversible Janus kinase inhibitor, is commonly 
used to treat adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). A fast, reproducible and sensitive method of liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the quantification of 
baricitinib in rat plasma has been developed. Irbersartan was used as the 
internal standard (IS). Baracitinib and IS were extracted from plasma by 
liquid-liquid extraction using a mixture of n-hexane and dichloromethane (1:1) 
as extracting agent. Chromatographic separation was performed using Acquity UPLC 
HILIC BEH 1.7 µm 2.1 × 50 mm column with the mobile phase consisting of 0.1% 
formic acid in acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH 3) (97:3). The 
electrospray ionization in the positive-mode was used for sample ionization in 
the multiple reaction monitoring mode. Baricitinib and the IS were quantified 
using precursor-to-production transitions of m/z 372.15 > 251.24 and 429.69 > 
207.35 for baricitinib and IS, respectively. The method was validated according 
to the recent FDA and EMA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. The 
lower limit of quantification was 0.2 ng/mL, whereas the intra-day and inter-day 
accuracies of quality control (QCs) samples were ranged between 85.31% to 89.97% 
and 87.50% to 88.33%, respectively. Linearity, recovery, precision, and 
stability parameters were found to be within the acceptable range. The method 
was applied successfully applied in pilot pharmacokinetic studies.

Metabolomics study of a biological system often involves the analysis of many 
comparative samples over a period of several days or weeks. This process of 
long-term sample runs can encounter unexpected instrument drifts such as small 
leaks in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), degradation of column 
performance, and MS signal intensity change. A robust analytical method should 
ideally tolerate these instrumental drifts as much as possible. In this work, we 
report a case study to demonstrate the high tolerance of differential chemical 
isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS method for quantitative metabolome analysis. In a 
study of using a rat model to examine the metabolome changes during rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) disease development and treatment, over 468 samples were analyzed 
over a period of 15 days in three batches. During the sample runs, a small leak 
in LC was discovered after a batch of analyses was completed. Reanalysis of 
these samples was not an option as sample amounts were limited. To overcome the 
problem caused by the small leak, we applied a method of retention time 
correction to the LC-MS data to align peak pairs from different runs with 
different degrees of leak, followed by peak ratio calculation and analysis. 
Herein, we illustrate that using 12 C-/13 C-peak pair intensity values in CIL 
LC-MS as a measurement of concentration changes in different samples could 
tolerate the signal drifts, while using the absolute intensity values (ie, 12 
C-peak as in conventional LC-MS) was not as reliable. We hope that the case 
study illustrated and the method of overcoming the small-leak-caused signal 
drifts can be helpful to others who may encounter this kind of situation in 
long-term sample runs.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease. Dendritic 
cells (DCs) are one of the most powerful antigen-presenting cells, and they play 
an important role in RA pathogenesis. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent lipid 
mediator that can regulate the maturation and activation of DCs, but the 
molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, both in vitro and 
in an RA rat model, we investigated the mechanisms involved by focusing on 
PGE2-mediated signaling and using a novel anti-inflammatory compound, 
paeoniflorin-6'-O-benzene sulfonate (CP-25). PGE2 combined with tumor necrosis 
factor-α promoted DC maturation and activation through EP4-cAMP signaling. 
Treatment with CP-25 increased the endocytic capacity of DCs induced by PGE2. 
CP-25 inhibited the potency of DCs induced by the EP4 receptor agonist, 
CAY10598, to stimulate allogeneic T cells. Consistent with these findings, the 
CAY10598-induced upregulation of DC surface activation markers and production of 
IL-23 was significantly inhibited by CP-25 in a concentration-dependent manner. 
In vivo administration of CP-25 alleviated adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats 
through inhibition of DC maturation and activation. Our results indicate that 
PGE2-EP4-cAMP signal hyperfunction can lead to abnormal activation of DC 
functions, which correlates with the course of disease in AA rats and provides a 
possible treatment target. The inhibition of DC maturation and activation by 
CP-25 interference of the PGE2-EP4 pathway may significantly contribute to the 
immunoregulatory profile of CP-25 when used to treat RA and other immune 
cell-mediated disorders.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Daphne pseudomezereum var. koreana Hamaya is 
distributed in the Gangwon-do of South Korea and is traditionally used to treat 
chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.
AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of 
biflavonoid-rich fraction (BF) obtained from an extract of D. pseudomezereum 
leaves on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and mouse 
model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neochamaejasmin B (NB) and chamaejasmin D (CD) were 
spectroscopically characterized as major components of BF obtained from the 
leaves of D. pseudomezereum. RAW264.7 cells pretreated with NB, CD and BF and 
activated by LPS (500 ng/ml) were used to assess the anti-inflammatory effects 
of these materials in vitro. To evaluate the protective effect of BF on allergic 
asthma, female BALB/c mice were sensitized to OVA by intraperitoneal (i.p.) 
injection and treated with BF by oral administration (15 or 30 mg/kg).
RESULTS: Pretreatment with BF inhibited LPS-stimulated nitric oxide (NO), TNF-α 
and IL-6, and led to upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in RAW264.7 
macrophages. Orally administered BF significantly inhibited the recruitment of 
eosinophils and the production of IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and MCP-1 as judged by the 
analysis of BALF from OVA-induced asthma animal model. BF also decreased the 
levels of IgE in the serum of asthmatic mice. BF suppressed the influx of 
inflammatory cells into nearby airways and the hypersecretion of mucus by the 
airway epithelium of asthmatic mice. In addition, the increase in Penh in 
asthmatic mice was reduced by BF administration. Furthermore, BF led to Nrf2 
activation and HO-1 induction in the lungs of mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These data have shown the anti-asthmatic effects of BF, and 
therefore we expect that BF may be a potential candidate as a natural 
drug/nutraceutical for the prevention and treatment of allergic asthma.

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic joint inflammation leading to bone and 
cartilage damage is the major cause of functional impairment. Whereas reduction 
of synovitis and blockade of joint damage can be successfully achieved by 
disease modifying antirheumatic therapies, bone repair upon therapeutic 
interventions has only been rarely reported. The aim of this study was to use 
fluorodeoxyglucose ([18 F]FDG) and [18 F]fluoride µPET/CT imaging to monitor 
systemic inflammatory and destructive bone remodeling processes as well as 
potential bone repair in an established mouse model of chronic inflammatory, 
erosive polyarthritis. Therefore, human tumor necrosis factor transgenic 
(hTNFtg) mice were treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody, for 4 weeks. 
Before and after treatment period, mice received either [18 F]FDG, for detecting 
inflammatory processes, or [18 F]fluoride, for monitoring bone remodeling 
processes, for PET scans followed by CT scans. Standardized uptake values 
(SUVmean ) were analyzed in various joints and histopathological signs of 
arthritis, joint damage, and repair were assessed. Longitudinal PET/CT scans 
revealed a significant decrease in [18 F]FDG SUVs in affected joints 
demonstrating complete remission of inflammatory processes due to TNF blockade. 
In contrast, [18 F]fluoride SUVs could not discriminate between different 
severities of bone damage in hTNFtg mice. Repeated in vivo CT images proved a 
structural reversal of preexisting bone erosions after anti-TNF therapy. 
Accordingly, histological analysis showed complete resolution of synovial 
inflammation and healing of bone at sites of former bone erosion. We conclude 
that in vivo multimodal [18 F]FDG µPET/CT imaging allows to quantify and monitor 
inflammation-mediated bone damage and reveals not only reversal of synovitis but 
also bone repair upon TNF blockade in experimental arthritis. © 2019 The

AIMS: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is upregulated at sites of tissue 
remodelling including chronic arthritis, solid tumours, and fibrotic hearts. It 
has also been associated with human coronary atherosclerotic plaques. Yet, the 
causal role of FAP in atherosclerosis remains unknown. To investigate the 
cause-effect relationship of endogenous FAP in atherogenesis, we assessed the 
effects of constitutive Fap deletion on plaque formation in 
atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (Apoe) or low-density lipoprotein 
receptor (Ldlr) knockout mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using en face analyses of thoraco-abdominal aortae and 
aortic sinus cross-sections, we demonstrate that Fap deficiency decreased plaque 
formation in two atherosclerotic mouse models (-46% in Apoe and -34% in Ldlr 
knockout mice). As a surrogate of plaque vulnerability fibrous cap thickness was 
used; it was increased in Fap-deficient mice, whereas Sirius red staining 
demonstrated that total collagen content remained unchanged. Using polarized 
light, atherosclerotic lesions from Fap-deficient mice displayed increased FAP 
targets in terms of enhanced collagen birefringence in plaques and increased 
pre-COL3A1 expression in aortic lysates. Analyses of the Stockholm 
Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) data revealed that FAP expression was 
increased in human atherosclerotic compared to non-atherosclerotic arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide causal evidence that constitutive Fap deletion 
decreases progression of experimental atherosclerosis and increases features of 
plaque stability with decreased collagen breakdown. Thus, inhibition of FAP 
expression or activity may not only represent a promising therapeutic target in 
atherosclerosis but appears safe at the experimental level for FAP-targeted 
cancer therapies.
TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is upregulated at 
sites of chronic tissue remodelling including rheumatoid arthritis and solid 
tumours. Indeed, depletion of FAP-positive cells inhibits tumour growth by 
increasing antitumour immunity. FAP has also been correlated with human coronary 
plaques, whereby its causal role remains unknown. Our data provide causal 
evidence that constitutive Fap deletion decreases progression of experimental 
atherosclerosis and increases features of plaque stability. Thus, inhibition of 
FAP expression or activity may not only represent a novel therapeutic target for 
atherosclerosis but appears safe - at the experimental level - for FAP-targeted 
cancer therapies.

B cells fulfill multifaceted functions that influence immune responses during 
health and disease. In autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, 
multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, depletion of functional B cells 
results in an aggravation of disease in humans and respective mouse models. This 
could be due to a lack of a pivotal B cell subpopulation: regulatory B cells 
(Bregs). Although Bregs represent only a small proportion of all immune cells, 
they exhibit critical properties in regulating immune responses, thus 
contributing to the maintenance of immune homeostasis in healthy individuals. In 
this study, we report that the induction of Bregs is differentially triggered by 
the immunogenicity of the host microbiota. In comparative experiments with low 
immunogenic Bacteroides vulgatus and strong immunogenic Escherichia coli, we 
found that the induction and longevity of Bregs depend on strong Toll-like 
receptor activation mediated by antigens of strong immunogenic commensals. The 
potent B cell stimulation via E. coli led to a pronounced expression of 
suppressive molecules on the B cell surface and an increased production of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-10. These bacteria-primed Bregs 
were capable of efficiently inhibiting the maturation and function of dendritic 
cells (DCs), preventing the proliferation and polarization of T helper (Th)1 and 
Th17 cells while simultaneously promoting Th2 cell differentiation in vitro. In 
addition, Bregs facilitated the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
resulting in a possible feedback cooperation to establish immune homeostasis. 
Moreover, the colonization of germfree wild type mice with E. coli but not B. 
vulgatus significantly reduced intestinal inflammatory processes in dextran 
sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis associated with an increase induction of 
immune suppressive Bregs. The quantity of Bregs directly correlated with the 
severity of inflammation. These findings may provide new insights and 
therapeutic approaches for B cell-controlled treatments of microbiota-driven 
autoimmune disease.

Humulus japonicus (HJ) is a widely used herbal medicine in Asia with 
anti‑oxidative, anti‑microbial, and anti‑inflammatory effects. We investigated 
the potential therapeutic effects of HJ in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a 
mouse model of collagen‑induced arthritis (CIA) and a 
lipopolysaccharide‑stimulated murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). The CIA 
mice were administered 300 mg/kg HJ orally starting 3 days prior to second 
immunization. The clinical and histopathological findings were assessed in the 
paw of CIA mice. The levels of autoantibodies and inflammatory markers were 
determined in the plasma and cell culture supernatant, respectively. The 
expression at mRNA and protein levels was analyzed by reverse transcription 
quantitative‑PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. HJ significantly 
decreased the gross arthritic scores and paw swelling in CIA mice. Furthermore, 
synovial inflammation, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion were markedly 
reduced by HJ. It also decreased the expression of inflammatory enzymes in both 
the paw of mice and RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, the expression of genes related 
to all macrophages and pro‑inflammatory M1 macrophage were significantly 
decreased, whereas the expression of anti‑inflammatory M2 macrophage marker was 
markedly increased in the paw of HJ‑treated CIA mice. In addition, HJ suppressed 
the levels of plasma anti‑type II collagen antibody following the decreased 
expression of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell‑associated surface markers and 
cytokines in the paw. HJ also significantly inhibited the expression of IL‑6 
both in vitro and in vivo, followed by reduced STAT3 phosphorylation and 
expression in the paw of CIA mice. Finally, the expression of osteoclast‑related 
genes was decreased in the paw of HJ‑treated CIA mice. These findings suggest 
that HJ can play a role in suppressing the development of CIA by overall 
regulation of articular inflammation. This study should provide new insights 
into the use of HJ as a therapeutically effective natural product against RA.

Several studies have suggested that chemokine receptors are important mediators 
of inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). B cells are also known to 
play an important role in RA pathology. C-X-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CXCR3) 
is considered a potential therapeutic target in different inflammatory diseases; 
however, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the potentially 
protective effect of AMG487, a selective CXCR3 antagonist, in collagen-induced 
arthritis (CIA) mouse model. CIA mice were treated with AMG487 (5 mg/kg) every 
48 h, from day 21 until day 41. We then investigated the effect of AMG487 on 
NF-κB p65-, NOS2-, MCP-1-, TNF-α-, IFN-γ, IL-4-, and IL-27-producing CD19+ B 
cells in the spleen through flow cytometry. We also evaluated the mRNA and 
protein expression levels of these molecules using RT-PCR and western blotting 
in the knee tissues. Our results revealed that AMG487-treated mice showed 
decreased NF-κB p65-, NOS2-, MCP-1-, and TNF-α-, and increased IL-4-, and 
IL-27-producing CD19+ B cells compared with the control mice. Additionally, 
AMG487 treatment significantly down regulated NF-κB p65, NOS2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, 
and upregulated IL-4 and IL-27 mRNA and protein expression levels compared with 
the control. Thus, our study shows that AMG487 exerts its anti-arthritic effect 
by potently downregulating inflammatory B cell signaling. Based on our 
observations, we propose that AMG487 could serve as a potential novel 
therapeutic agent for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including RA.

Studies in the field of angiogenesis have been aggressively growing in the last 
few decades with the recognition that angiogenesis is a hallmark of more than 50 
different pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, oculopathy, 
cardiovascular diseases, and tumor metastasis. During angiogenesis drug 
development, it is crucial to use in vitro assay systems with appropriate cell 
types and proper conditions to reflect the physiologic angiogenesis process. To 
overcome limitations of current in vitro angiogenesis assay systems using mainly 
endothelial cells, we developed a 3-dimensional (3D) co-culture spheroid 
sprouting assay system. Co-culture spheroids were produced by two human vascular 
cell precursors, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) with a ratio of 5 to 1. ECFCs+MSCs spheroids were embedded into 
type I collagen matrix to mimic the in vivo extracellular environment. A 
real-time cell recorder was utilized to continuously observe the progression of 
angiogenic sprouting from spheroids for 24 h. Live cell fluorescent labeling 
technique was also applied to tract the localization of each cell type during 
sprout formation. Angiogenic potential was quantified by counting the number of 
sprouts and measuring the cumulative length of sprouts generated from the 
individual spheroids. Five randomly-selected spheroids were analyzed per 
experimental group. Comparison experiments demonstrated that ECFCs+MSCs 
spheroids showed greater sprout number and cumulative sprout length compared 
with ECFCs-only spheroids. Bevacizumab, an FDA-approved angiogenesis inhibitor, 
was tested with the newly-developed co-culture spheroid assay system to verify 
its potential to screen anti-angiogenic drugs. The IC50 value for ECFCs+MSCs 
spheroids compared to the ECFCs-only spheroids was closer to the effective 
plasma concentration of bevacizumab obtained from the xenograft tumor mouse 
model. The present study suggests that the 3D ECFCs+MSCs spheroid angiogenesis 
assay system is relevant to physiologic angiogenesis, and can predict an 
effective plasma concentration in advance of animal experiments.

Increasing evidence indicates that in response to environmental changes, 
macrophages can dynamically change into two main functional phenotypes, namely 
M1 and M2. Depending on these different phenotypes, macrophages can produce 
either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors which may affect the 
outcome of inflammation. Mastering the switching of M1/M2 phenotypes may provide 
therapeutic approaches to chronic inflammatory disease, such as atherosclerosis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, even the metabolic disorders. Cathepsin C (CTSC), as a 
member of the papain family of cysteine proteases, is a key enzyme in the 
activation of granule serine proteases thereby involved in modulating the 
inflammatory responses. Moreover, abundant expression of CTSC has been found in 
M1 macrophages in plaques of atherosclerosis and related to the progression of 
disease. However, whether CTSC can regulate macrophage activation status in 
inflammatory responses has not been fully investigated. In the present study, 
using peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 
treated with LPS and active monomer of CTSC, we found that CTSC was not only 
expressed in macrophages in M1 activation status, but also facilitated 
macrophages towards M1 phenotype, suggesting a self-activation mechanism 
involved in this process which may lead to a vicious circle in chronic 
inflammation. Then we attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms 
of CTSC resulting in M1 activation. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the 
non-receptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, serving as an upstream 
mediator that leads to transcription of many pro-inflammatory factors. We found 
FAK expression was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels following CTSC 
stimulation, and FAK phosphorylation level was also significantly increased. The 
p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, as the downstream of FAK, were also found activated in 
CTSC-treated macrophages, suggesting that CTSC may promote macrophage towards M1 
activation status through FAK-induced p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway 
activation. Our study provides a new therapeutic target in the treatment of 
chronic inflammatory diseases.

T cell modulation in the clinical background of autoimmune diseases or 
allogeneic cell and organ transplantations with concurrent preservation of their 
natural immunological functions (e.g., pathogen defense) is the major obstacle 
in immunology. An anti-human CD4 antibody (MAX.16H5) was applied intravenously 
in clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid 
arthritis) and acute late-onset rejection after transplantation of a renal 
allograft. The response rates were remarkable and no critical allergic problems 
or side effects were obtained. During the treatment of autoimmune diseases with 
the murine MAX.16H5 IgG1 antibody its effector mechanisms with effects on 
lymphocytes, cytokines, laboratory and clinical parameters, adverse effects as 
well as pharmacodynamics and kinetics were studied in detail. However, as the 
possibility of developing immune reactions against the murine IgG1 Fc-part 
remains, the murine antibody was chimerized, inheriting CD4-directed variable 
domains of the MAX.16H5 IgG1 connected to a human IgG4 backbone. Both antibodies 
were studied in vitro and in specific humanized mouse transplantation models in 
vivo with a new scope. By ex vivo incubation of an allogeneic immune cell 
transplant with MAX.16H5 a new therapy strategy has emerged for the first time 
enabling both the preservation of the graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect and the 
permanent suppression of the acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGVHD) without 
conventional immunosuppression. In this review, we especially focus on 
experimental data and clinical trials obtained from the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases with the murine MAX.16H5 IgG1 antibody. Insights gained from these 
trials have paved the way to better understand the effects with the chimerized 
MAX.16H5 IgG4 as novel therapeutic approach in the context of GVHD prevention.

OBJECTIVES: The interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated signaling pathway plays an 
essential role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. LMT-28 suppresses the 
activation of the IL-6-mediated signaling by direct targeting of gp130. Although 
LMT-28 and metformin both possess anti-inflammatory activity, the beneficial 
effect of LMT-28 and metformin combination on a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) 
model has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the 
anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of a combination of LMT-28 and metformin 
in a CIA model.
METHODS: In MH7A cells, cell proliferation and the IL-6-mediated signaling 
pathway following administration of LMT-28 and metformin combination was 
analyzed through MTT assay and Western blotting. The level of T helper 17 (Th17) 
cell differentiation from CD4+ T cells was analyzed in mouse splenocytes and 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Arthritis score, incidence rate, 
inflammatory cytokine, and T-cell subsets were measured in CIA mice following 
administration of LMT-28 and metformin combination.
RESULTS: Combination treatment with LMT-28 and metformin diminished 
proliferation of MH7A cells and IL-6-mediated gp130, STAT3, and ERK signaling 
more than in individual treatments. Furthermore, the differentiation of CD4+ T 
cells into Th17 cells was attenuated more by combination treatment with LMT-28 
and metformin than individual treatments. The combination of LMT-28 and 
metformin ameliorated the arthritic score better than individual treatments. The 
combination significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor and IL-6 levels in the 
sera and had an anti-inflammatory effect on the distribution of Treg/Th17 cells 
in the lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with LMT-28 and metformin significantly 
ameliorates arthritic symptoms in CIA by suppressing Th17 differentiation and 
IL-6 signaling.

Sinomenine (SN) has been used in the clinical treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis for many years. Studies showed that SN 
held protective effects such as anti-inflammation, scavenging free radicals and 
suppressing immune response in many autoimmune diseases. The purpose of the 
present study is to explore the mechanism of anti-inflammation of SN on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages activation and investigate whether 
the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway participated in. Macrophages isolated from 
mouse peritoneal cavity were stimulated by 1 µg/mL LPS for 24 h. And then the 
cells were treated with various concentrations of SN, TLR4 inhibitor 
respectively for additional 48 h. Drug toxicity was detected by MTT assay and 
Transwell experiment was used to assess chemotaxis. Furthermore, TLR4 and MyD88 
mRNA levels were detected by real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to examine 
TLR4, MyD88 and phosphorylated IκB protein expression in macrophages. 
Immunofluorescence assay was applied to observe p65 NF-κB protein expression in 
macrophage nucleus. We extracted macrophages with high purity and activity from 
the abdominal cavity of mice. SN remarkably inhibited the chemotaxis and 
secretion function of LPS-stimulated macrophages. It also down-regulated both 
the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and the RNA 
and protein levels of the key factors (TLR4, MyD88, P-IκB) in TLR4 pathway. The 
expression of p65 NF-κB protein in nuclei was down-regulated, which was 
correlated with a similar decrease in P-IκB protein level. In conclusion, SN can 
inhibit the LPS induced immune responses in macrophages by blocking the 
activated TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. These results may provide a therapeutic 
approach to regulate inflammatory responses.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, which 
occurs in ~1.0% of the general population. Increasing studies have suggested 
that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may serve important roles in various 
biological processes and may be associated with the pathogenesis of different 
types of disease, including RA. Astragalosides (AST) has been used as a 
traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of RA. However, the mechanism 
underlying its therapeutic effect has remained unclear to date. Thus, there is 
an urgent need to elucidate the possible mechanism of AST in the treatment of RA 
from the perspective of lncRNAs. In the present study, the lncRNAs and mRNAs of 
a vehicle group, animal model group and AST treatment (control) group were 
determined by Arraystar Rat lncRNA/mRNA microarray. The differentially expressed 
genes with a fold change >1.5 and P<0.05 were selected and analyzed. Gene 
Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis was performed using the Database for 
Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery, and the coding‑non‑coding 
gene co‑expression network was drawn based on the correlation analysis between 
the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Based on node degree and the 
correlation between bioinformatics analysis and RA, the critical differentially 
expressed lncRNAs were selected, analyzed and verified by reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) analysis. The results showed that, 
following AST treatment, up to 75 lncRNAs and 247 mRNAs were found to be 
differentially expressed among the three groups. GO and pathway analysis 
manifested that 135 GO terms and 17 pathways were enriched by differentially 
expressed genes. Four lncRNAs (MRAK012530, MRAK132628, MRAK003448 and XR_006457) 
were selected as the critical lncRNAs and their trend in expression showed 
consistency between the RT‑qPCR and microarray data. In conclusion, AST had a 
regulatory effect on differentially expressed lncRNAs during the development of 
RA, and four lncRNAs could be selected as critical therapeutic targets of AST.

Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent cation channels that 
detect decreases in extracellular pH. Dysregulation of ASICs underpins a number 
of pathologies. Of particular interest is ASIC3, which is recognised as a key 
sensor of acid-induced pain and is important in the establishment of pain 
arising from inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the 
identification of new ASIC3 modulators and the mechanistic understanding of how 
these compounds modulate ASIC3 could be important for the development of new 
strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of dysregulated ASIC3 activity 
in inflammation. Here, we report the identification of novel ASIC3 modulators 
based on the ASIC3 agonist, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). Through a 
GMQ-guided in silico screening of Food and Drug administration (FDA)-approved 
drugs, 5 compounds were selected and tested for their modulation of rat ASIC3 
(rASIC3) using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Of the chosen drugs, 
guanabenz (GBZ), an α2-adrenoceptor agonist, produced similar effects to GMQ on 
rASIC3, activating the channel at physiological pH (pH 7.4) and potentiating its 
response to mild acidic (pH 7) stimuli. Sephin1, a GBZ derivative that lacks 
α2-adrenoceptor activity, has been proposed to act as a selective inhibitor of a 
regulatory subunit of the stress-induced protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1R15A) with 
promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
However, we found that like GBZ, sephin1 activates rASIC3 at pH 7.4 and 
potentiates its response to acidic stimulation (pH 7), i.e. sephin1 is a novel 
modulator of rASIC3. Furthermore, docking experiments showed that, like GMQ, GBZ 
and sephin1 likely interact with the nonproton ligand sensor domain of rASIC3. 
Overall, these data demonstrate the utility of computational analysis for 
identifying novel ASIC3 modulators, which can be validated with 
electrophysiological analysis and may lead to the development of better 
compounds for targeting ASIC3 in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

BACKGROUND: Approaches promoting fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) apoptosis 
are considered as a meaningful strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. 
We have previously reported the anti-arthritic effect of penta-acetyl geniposide 
((Ac)5GP, an active derivative of geniposide) on adjuvant-induced arthritis 
(AIA) rats in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the pro-apoptotic 
effect of (Ac)5GP on AIA FLS in vitro and the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Rat AIA was induced by complete Freund's adjuvant, and FLS were 
primary-cultured from synovial tissues. AIA FLS were treated with (Ac)5GP (50, 
100 and 200 μM) for 48 h and cell proliferation and apoptosis were respectively 
examined. The involvement of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase 
3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was checked.
RESULTS: (Ac)5GP inhibited the viability of AIA FLS and reduced the percentage 
of Ki67-positive cells in AIA FLS. Particularly, (Ac)5GP promoted AIA FLS 
apoptosis in vitro by inducing apoptotic nuclear morphology, facilitating DNA 
ladder formation and increasing percentages of both early and late apoptotic 
cells. (Ac)5GP treatment on AIA FLS decreased Bcl-2 protein level whereas 
increased the levels of Bax and caspase 3 proteins. Moreover, (Ac)5GP reduced 
the degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα, down-regulated NF-κB p65 protein 
level in nucleus and inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation.
CONCLUSIONS: (Ac)5GP had a potent pro-apoptotic effect on AIA FLS in vitro, 
which is associated with regulating apoptosis-related proteins and inhibiting 
NF-κB activation.

BACKGROUND: Though the use of salivary miRNAs as potential biomarkers has been 
reported in few diseases/conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and oral 
cancer, there are no reported studies on their utility in periodontal 
diagnostics. Thus, the aim of the present study was to profile salivary miRNAs 
and identify the most suitable salivary miRNA biomarker in chronic 
periodontitis.
METHODS: In this study, we have explored the potential application of next 
generation sequencing (NGS) technology for profiling miRNAs in two unstimulated 
saliva samples collected by passive drool method from a patient diagnosed with 
generalized chronic periodontitis and a healthy control. Subsequently, the 
validation of most highly expressed known miRNA in periodontitis was performed 
in saliva samples collected from an independent set of 16 chronic periodontitis 
patients and 16 periodontally healthy controls using quantitative real-time PCR 
(qRT-PCR). Target gene prediction and pathway mapping were performed using 
bioinformatic tools.
RESULTS: NGS analysis identified 40 upregulated and 40 downregulated known 
miRNAs in chronic periodontitis compared to healthy controls, of which 
miR-143-3p was the most highly expressed miRNA in periodontitis (Read count - 
227630; fold change - 5.82). Validation using qRT-PCR showed significant 
upregulation of miR-143-3p expression in the test group compared with controls 
(P < 0.05). K-RAS (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene) gene was 
predicted as the target gene for miR-143-3p in humans. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of genes and genomes) pathway mapping revealed the involvement of K-RAS in 
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of NGS for miRNA expression profiling can be 
considered a valuable tool in detection of novel biomarkers in periodontal 
diagnostics. Also, the results of the study points to the potential utility of 
miR143-3p as a novel salivary biomarker for chronic periodontitis.

Previously, we reported that oral administration of madecassoside, the main 
active triterpene in Centella asiatica L., exerted anti-arthritis effect by 
inducing the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells in small intestine. This 
study investigates the action site and mechanism of madecassoside to induce Treg 
cells. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) of rats, oral administration of 
madecassoside significantly alleviated arthritis symptoms, but its main 
metabolite madecassic acid did not, suggesting that madecassoside functions in 
the parent form. Madecassoside was shown to increase the number of Treg cells 
and promote the expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 in rat ileum rather than duodenum 
and jejunum, as detected using the immunohistochemistry assay and quantitative 
PCR assay, respectively. Unexpectedly, madecassoside was absent of significant 
effect on in vitro Treg cell differentiation and the expression of Foxp3 and 
IL-10. A combined use of broad-spectrum antibiotics resulted in significant 
reduction of the anti-arthritis effect of madecassoside in CIA rats. The 16S 
rRNA gene sequence showed that madecassoside could reverse the changes of gut 
microbiota under arthritis condition, and enrich several bacteria such as 
Lachnospiraceae, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium, Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum 
and so on. GC-MS assay showed that madecassoside elevated the levels of acetic 
acid and butyric acid, but not other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the 
cecum contents of CIA rats. Butyric acid rather than acetic acid could induce 
the in vitro differentiation of Treg cells and the expression of Foxp3 and 
IL-10. Accordingly, when madecassoside was co-administered with heptanoyl CoA, 
the competitive inhibitor of butyrate synthase, its effect on butyric acid 
production, Treg cell proportion and arthritis nearly disappeared. These 
findings indicate that oral madecassoside induces the generation of Treg cells 
and therefore displays anti-arthritis effect in the parent form but not 
metabolites, and the ileum is the main action site. The mechanism of 
madecassoside can be summarized as: expansion of the richness of 
butyrate-producing bacteria-up-regulation of intestinal butyrate level-induction 
of Treg cell differentiation and IL-10 expression.

The present study aimed to investigate the anti‑arthritic effects of 
curculigoside isolated from the rhizome of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn in vivo 
and in vitro, as well as to determine the potential underlying mechanisms. A rat 
model of arthritis was induced with type II collagen. Arthritic rats were 
treated with curculigoside (50 mg/kg) and blood samples were collected to 
determine serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, 
IL‑6, IL‑10, IL‑12 and IL‑17A. Furthermore, indices of the thymus and spleen 
were determined. The anti‑proliferative effects of curculigoside were detected 
with Cell Counting kit‑8 assays in rheumatoid arthritis‑derived fibroblast‑like 
synoviocyte MH7A cells. In addition, expression levels of Janus kinase (JAK)1, 
JAK3, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, nuclear factor 
(NF)‑κB p65 and its inhibitor (IκB) were determined by western blotting. The 
results revealed that curculigoside inhibited paw swelling and arthritis scores 
in type II collagen‑induced arthritic (CIA) rats. Additionally, curculigoside 
decreased serum levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β, IL‑6, IL‑10, IL‑12 and IL‑17A in CIA 
rats. Curculigoside also significantly inhibited MH7A cell proliferation in a 
time and concentration‑dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment downregulated 
the expression of JAK1, JAK3 and STAT3, and upregulated cytosolic nuclear factor 
(NF)‑κB p65 and IκB. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated 
that curculigoside exhibited significant anti‑arthritic effects in vivo and 
in vitro, and the molecular mechanism may be associated with the JAK/STAT/NF‑κB 
signaling pathway.

Pangolin scale (PS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating 
rheumatic arthritis (RA), and diverse medicinal formulations and therapeutic 
properties of PS have proved great potential to supplement conventional 
treatments in integrative medicine-based strategies. However, few studies have 
investigated how different PS formulations can impact the management of RA. 
Herein, we developed an innovative formulation of PS processed with vinegar 
(PSP) and evaluated it by comparing with the traditional decoction of PS (PSD) 
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NASID) (i.e., meloxicam) in a RA 
Sprague Dawley rat model, which is induced with a complete Freund's adjuvant 
(CFA). The anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated by paw edema measurement, 
arthritic score, histopathological examination, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(IL-1β and TNF-α) production and the whole blood viscosity. PSP treatments 
(249.0 mg/kg.bw) from day 14-42 alleviated paw edema (P < 0.001), arthritic 
index (score 0-1.5) and the inflammatory cell infiltration in the ankle joint, 
which may be attributed to inhibiting the production of TNF-α (P < 0.01) and 
IL-1β (P < 0.05) in the serum. Although PSP is with fewer efficacies than 
meloxicam, it outperformed traditional formulation PSD (830 mg/kg.bw) in all 
above mentioned metrics. Furthermore, PSP exhibited a unique effect on reducing 
whole blood viscosity (P < 0.05) unobserved in meloxicam intervention. The 
present study demonstrates that PSP showed more efficient anti-inflammatory 
activity than PSD in CFA-induced RA rats, possibly due to the presence of higher 
levels of active ingredients. Thus, PSP may be a promising therapy for 
anti-inflammation in RA and can be integrated with conventional treatments, 
particularly for long-term RA management in an integrative treatment strategy.

We identified novel potent inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 
kinase using a structure-based design strategy, beginning with lead compound, 
3-(butan-2-yl)-6-(2,4-difluoroanilino)-1,3-dihydro-2H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-one 
(1). To enhance the inhibitory activity of 1 against production of tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in human whole blood (hWB) cell assays, we designed 
and synthesized hybrid compounds in which the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-one core 
was successfully linked with the p-methylbenzamide fragment. Among the compounds 
evaluated, 
3-(3-tert-butyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-6-yl)-4-methyl-N-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzamide 
(25) exhibited potent p38 inhibition, superior suppression of TNF-α production 
in hWB cells, and also significant in vivo efficacy in a rat model of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). In this paper, we report the discovery of 
potent, selective, and orally bioavailable imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-one-based p38 
MAP kinase inhibitors.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Urginea indica has been used in the traditional 
system of medicine to treat various inflammatory diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Present study investigates the effects of aqueous and 
ethanolic extracts of U. indica on joint inflammation using different models of 
acute and chronic inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: FCA-induced arthritic rat model, a model of chronic joint 
inflammation, was used to evaluate the anti-arthritic effects of plant extracts 
(500 mg/kg, each extract). Macroscopic arthritic scoring, digital water 
plethysmometery, and histopathological evaluation (H & E staining) were 
performed to measure the severity of arthritis. Acute inflammatory models like, 
carrageenan-, histamine- and serotonin-induced paw edema models were used to 
evaluate effects of U. indica, and supported by xylene-induced ear edema model.
RESULTS: Both extracts significantly inhibited arthritic development, paw edema, 
bone erosion, pannus formation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. 
Treatment with U. indica extracts resulted in almost normalization of altered 
counts of white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, and red blood cells (RBCs), along 
with Hb content. Both extracts were found safe in terms of hepatotoxicity and 
nephrotoxicity as determined by non-significant difference of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), urea, and creatinine 
levels among all groups. U. indica significantly attenuated carrageenan-induced 
paw edema. There are several mechanisms involved in the attenuation of 
carrageenan-induced paw edema; inhibition of autacoids is one of those important 
mechanisms. The autacoid inhibition was confirmed by reduction of histamine- and 
serotonin-induced paw edema found in plant extract treated groups. Suppression 
of xylene-induced ear edema by plant extract further validated the suggested 
mechanism of autacoid inhibition. GC-MS analysis showed the presence of 
isopropyl palmitate in the highest quantity (26.852%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the folkloric uses of U. indica and showed 
that plant possessed anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory properties which might 
be ascribed to inhibition of autacoids.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The roots of Ribes orientale (Family 
Grossulariaceae) have long been used as a folk remedy to treat rheumatism and 
joints pain in Northern Areas of Pakistan.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of study was to observe the preventive efficacy of 
roots of Ribes orientale (RO) aqueous ethanolic extract (30:70) and its aqueous 
and n-butanol fractions in treating rheumatoid arthritis and to determine its 
possible mechanism of action.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Arthritis was evaluated in vitro using heat induced bovine 
serum albumin and egg albumin denaturation and membrane stabilizing assays at 
50-6400 μg/ml concentration of extract/fractions whereas, in vivo arthritis was 
evaluated at 50, 100, 200 mg/kg doses of extract/fractions in formaldehyde model 
by measuring rat paw volume/diameter. Moreover, highest effective dose 
(200 mg/kg) of extract/fractions was evaluated in Freünd complete adjuvant (FCA) 
model. Arthritis was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by immunization with 0.1 ml 
FCA in left footpad. RO extract/fractions at 200 mg/kg were orally administered 
from day 0, 30 min prior to adjuvant injection and sustained for 28 days. Paw 
volume/diameter, arthritic score, body weight, and hematological (WBC, RBC, ESR, 
Hb and Platelet count) and biochemical (AST, ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, CRP and 
RF) parameters were observed. The mRNA expression levels of COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, 
NF-kB, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by real time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) whereas, PGE2 and TNF-α levels in serum 
samples were measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, 
radiographs of hind paws and histological changes in ankle joint were analyzed 
in adjuvant injected rats. The anti-oxidant activity of plant extract and 
fractions was evaluated using DPPH and reducing power assays. In addition, 
phytochemistry, total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and HPLC analysis of most 
active fraction (aqueous fraction) were performed.
RESULTS: Results showed that RO extract and fractions (notably aqueous fraction) 
significantly reduced protein denaturation and protected erythrocyte membrane in 
concentration dependent manner. Similarly, extract/fractions induced 
dose-dependent decrease in paw volume/diameter in the formaldehyde model. Plant 
extract and fractions significantly suppressed paw swelling and arthritic score, 
prevented cachexia and remarkably ameliorated hematological and biochemical 
changes. Furthermore, RO extract/fractions downregulated gene expression levels 
of PGE2, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, NF-kB and TNF-α whereas, upregulated those of IL-4 
and IL-10, compared with FCA control rats. The radiographic and histopathologic 
improvement in joint architecture was also observed in RO treated rats. 
Piroxicam, used as reference drug, also significantly suppressed arthritis. 
Additionally, plant exhibited notable anti-oxidant activity and phytochemical 
analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols.
CONCLUSION: Results indicated that suppression of pro-inflammatory 
enzymes/cytokines, inhibition of protein denaturation, lysosomal membrane 
stabilizing abilities, and redox/free radical scavenging properties of RO 
extract and fractions support anti-arthritic and immunomodulatory property of 
Ribes orientale that might be due to its polyphenolic and flavonoid 
constituents. This suggests that Ribes orientale roots may be used as a 
therapeutic agent for treating human arthritis.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic 
autoimmune disease characterized by failure of spontaneous resolution of 
inflammation. The stem of Kadsura heteroclite (KHS) is a well-known 
anti-arthritic Tujia ethnomedicinal plant, which named Xuetong in folk, has long 
been used for the prevention and treatment of rheumatic and arthritic diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and the potential 
mechanisms behind such effects of KHS would be investigated by using different 
animal models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The abdominal writhing episodes of mice induced by 
intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid and the tail-flick response induced by 
radiant heat stimulation were used to evaluate the analgesic effect of KHS. The 
number of abdominal writhing episodes of mice and the latency of tail-flick in 
rats were measured and recorded. In acute inflammatory models, the ear edema of 
mice was induced by applying xylene on the ear surface, while the paw edema of 
male and female rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of carrageenan into 
the right hind paws of animals. The carrageenan-induced paw swelling in rats 
were selected as an anti-acute inflammatory mechanism of KHS. Serum levels of 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) 
were measured by ELISA, and protein expression of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were 
detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The maximal tolerated single dose of KHS was determined to be 26 g/kg 
in both sexes of mice. Pharmacological studies showed that KHS at the dose of 
200 mg/kg significantly prolonged the reaction time of rats to radiant heat 
stimulation and suppressed abdominal writhing episodes of mice induced by 
intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. KHS at the dose of 200, 400, and 
800 mg/kg, showed dose-dependent inhibition of xylene-induced ear swelling in 
mice. KHS at the dose of 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg demonstrated dose- and 
time-dependent suppression of paw edema induced by subcutaneous injection of 
carrageenan in both all rats. Mechanistic studies revealed that the 
anti-inflammatory effect of KHS was associated with inhibition of the production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and effectively decreased 
the expression of COX and iNOS proteins in the carrageenan-injected rat serum, 
paw tissues and inflammatory exudates. The positive reference drug, rotundine at 
a dosage of 100 mg/kg and indomethacin at a dosage of 10 mg/kg were used in both 
mice and rat models.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that KHS has significant effects on 
analgesia and anti-inflammation with decreasing the pro-inflammation cytokines 
of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and inhibiting the proteins expression of COX-2 and 
iNOS.

Inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), stands out as one of 
the main sources of pain and impairment to the quality of life. The use of 
hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH; Hp), an inverse agonist of type 1 cannabinoid receptor, 
has proven to be effective in producing analgesia in pain models, but its effect 
on neuro-inflammatory aspects of RA is limited. In this study, antigen-induced 
arthritis (AIA) was evoked by the intraarticular (i.art.) injection of 
methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) in male Sprague Dawley rats. Phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS)-injected ipsilateral knee joints or AIA contralateral were 
used as control. Nociceptive and inflammatory parameters such as knee joint 
oedema and leukocyte influx and histopathological changes were carried out in 
addition to the local measurement of interleukins (IL) IL-6, IL-1β, tumor 
necrosis factor-α and the immunoreactivity of the neuropeptides substance P (SP) 
and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the spinal cord (lumbar L3-5 
segments) of AIA rats. For 4 days, AIA rats were treated daily with a single 
administration of saline, Hp injected (10 or 20 μg/day, i.art.), Hp given orally 
(20 μg/Kg, p.o.) or indomethacin (Indo; 5 mg/Kg, i.p.). In comparison to the PBS 
control group, the induction of AIA produced a significant and progressive 
mono-arthritis condition. The degree of AIA severity progressively compromised 
the normal walking pattern and impaired mobility over the next four days in 
relation to PBS-injected rats or contralateral knee joints. In AIA rats, the 
reduction of the distance between footprints and disturbances of gait evidenced 
signs of nociception. This response worsened at day 4, and a loss of footprint 
from the ipsilateral hind paw was evident. Daily treatment of the animals with 
Hp either i.art. (10 and 20 μg/knee) or p.o. (20 μg/Kg) as well as Indo 
(5 mg/Kg, i.p.) ameliorated the impaired mobility in a time-dependent manner 
(P < 0.05). In parallel, the AIA-injected ipsilateral knee joints reach a peak 
of swelling 24 h after AIA induction, which persisted over the next four days in 
relation to PBS-injected rats or contralateral knee joints. There was a 
significant but not dose-dependent inhibitory effect produced by all dosages and 
routes of Hp treatments on AIA-induced knee joint swelling (P < 0.05). In 
addition, the increased synovial levels of MPO activity, total leukocytes number 
and IL-6, but not IL-1β, were significantly reduced by the lower i.art. dose of 
Hp. In conclusion, these results successfully demonstrate that Hp may represent 
a novel therapeutic strategy to treat RA, an effect which is unrelated to the 
proinflammatory actions of the neuropeptides CGRP and SP.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects of sepiapterin 
reductase (SPR) inhibition in a mouse model of inflammatory joint disease, and 
to determine whether urinary sepiapterin levels, as measured in mice and healthy 
human volunteers, could be useful as a noninvasive, translational biomarker of 
SPR inhibition/target engagement.
METHODS: The collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model was used to induce 
joint inflammation in mice. The effects of pharmacologic inhibition of SPR on 
thresholds of heat-, cold-, and mechanical-evoked pain sensitivity and on signs 
of inflammation were tested in mice with CAIA. In addition, mice and healthy 
human volunteers were treated with SPR inhibitors, and changes in urinary 
sepiapterin levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: CAIA in mice was characterized by 2 phases: in the acute inflammation 
(early) phase, joint inflammation and heat-, mechanical-, and cold-induced pain 
hypersensitivity were present, while in the postinflammation (late) phase, no 
joint inflammation was observed but heat- and mechanical-induced 
hypersensitivity, but not cold hypersensitivity, were present. Inhibition of SPR 
in mice with CAIA significantly attenuated the heat-induced hyperalgesia in both 
phases, and the mechanical allodynia in the late phase. Signs of inflammation 
were unaffected by SPR inhibition. Urinary tetrahydrobiopterin levels, as a 
marker of inflammatory pain, were increased during inflammation in mice with 
CAIA (2-fold increase over controls; P < 0.05) and significantly reduced by SPR 
inhibition (P < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice). Increased urinary sepiapterin 
levels in the presence of SPR inhibition in both mice and healthy human 
volunteers were associated with high sensitivity (70-85%) and high specificity 
(82-88%) for the prediction of SPR inhibition/target engagement.
CONCLUSION: SPR inhibition reduces the pain associated with joint inflammation, 
thus showing its potential utility as an analgesic strategy for inflammatory 
joint pain. In addition, SPR inhibition increases urinary sepiapterin levels, 
indicating the potential of this measurement as a noninvasive biomarker of 
target engagement of SPR inhibitors, such as sulfasalazine, a disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drug that is currently used as a first-line treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) causes liver dysfunction and is 
associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation is associated 
not only with the development of NAFLD, but also with hepatic diseases, 
including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Auranofin is 
a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and has recently been reported to have 
potential effects against a variety of diseases, including inflammation, cancer, 
and viral infection. In this study, auranofin may be considered as a new 
treatment for the management of metabolic syndrome, as well as in the treatment 
of NAFLD through immunomodulation. To determine the effect of auranofin on 
NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were randomly grouped, fed a regular diet or a high fat diet 
(HFD), and injected with normal saline or auranofin for 8 weeks. Auranofin 
significantly decreased the body weight, epididymal fat weight, serum aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), and glucose, as well as the serum triglyceride, 
cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as compared to the 
HFD group. We also observed that hepatic steatosis was increased in the HFD 
group and was suppressed by auranofin treatment. In addition, auranofin 
suppressed the expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, and the 
NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) in the liver tissue. 
Furthermore, the expression of NADPH oxidase 4 and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which are a major source of oxidative 
stress and a regulator of adipogenesis, respectively, were also decreased by 
auranofin. In addition, primary mouse hepatocytes were incubated with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and palmitic acid (PA) to induce lipid accumulation and 
hepatic inflammation for an in vitro model. Auranofin could significantly 
inhibit LPS- and PA-induced inflammatory activity including nitric oxide and 
NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cytokines. The results of this study demonstrate 
that auranofin treatment inhibits the characteristics of NAFLD through the 
inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, auranofin may have potential as a 
candidate for improving NAFLD symptoms.

AIMS: Leflunomide is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) beneficial 
in refractory cases of rheumatoid arthritis. Since leflunomide approval, 
hepatotoxicity and instructions of liver function monitoring have been 
recommended. The current work aimed to explore the possible role of inflammation 
in leflunomide-induced hepatotoxicity with a focus on the TLR4-mediated 
stimulation of PI3K/mTOR/NFκB pathway.
MAIN METHODS: Forty-eight male albino mice were allocated into four different 
groups (n; 12 mice/group). Group (i): normal mice, Group (ii-iv) mice received 
escalating dosed/s of leflunomide (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) every 48 h for 
eight weeks. At the end of the study, mice were sacrificed, and blood samples 
were collected for determination of liver enzymes. Liver samples were collected; 
(1) formalin-fixed for histologic examination, (2) frozen for PI3K and mTOR 
genes PCR assays.
KEY FINDINGS: Results indicated a significant elevation of liver enzymes in 
leflunomide-treated mice (10 mg/kg); AST and ALT activities were 
218.17 ± 6.83 U/L and 99.83 ± 9.82 U/L versus 130.5 ± 12.79 U/L and 
44.72 ± 3.58 U/L in the vehicle group. Additionally, histopathological 
examination revealed higher necro-inflammatory scores in leflunomide-treated 
mice. Immunohistochemistry indicated dose-dependent increased staining of TLR4 
and caspase 3. Furthermore, leflunomide-treated mice (5 or 10 mg/kg) showed 
greater staining for NFκB compared to vehicle control. RT-PCR results revealed 
upregulations in genes expressing PI3K and mTOR by leflunomide.
SIGNIFICANCE: The current study highlights the possible role of 
TLR4-PI3K/mTOR/NFκB in the pathogenesis of leflunomide-induced hepatic injury. A 
better understanding of mechanisms of leflunomide-induced hepatotoxicity may be 
of translational implication for the predictive, preventive and therapeutic 
purposes.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rhododendron molle G. Don (Ericaceae) (RM) is a 
natural medicinal plant. Its root extracts have been applied in clinic and 
proved to be effective in chronic glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis in 
China. Surprising, little is understood about the key compound of RM and the 
exact mechanisms underlying its treatment on kidney diseases. In this study, we 
will explore whether rhodojaponin II (R-II), as the important compound of RM, 
also exerts the major effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was 
induced by single dose of adriamycin injection. Induced adriamycin nephropathy 
(ADRN) mice were treated individually with RM root extract (5 mg/kg, n = 5), RM 
root extract (60 mg/kg, n = 5), R-II (0.04 mg/kg, n = 6) or captopril (30 mg/kg, 
n = 5) for five weeks. Podocyte marker (nephrin and podocin) expressions were 
examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western Blot analysis. Fibronectin 
level was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and Western Blot analysis. 
Interstitial infiltrated inflammatory cells (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and 
CD68+ macrophages) were examined with immunohistochemical staining. The 
expressions of NF-ĸB p-p65 and TGF-β1/Smad pathway associated key proteins, such 
as TGF-β1, Smad3, phosphorylated-Smad3 (p-Smad3), and Smad7, were analyzed 
respectively by Western Blot analysis.
RESULTS: RM root extract (5 mg/kg) and its important compound R-II (0.04 mg/kg) 
significantly ameliorated proteinuria, podocyte injury, and glomerulosclerosis, 
meanwhile, they hampered interstitial fibrosis in mice with ADRN. R-II 
significantly reduced NF-ĸB p65 phosphorylation, interstitial infiltrated CD4+ T 
cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD68+ macrophages, at the same time, down-regulated 
TGF-β1 and p-Smad3 protein expressions in mice with ADRN.
CONCLUSION: RM root extract, R-II, could effectively ameliorate proteinuria and 
kidney injury in ADRN, related to its anti-inflammatory effects, as well as 
suppression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized 
by synovial inflammation and progressive joint destruction. Chebulanin is a 
natural polyphenol acid isolated from the traditional Tibetan medicine 
Terminalia chebula Retz that has previously been reported to possess 
anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to investigate the 
anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects of chebulanin and explore its 
underlying mechanisms in vivo and in vitro using a collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA) mouse model and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 cell 
inflammation model. Arthritis severity scores were assessed twice weekly; the 
levels of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in 
serum were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits; 
histopathological assessment was performed using micro computed tomography and 
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were assessed using 
western blotting. The inhibition of translocation of cytosolic p38 and p65 into 
the nucleus was observed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting 
in vitro. Chebulanin significantly suppressed the progression and development of 
RA in CIA mice by decreasing the arthritis severity scores, attenuating paw 
swelling and joint destruction, and reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α 
significantly (p < 0.05). Furthermore, chebulanin reduced the levels of excised 
phosphorylated (p)-p38, phosphorylated-c-JUN N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-p65 
and phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor alpha (p-IκBα) in CIA mice, but did not 
affect the level of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). 
In addition, chebulanin could inhibit the nuclear translocation of p38 and p65 
in LPS-stimulated macrophages in dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, this 
study demonstrated that chebulanin exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic 
effects by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION: A pivotal effect of lymphatic vessel (LV) function in joint 
homeostasis was identified in the tumor necrosis factor-transgenic (TNF-Tg) 
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Specifically, loss of LV contractions 
is associated with progressive synovitis and erosions. Furthermore, draining 
lymph node expansion is a biomarker of arthritic progression, and both 
macrophages and lymphatic endothelial cells express inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS), which disrupts LV contraction and transport of immune cells to 
the draining lymph nodes. Therefore, to directly assess these relationships, we 
tested the hypothesis that TNF-Tg mice with global genetic ablation of iNOS 
(iNOS-/-) will show delayed draining lymph node expansion, maintained LV 
contractions, and decreased synovitis and erosions.
METHOD: iNOS-/-× TNF-Tg female and male mice, and control littermates (iNOS-/-, 
TNF-Tg, and WT), were examined with (1) ultrasound to determine popliteal lymph 
node (PLN) volume and (2) near-infrared imaging (NIR) to assess popliteal LV 
contraction frequency, and differences between genotypes were assessed at 3, 4, 
5, and 6 months of age. Knees and PLN were harvested at 4 months in females and 
6 months in males, to assess synovitis, bone erosions, and cellular accumulation 
in PLN sinuses via histology.
RESULTS: Initially, an increase in PLN volume was observed for both female and 
male iNOS-/-× TNF-Tg and TNF-Tg compared to their WT and iNOS-/- counterparts at 
2 and 3 months, respectively. Subsequently, TNF-Tg PLNs continue to increase in 
volume, while iNOS-/-× TNF-Tg did not increase in volume from the initial 
timepoints. WT and iNOS-/- PLN volume was unchanged throughout the experiment. 
LV contraction frequency was increased at 4 months in females and 5 months in 
males, in the iNOS-/-× TNF-Tg mice compared to the TNF-Tg. Synovitis and 
erosions were moderately reduced in iNOS-/-× TNF-Tg versus TNF-Tg knees in 
females, while no differences in knee pathology were observed in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic iNOS ablation maintains draining lymph node volume and LV 
function during TNF-induced inflammatory arthritis and is associated with 
moderately decreased joint inflammation and damage.

In clinical medicine, indomethacin (IND, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) 
is used variously in the treatment of severe osteoarthritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, gouty arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. A common complication 
found alongside the therapeutic characteristics is gastric mucosal damage. This 
complication is mediated through apoptosis and autophagy of the gastrointestinal 
mucosal epithelium. Apoptosis and autophagy are critical homeostatic pathways 
catalysed by caspases downstream of the gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial 
injury. Both act through molecular signalling pathways characterized by the 
initiation, mediation, execution and regulation of the cell regulatory cycle. In 
this study we hypothesized that dysregulated apoptosis and autophagy are 
associated with IND-induced gastric damage. We examined the spectra of in vivo 
experimental gastric ulcers in male Sprague-Dawley rats through gastric gavage 
of IND. Following an 18-hour fast, IND was administered to experimental rats. 
They were sacrificed at 3-, 6- and 12-hour intervals. Parietal cells (H+ , K+ 
-ATPase β-subunit assay) and apoptosis (TUNEL assay) were determined. The 
expression of apoptosis-signalling caspase (caspases 3, 8, 9 and 12), DNA damage 
(anti-phospho-histone H2A.X) and autophagy (MAP-LC3, LAMP-1 and cathepsin 
B)-related molecules in gastric mucosal cells was examined. The administration 
of IND was associated with gastric mucosal erosions and ulcerations mainly 
involving the gastric parietal cells (PCs) of the isthmic and upper neck regions 
and a time-dependent gradual increase in the number of apoptotic PCs with the 
induction of both apoptotic (upregulation of caspases 3 and 8) cell death and 
autophagic (MAP-LC3-II, LAMP-1 and cathepsin B) cell death. Autophagy induced by 
fasting and IND 3 hours initially prompted the degradation of caspase 8. After 6 
and 12 hours, damping down of autophagic activity occurred, resulting in the 
upregulation of active caspase 8 and its nuclear translocation. In conclusion we 
report that IND can induce time-dependent apoptotic and autophagic cell death of 
PCs. Our study provides the first indication of the interactions between these 
two homeostatic pathways in this context.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Periploca sepium Bunge (P. sepium) is used in 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, 
particularly rheumatoid arthritis. Periploca sepium periplosides (PePs), 
isolated from the root bark of P. sepium, characterized as the cardiac 
glycosides-free pregnane glycosides fraction, is expected to possess therapeutic 
potential on inflammatory arthritis.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study is designed to evaluate the 
anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities effects of the 
PePs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-nociceptive activity of PePs was examined in the 
writhing test and hot-plate test in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity of PePs 
was determined by the 2, 4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced ear edema 
model and the carrageenan induced paw edema model in mice. The anti-arthritic 
activity of PePs was investigated by evaluating the joint inflammation and 
arthritis pathology in rat adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) and murine collagen 
induced arthritis (CIA). Phytohaemagglutinin M (PHA-M) -elicited human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were further applied to assess the 
suppressive activity of PePs on IFN-γ and IL-17 production.
RESULTS: PePs treatment markedly decreased the acetic acid-induced visceral 
nociceptive response and increased the hot-plate pain threshold. Further, oral 
administration of PePs exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing 
DNFB-induced ear edema in mice and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. 
Moreover, oral treatment of PePs ameliorated joint swelling and attenuated bone 
erosion in rodent arthritis, and the therapeutic benefits were partially 
attributed to the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such IFN-γ and IL-17. 
Moreover, PePs suppressed the proliferation as well as IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion 
in PHA-M-elicited human PBMCs in a concentration dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results justified the traditional use of 
Periploca sepium Bunge for the treatment of diseases associated with 
inflammation and pain.

OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis is a multisystemic inflammatory disease 
characterized by destruction of the joints. An effective treatment method of the 
disease has not been developed yet. The aim of the present study is to evaluate 
the effects of bee (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) venom (BV) on serum inflammatory 
parameters, serum antioxidant load and clinical parameters of experimentally 
induced adjuvant arthritis in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 35 Wistar albino male rats were used. The 
animals were divided into 5 groups. First group animals served as negative 
controls. The second, third, fourth and fifth groups were used for experimental 
arthritis induction. Following clinical development of arthritis, the first 
group was subcutaneously administered 0.2 ml of physiological saline, and the 
second, third and fourth groups were treated subcutaneously with 2 µg/kg, 4 
µg/kg and 20 µg/kg once a week three times. Physiological saline injected fifth 
group animals were used as a sham-treatment group. Clinical observations and 
evaluation of arthritis were made at the 15th day, and at the end of the 
experiment. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, paraoxonase, serum aryl esterase, 
high-sensitivity C reactive protein, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 
(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were determined in cardiac blood 
samples taken at the end of the 29th day.
RESULTS: From the data, total oxidant level (TOL) and oxidative stress index 
(OSI) were calculated. Significant improvements were observed in the clinical 
signs of arthritis and inflammatory markers such as in IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and 
TOL and OSI in the 20.0 µg/kg BV-administered group. Bee venom administration 
did not cause any significant increase in ALT and AST values or signs of liver 
toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Bee venom treatment was effective in alleviation of symptoms of the 
experimental rat adjuvant arthritis by means of clinical observation and serum 
inflammatory markers.

OBJECTIVE: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 
(MALT-1) plays a crucial role in innate and adaptive immune signaling by 
modulating the threshold for activation of immune cells, including Treg cells. 
Therefore, MALT-1 is regarded to be an interesting therapeutic target in several 
immune-mediated diseases. The goal of this study was to examine the role of 
MALT-1 in experimental animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: MALT-1 activation was assessed by measuring cleavage of the 
deubiquitinase CYLD in lymphocytes from mice with collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). Furthermore, the impact of MALT-1 deficiency on arthritis was evaluated 
in Malt1KO mice with CIA or with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). T 
cell-specific MALT-1 deficiency was measured in mice with deletion of T 
cell-specific MALT-1 (Malt1Tcell KO ), and the time-dependent effects of MALT-1 
deficiency were assessed in mice with deletion of tamoxifen-inducible T 
cell-specific MALT-1 (Malt1iTcell KO ). Bone density was determined in 
MALT-1-deficient mice using micro-computed tomography and femur-bending tests. 
Reconstitution of Treg cells was performed using adoptive transfer experiments.
RESULTS: MALT-1 activation was observed in the lymphocytes of mice with CIA. T 
cell-specific MALT-1 deletion in the induction phase of arthritis (incidence of 
arthritis, 25% in control mice versus 0% in Malt1iTcell KO mice; P < 0.05), but 
not in the effector phase of arthritis, completely protected mice against the 
development of CIA. Consistent with this finding, MALT-1 deficiency had no 
impact on CAIA, an effector phase model of RA. Finally, mice with MALT-1 
deficiency showed a spontaneous decrease in bone density (mean ± SEM trabecular 
thickness, 46.3 ± 0.7 μm in control mice versus 40 ± 1.1 μm in Malt1KO mice; P < 
0.001), which was linked to the loss of Treg cells in these mice.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these data in murine models of RA highlight MALT-1 as a 
master regulator of T cell activation, which is relevant to the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune arthritis. Furthermore, these findings show that MALT-1 deficiency 
can lead to spontaneous osteoporosis, which is associated with impaired Treg 
cell numbers.

BACKGROUND: Many bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid 
arthritis are commonly associated with the excessive activity of osteoclasts. 
Polyscias fruticosa has been used as traditional medicine for the treatment of 
ischemia and inflammation and also eaten as a salad. However, its effect on the 
bone related diseases has not been investigated yet.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of ethanol extract of P. 
fruticosa on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and LPS-induced bone loss 
in mouse, and evaluate anti-osteoclastogenic activities of its major 
constituents.
METHODS: BMMs or RAW264.7 cells were treated with ethanol extract from P. 
fruticose leaves (EEPL), followed by an evaluation of cell viability, 
RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, actin-ring formation, and resorption 
pits activity. Effects of EEPL on RANKL-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs were 
evaluated by Western blotting. The expression levels of NFATc1 and c-Fos were 
evaluated by Western blotting or immunofluorescence assay. The expression levels 
of osteoclast-specific marker genes were evaluated by Western blotting and 
reverse transcription-qPCR analysis. A LPS-induced murine bone loss model was 
used to evaluate the protective effect of EEPL on inflammation-induced bone 
loss. HPLC analysis was performed to identify the major constituents of EEPL.
RESULTS: EEPL significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation 
by decreasing the number of osteoclasts, osteoclast actin-ring formation, and 
bone resorption. EEPL suppressed RANKL-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK 
MAPKs, as well as the expression of c-Fos and NFATc1. EEPL decreased the 
expression levels of osteoclast marker genes, including MMP-9, TRAP and CtsK. 
Mice treated with EEPL significantly protected the mice from LPS-induced 
osteoclast formation and bone destruction as indicated by micro-CT and 
histological analysis of femurs. We also identified 
3-O-[β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-d-glucuronopyranosyl] oleanolic acid 
28-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (1) and quercitrin (3) as the active constituents 
in EEPL for inhibiting RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that EEPL exerted anti-osteoclastogenic activity 
in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and 
function, and suggested that EEPL could have beneficial applications for 
preventing or inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone diseases.

The complement system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). Besides driving lectin pathway (LP) activation, the 
mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases (MASPs) also play a key 
role in regulating the alternative pathway (AP). We evaluated the effects of 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated MASP-1 and MASP-2 duplexes in vitro 
and in mice with and without arthritis to examine whether knockdown of MASP-1 
and MASP-2 expression affects the development of arthritis. GalNAc-siRNAs for 
MASP-1 and MASP-2 demonstrated robust silencing of MASP-1 or MASP-2 at pM 
concentrations in vitro. To evaluate the impact of silencing in arthritic mice, 
we used the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) mouse model of RA. Mice 
were injected a 10 mg/kg dose of GalNAc-siRNAs 3x s.q. prior to the induction of 
CAIA. Liver gene expression was examined using qRT-PCR, and protein levels were 
confirmed in the circulation by sandwich immunoassays and Western blot. At day 
10, CAIA mice separately treated with MASP-1 and MASP-2 duplexes had a specific 
reduction in expression of liver MASP-1 (70-95%, p < 0.05) and MASP-2 (90%, p < 
0.05) mRNA, respectively. MASP-1-siRNA treatment resulted in a 95% reduction in 
levels of MASP-1 protein in circulation with no effect on MASP-2 levels and 
clinical disease activity (CDA). In mice injected with MASP-2 duplex, there was 
a significant (p < 0.05) 90% decrease in ex vivo C4b deposition on mannan, with 
nearly complete elimination of MASP-2 in the circulation. MASP-2 silencing 
initially significantly decreased CDA by 60% but subsequently changed to a 40% 
decrease vs. control. Unexpectedly, GalNAc-siRNA-mediated knockdown of MASP-1 
and MASP-2 revealed a marked effect of these proteins on the transcription of FD 
under normal physiological conditions, whereas LPS-induced inflammatory 
conditions reversed this effect on FD levels. LPS is recognized by Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4), we found MBL not only binds to TLR4 an interaction with a Kd 
of 907 nM but also upregulated FD expression in differentiated adipocytes. We 
show that MASP-2 knockdown impairs the development of RA and that the 
interrelationship between proteins of the LP and the AP may extend to the 
transcriptional modulation of the FD gene.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Periploca forrestii Schltr. (PF) is a 
traditional folk medicine in China that has been used widely for treating 
rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic injuries for a long history. Previously, we 
have roughly demonstrated that the ethanol extract of PF possessed in vitro 
wound healing potential, and more in depth research deserves to be conducted.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is aiming to fully evaluate the wound 
healing activity of PF in vitro and in vivo, clarify the mechanism of actions 
and the primary constituents responsible for wound healing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total extract of Periploca forrestii Schltr. (EPF) 
and its fraction (65% ethanol fraction, EPFE65) were obtained and evaluated on 
in vitro wound healing properties using mouse dermal fibroblasts (L929). Cell 
proliferation was tested by MTT and EdU assay, confirmed by cell cycle analysis, 
cell migration was evaluated by scratch and transwell assay and collagen 
production was also determined. Then EPFE65 was tested on in vivo wound healing 
activity using the excision rat models. The wounded skin of rats was topically 
applied with 0.1% EPFE65 once daily for 6 days with hydrogel as the carrier and 
the recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor hydrogel (rbFGF) as 
positive control. Histopathology of the wounded skin on day 6 and day 12 was 
studied via hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The expression of 
phosphorylation of Src, Akt and Erk1/2 was determined after the treatment with 
EPFE65 by western blot. In order to figure out whether the activation of Src, 
Akt and Erk1/2 was directly in conjunction with wound healing process promoted 
by EPFE65, cell proliferation and migration were tested in the presence of three 
inhibitors of Src, Akt and Erk1/2. Finally, the chemical composition of the 
effective fraction EPFE65 was analyzed by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS.
RESULTS: In vitro experiments suggested that EPFE65 was comparable to EPF that 
had potent effect on promoting L929 fibroblasts proliferation, migration and 
increasing collagen production. 0.1% EPFE65 hydrogel also exhibited significant 
effect on promoting wound healing in rats. The wound closure was significantly 
faster in EPFE65 and positive rbFGF group than that in negative control group 
since the third day post wounding (p < 0.05). Specifically, on day10-12, the 
wounds in EPFE65 and rbFGF group were almost healed as the wound areas 
diminished into 13.3-5.3% and 7.7-4.0%, while the wound in control group was 
still apparent with 36.8-22.1% wound area. HE staining demonstrated that EPFE65 
and rbFGF group could advance re-epithelialization in the early days and promote 
the transition of granulation tissue into complete dermis tissue with more skin 
appendages resembling those of normal skin in the last days. Western blot 
results suggested that the active fraction EPFE65 could increase the 
phosphorylation of Src, Akt and Erk1/2 in both dose-dependent and time-dependent 
manner, whereas Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation caused by EPFE65 could be 
abolished by Src inhibition. Inhibition experiments confirmed that the 
activation of Src, Akt and Erk1/2 were involved in cell proliferation and 
migration. All of these demonstrated that EPFE65 promoted wound healing at least 
in part via Src mediated Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Analysis of 
chemical composition of EPFE65 revealed that cardiac glycosides were major 
components in EPFE65, among which periplocin showed effectiveness on promoting 
fibroblasts proliferation indicating that cardiac glycosides in EPFE65 maybe the 
active compounds responsible for wound healing.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that EPFE65, ethanol extract of 
Periploca forrestii Schltr. could accelerate wound healing in vitro and in vivo 
through Src meditated Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.

Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a novel method for gene 
transfection. The aim of the present study was to identify the most suitable 
method of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor (TNFR) gene transfection using 
UTMD for systemically treating a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). 
Plasmids encoding the TNFR and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with or 
without microbubbles were locally injected into the skeletal muscle and synovial 
membrane of CIA rats. The rats were divided into the following 6 groups: i) 
Group 1, plasmid + microbubble + ultrasound (muscle group); ii) group 2, plasmid 
+ microbubble + ultrasound (joint group); iii) group 3, plasmid + ultrasound; 
iv) group 4, plasmid + microbubble; v) group 5, plasmid only and; vi) group 6, 
untreated controls. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The 
transfection efficiency of the plasmids in the muscle or synovium was observed 
by fluorescence microscopy. Arthritis scores were calculated and serum levels of 
TNF-α were measured prior to and following treatment. Bilateral ankle joints 
were obtained and stained to observe synovial inflammation and the expression of 
TNF-α. EGFP expression was detected in all treated groups at each time point, 
and the fluorescence intensity of groups 1 and 2 was significantly greater than 
that of the other groups (P<0.05). For groups 1 and 2, the reductions in joint 
scores and serum levels of TNF-α were significant compared with the other groups 
(P<0.05). The number of synovial inflammatory cells and the synovial expression 
of TNF-α presented similar results among all experimental groups and no 
significant difference was observed between groups 1 and 2. Therefore, the 
results of the present study suggest that UTMD significantly enhanced the 
efficiency of TNFR gene transfection in the muscle and inflamed synovium of rats 
with. Regardless of whether the transfected TNFR gene was injected into the 
muscle or joint, it was continuously expressed in the rats for at least 8 weeks, 
which may improve arthritic symptoms and reduce the levels of inflammatory 
factors in the synovial tissues and peripheral blood.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Albizia procera L. (Leguminosae) commonly known 
as Konda vagai in Tamil, is used for the treatment of stomach and intestinal 
disorders. A decoction of the bark is prescribed for rheumatism and haemorrhage. 
Traditionally, literature claims Albizia procera as a drug to have antirheumatic 
properties and hence used by Tribal for the management of chronic rheumatism. 
Consequently, the present study has been undertaken to illustrate the beneficial 
outcome of Albizia procera in adjuvant induced arthritic rat model with respect 
to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study is aimed to investigate the oxidative stress 
and the expression of inflammatory markers in arthritic rats treated with 
ethanolic bark extract of Albizia procera.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanolic bark extract was characterized by HPTLC 
analysis. Acute oral toxicity study was performed according to the OECD test 
guideline 423 - Acute toxic class method. The anti-inflammatory effect of ETBE 
(100, 200 mg/kg/day/p.o.) was evaluated in complete Freund's adjuvant induced 
arthritic rats using diclofenac as positive control (0.3 mg/kg/day/p. o.). 
Plasma levels of interleukins TNF- α, IFN-α, IL-2, IL-6, myeloperoxidase and 
Cathepsin D levels were measured to assess the inflammatory effect of ETBE 
extract of Albizia procera. Further, the effect of ETBE on superoxide dismutase 
(SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid 
peroxidation (LPO) were assessed in plasma.
RESULTS: HPTLC analysis showed the presence of 0.57% w/w of biochanin-A in ETBE. 
ETBE did not show any toxic signs up to 2000 mg/kg body weight. It exhibited the 
significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential and did not show 
mortality up to 2000 mg/kg body weight. ETBE treatment significantly reduced the 
levels of TNF- α, IFN-α, IL-2, IL-6 and myeloperoxidase, and increased cathepsin 
D levels compared to vehicle treated animals. SOD, GSH and GPX levels were 
significantly restored to normal levels while LPO was significantly reduced at 
200 mg/kg b. wt. Treated animals. Histopathological studies showed complete 
cartilage regeneration and near normal joint in ETBE treated arthritic rats.
CONCLUSION: ETBE demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity by modulating 
the expression of inflammatory cytokines and restoring the antioxidant enzyme 
levels.

Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced accumulation of mitochondrial damage has been 
widely implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. 
Mitophagy plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged mitochondria, and is 
governed by the PINK1 (PTEN induced putative protein kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR 
E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway. Although both increased PINK1 and reduced 
PRKN have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis in association with mitophagy, 
there are conflicting reports for the role of mitophagy in COPD progression. To 
clarify the involvement of PRKN-regulated mitophagy in COPD pathogenesis, prkn 
knockout (KO) mouse models were used. To illuminate how PINK1 and PRKN regulate 
mitophagy in relation to CS-induced mitochondrial damage and cellular 
senescence, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in airway 
epithelial cells (AEC). In comparison to wild-type mice, prkn KO mice 
demonstrated enhanced airway wall thickening with emphysematous changes 
following CS exposure. AEC in CS-exposed prkn KO mice showed accumulation of 
damaged mitochondria and increased oxidative modifications accompanied by 
accelerated cellular senescence. In vitro experiments showed PRKN overexpression 
was sufficient to induce mitophagy during CSE exposure even in the setting of 
reduced PINK1 protein levels, resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial ROS 
production and cellular senescence. Conversely PINK1 overexpression failed to 
recover impaired mitophagy caused by PRKN knockdown, indicating that PRKN 
protein levels can be the rate-limiting factor in PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy 
during CSE exposure. These results suggest that PRKN levels may play a pivotal 
role in COPD pathogenesis by regulating mitophagy, suggesting that PRKN 
induction could mitigate the progression of COPD. Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg, known as 
the Chinese tulip tree, has a long history of cultivation and utilization in 
many Asia countries, especially in China to use in traditional Chinese medicine 
for expelling "wind and dampness", a term corresponding to rheumatic fever and 
rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, the barks of Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) 
Sarg was also found in folk to treat gout. However, further experimental studies 
remained to confirm its uric acid-lowering effects.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of 
ethanol extract of the barks of Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg (EELC) in a 
mouse model of hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) and the involved mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: EELC at a respective dose of 250 mg/kg/d or 500 mg/kg/d 
were orally administered to HN mice induced by a mixture of adenine 
(160 mg/kg/d)/potassium oxonate (2.4 g/kg/d) for 21 days. At the end of the 
treatment, serum uric acid, kidney functions (serum creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen and urine microalbumin), 24-h urine uric acid excretion, as well as 
kidney pathological changes were investigated by biochemical assay, 
histopathological score, immunofluorescence and histochemistry, RT-qPCR, and 
western blotting analysis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Oral administration of EELC significantly lowered serum 
uric acid level at 500 mg/kg (185.75 ± 15.49 μmol/L of EELC vs. 
238.28 ± 20.97 μmol/L of HN model, p < 0.01) in HN mice. EELC at 500 mg/kg also 
remarkably reduced the levels of serum creatinine (82.92 ± 7.86 μmol/L of EELC 
vs. 92.08 ± 6.13 μmol/L of HN model, p < 0.0001), blood urea nitrogen 
(21.50 ± 1.87 mmol/L of EELC vs. 29.40 ± 3.95 mmol/L of HN model, p < 0.001) and 
urine microalbumin (4.25 ± 0.40 mg/L of EELC vs. 5.95 ± 0.33 mg/L of HN model, 
p < 0.001) to improve renal function. It also attenuated renal fibrosis, 
especially the high-dose of EELC. Furthermore, EELC could inhibit the activation 
of NF-κB, ASK1/JNK/c-Jun, JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways and reduce the release 
of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in the kidneys of HN mice. Additionally, EELC 
remarkably increased urine uric acid excretion of HN mice, which may be achieved 
by the upregulation of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3 and ATP-binding 
cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: EELC alleviated the progression of HN by suppressing the activation 
of NF-κB, ASK1/JNK/c-Jun and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, reducing the 
infiltration of inflammatory factors and uric acid accumulation in the kidney.

KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating 
autophagy.

University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in myeloid cellular repair, destruction, 
and osteoclast differentiation; conversely, KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) 
regulates myeloid cell activation and differentiation. To investigate the 
specific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in 
monocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine 
(3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and 
adenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells 
and multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, 
GGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these 
processes. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly 
decreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic 
differentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level 
of Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic 
differentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of 
Beclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the 
level of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid 
cell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules 
(CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of 
Becn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone 
activation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and 
overexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In 
addition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 
acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the 
first time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy 
process during osteoclastogenesis.Abbreviations: ACP5/TRAP: acid phosphatase 5,

The aim of this paper was to compare the properties of Tripterygium Glycosides 
Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets from dose-effect-toxicity on type Ⅱ 
collagen-induced arthritis( CIA) in rats. SD rats were randomly divided into 
eight groups,including normal group,model group,Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets 
groups( 1 times equivalent dose 0.009 g·kg-1,4 times equivalent dose 0.036 
g·kg-1,16 times equivalent dose 0.144 g·kg-1),Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets 
groups( 1 times equivalent dose 0.007 5 mg·kg-1,4 times equivalent dose 0.030 
mg·kg-1,16 times equivalent dose 0.120 mg·kg-1). Beginning on the first 
immunization,Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets 
administered intraperitoneally once a day. After the second immunization,the 
symptoms such as redness and swelling of joints were observed,and the clinical 
score and incidence of arthritis were evaluated. HE and Masson staining were 
used to examine the histopathological changes of joints. The expression level of 
anti-type Ⅱ collagen antibody Ig G in serum was detected by ELISA,routine 
testing of blood components,the concentration of ALP( alkaline phosphatase),ALT( 
alanine aminotransferase),AST( aspartate aminotransferase),GGT( 
gamma-glutamyltransferase),TBi L( total bilirubin),CRE( creatinine) and UREA( 
urea) in serum were detected by enzymatic assay. The rate of sperm deformity in 
the epididymis was evaluated under light microscope. The extent of damage to the 
testis and ovarian tissue was assessed by HE staining. Tripterygium Glycosides 
Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets attenuated the 
inflammation,redness,swelling and deformity of joints and reduced the clinical 
score and incidence of arthritis in CIA rats. Meanwhile,it also exhibited 
obvious reduction in all pathological features such as joint 
synovitis,pannus,cartilage erosion and bone destruction. Tripterygium Glycosides 
Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets reduced Ig G in a dose-dependent 
manner,and Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets is better than Tripterygium wilfordii 
Tablets( P<0.05 or P<0.01). The high doses of Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets 
and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets could significantly increase the organ 
coefficient of liver and spleen and reduced RBC and HGB in CIA rats( P<0.01),and 
severity leading to death. Gastric mucosal injury and morphological changes of 
liver and kidney were not observed in CIA rats of Tripterygium Glycosides 
Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets treatment group. The 4 and 16 times 
doses of Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets 
could significantly increase serum ALT,GGT and decrease CRE( P<0.05 or P<0.01). 
Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets could 
increase the sperm deformity rate and damage the testicular seminiferous tubules 
of CIA male rats. Severity increased with dose and time increasing. The effect 
of Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets( 16 times) is more significant than 
Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets( 16 times). Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets and 
Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets significantly delayed onset of arthritis and 
inhibited the paw edema and arthritic score. Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets and 
Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets also caused male reproductive damage,high dose 
affected hematopoiesis,and maximum dose leading to death. Tripterygium 
Glycosides Tablets and Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets all depended on 
dose-effect-toxicity manner. Anti-arthritis effect of Tripterygium Glycosides 
Tablets is better than Tripterygium wilfordii Tablets,but the toxicity of 
Tripterygium Glycosides Tablets maximum dose is more obvious. The relevant 
conclusions of our study will provide experimental references for clinical 
rational use of drugs,and further clinical studies are needed to confirm our 
conclusions.
