Clostridium difficile infection is the leading cause of healthcare-associated 
diarrhoea in Europe and North America. During infection, C. difficile produces 
two key virulence determinants, toxin A and toxin B. Experiments with purified 
toxins have indicated that toxin A alone is able to evoke the symptoms of C. 
difficile infection, but toxin B is unable to do so unless it is mixed with 
toxin A or there is prior damage to the gut mucosa. However, a recent study 
indicated that toxin B is essential for C. difficile virulence and that a strain 
producing toxin A alone was avirulent. This creates a paradox over the 
individual importance of toxin A and toxin B. Here we show that isogenic mutants 
of C. difficile producing either toxin A or toxin B alone can cause fulminant 
disease in the hamster model of infection. By using a gene knockout system to 
inactivate the toxin genes permanently, we found that C. difficile producing 
either one or both toxins showed cytotoxic activity in vitro that translated 
directly into virulence in vivo. Furthermore, by constructing the first ever 
double-mutant strain of C. difficile, in which both toxin genes were 
inactivated, we were able to completely attenuate virulence. Our findings 
re-establish the importance of both toxin A and toxin B and highlight the need 
to continue to consider both toxins in the development of diagnostic tests and 
effective countermeasures against C. difficile.

Toxin-induced Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major disease 
characterized by severe diarrhea and high morbidity rates. The aim with this 
study was to develop an alternative drug for the treatment of CDI. Cows were 
repeatedly immunized to establish specific immunoglobulin G and A titers against 
toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) and against C. difficile cells in mature milk or 
colostrum. The effect of three different concentrations of anti-C. difficile 
whey protein isolates (anti-CD-WPI) and the standard of care antibiotic 
vancomycin were investigated in an animal model of CD infected hamsters (6 
groups, with 10 hamsters each). WPI obtained from the milk of exactly the same 
cows pre-immunization and a vehicle group served as negative controls. The 
survival of hamsters receiving anti-CD-WPI was 50, 80 and 100% compared to 10 
and 0% for the control groups, respectively. Vancomycin suppressed the growth of 
C. difficile and thus protected the hamsters at the time of administration, but 
90% of these hamsters nevertheless died shortly after discontinuation of 
treatment. In contrast, the surviving hamsters of the anti-CD-WPI groups 
survived the entire study period, although they were treated for only 75 h. The 
specific antibodies not only inactivated the toxins for initial suppression of 
CDI, but also provoked the inhibition of C. difficile growth after 
discontinuation, thus preventing recurrence. Oral administration of anti-CD-WPI 
is a functional therapy of CDI in infected hamsters for both primary treatment 
and prevention of recurrence. Thus, anti-CD-WPI could address the urgent unmet 
medical need for treating and preventing recurrent CDI in humans.

Pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile has been linked to production of toxins, 
including the large toxins A and B as well as the binary toxin CDT. Until 
recently, toxin A was only found in combination in clinical strains with the 
toxin B, unlike toxin B or CDT, which were found alone in toxigenic variants. 
New toxigenic variants of C. difficile detected in our laboratory from patients 
with diarrhoea or severe colitis, including a variant producing only toxin A, 
were tested for virulence in the hamster model, which displays the clinical 
features of C. difficile disease. Hamsters infected with a strain producing only 
toxin B induced similar clinical signs, time to death from infection and 
histologic damage compared to the hypervirulent strain 027. No mortality or 
clinical signs of infection but caecal histologic damage was found with the 
variant producing only toxin A. The C. difficile variant strain producing only 
CDT was able to kill one hamster out of seven; nevertheless, the surviving 
animals had few alteration of the caecum.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infection with Clostridium difficile causes nosocomial 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Hamsters historically have been used 
to investigate disease pathogenesis and treatment, but are not ideal models 
because of the lack of hamster-specific reagents and genetically modified 
animals, and because they develop fulminant disease. The aim of this study was 
to establish a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile-associated disease 
(CDAD) that more closely resembles human disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a mixture of antibiotics (kanamycin, 
gentamicin, colistin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) for 3 days. Two days later, 
they were given injections of clindamycin and then challenged 1 day later with 
different doses of C. difficile.
RESULTS: Mice that were exposed to antibiotics and then challenged with C. 
difficile developed diarrhea and lost weight. Disease severity varied from 
fulminant to minimal in accordance with the challenge dose. Typical histologic 
features of CDAD were evident. Oral vancomycin prevented CDAD in all mice, but 
68% died from colitis after treatment was discontinued. All animals that 
survived an initial episode of CDAD showed no evidence of diarrhea or colitis 
after subsequent rechallenge with C. difficile. Different strains of C. 
difficile tested in the model showed different levels of virulence in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a mouse model of CDAD that closely represents the 
human disease. In light of the recent substantial increases in CDAD incidence 
and severity, this model will be valuable in testing new treatments, examining 
disease pathogenesis, and elucidating mechanisms of protective immunity.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative propensities of oritavancin and vancomycin 
to induce Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in hamster and in vitro human 
gut models.
METHODS: Hamsters received clindamycin (100 mg/kg orally or subcutaneously), 
oritavancin (50 mg/kg orally) or vancomycin (50 mg/kg orally). C. difficile 
spores were administered orally the next day. Control hamsters received vehicle 
only (polyethylene glycol 400) plus spores or clindamycin but no spores. 
Hamsters were monitored for clinical signs for 20 days. Caecal contents were 
analysed for C. difficile cells, spores and the presence of (cyto)toxin. 
Oritavancin and vancomycin were instilled over 7 days into separate in vitro gut 
models primed with pooled human faeces and inoculated with C. difficile ribotype 
027 spores. Gut flora, C. difficile total viable and spore counts, toxin titres 
and antimicrobial concentrations were determined.
RESULTS: All hamsters treated with oritavancin survived up to 20 days, with no 
evidence of C. difficile spores, vegetative cells or toxin in their caeca. No 
hamsters treated with clindamycin or vancomycin survived >6 days after spore 
administration. Death was associated with high C. difficile counts and toxin in 
caecal contents. In the gut model, oritavancin dosing elicited a rapid, marked 
decrease in total viable C. difficile and spore counts to below the limit of 
detection. Vancomycin did not elicit germination or toxin production in the gut 
model, but C. difficile remained present as spores throughout.
CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin exposure, unlike exposure to vancomycin or clindamycin, 
did not lead to CDI in hamsters. In both models, oritavancin reduced C. 
difficile total counts and spores to below detectable limits. The data indicate 
the potential of oritavancin for CDI treatment, since exposure did not induce C. 
difficile germination and toxin production, which are known to exacerbate the 
disease state.

Overgrowth of enteric clostridia in dysbiosis in horses with colic is presumed 
but scarcely investigated. The objective was to provide prevalence data of 
Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens in horses with and without 
gastrointestinal disease in Switzerland, and investigate microbiota differences 
between C. difficile shedders and non-shedders. Fecal samples were taken from 
healthy horses (n = 103), horses with colic (n = 98) and horses with diarrhea 
(n = 151). Colic horses were sampled on three days. Selective enrichment culture 
and molecular typing for C. difficile and C. perfringens was performed. 
Microbiota differences between horses with colic shedding (n = 7) and not 
shedding (n = 7) C. difficile were assessed using metagenomic sequencing. The 
cumulative prevalence (19% C. difficile; 16% C. perfringens) was higher compared 
to single day samples (1-10% C. difficile; 3-8% C. perfringens, all p < 0.003). 
Horses with colic shed significantly more C. difficile (p < 0.001) but not C. 
perfringens (p = 0.09) compared to healthy horses. Prevalence in horses with 
diarrhea was 8% for both Clostridium species. There were no significant 
microbiota differences between C. difficile shedders and non-shedders with 
regards to relative abundance on any phylogenetic level, and alpha diversity. 
Limited differences were seen on LEfSE analysis and in beta diversity indices. 
Multiple fecal samples should be taken when investigating shedding of enteric 
clostridia. As horses with colic shed more enteric clostridia compared to 
healthy horses special biosecurity protocols for horses with colic should be 
considered in hospitals. Differences in microbiota composition between C. 
difficile shedders and non-shedders were limited. Further studies on the role of 
dysbiosis in C. difficile are needed.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the main cause of 
nosocomial antibiotic-associated colitis and increased incidence of 
community-associated diarrhea in industrialized countries. At present, the 
primary treatment of CDI is antibiotic administration, which is effective but 
often associated with recurrence, especially in the elderly. Pathogenic strains 
produce enterotoxin, toxin A (TcdA), and cytotoxin, toxin B (TcdB), which are 
necessary for C. difficile induced diarrhea and gut pathological changes. 
Administration of anti-toxin antibodies provides an alternative approach to 
treat CDI, and has shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. 
In the current study, several humanized anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB monoclonal 
antibodies were generated and their protective potency was characterized in a 
hamster infection model. The humanized anti-TcdA (CANmAbA4) and anti-TcdB 
(CANmAbB4 and CANmAbB1) antibodies showed broad spectrum in vitro neutralization 
of toxins from clinical strains and neutralization in a mouse toxin challenge 
model. Moreover, co-administration of humanized antibodies (CANmAbA4 and 
CANmAbB4 cocktail) provided a high level of protection in a dose dependent 
manner (85% versus 57% survival at day 22 for 50 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses, 
respectively) in a hamster gastrointestinal infection (GI) model. This study 
describes the protective effects conferred by novel neutralizing anti-toxin 
monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins and their potential as 
therapeutic agents in treating CDI.

OBJECTIVES: SMT19969 is a novel narrow-spectrum antimicrobial under development 
for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The objectives were 
to assess the relative efficacies of SMT19969, vancomycin and fidaxomicin in the 
hamster model of CDI.
METHODS: Hamsters were infected with either C. difficile BI1 (ribotype 027) or 
C. difficile 630 (ribotype 012) prior to treatment with vehicle, SMT19969, 
fidaxomicin or vancomycin for 5 days. Animals were further monitored through to 
day 28 and survival recorded. Plasma and gastrointestinal concentrations of 
SMT19969 following single and repeat administration in infected hamsters were 
determined.
RESULTS: Following infection with C. difficile BI1, treatment with SMT19969, 
vancomycin and fidaxomicin resulted in 100% survival during the 5 day dosing 
period, with 90%-100% of animals receiving SMT19969 and fidaxomicin surviving 
during the post-dosing follow-up period. Whilst protective during treatment, 
onset of mortality was observed on day 11 in animals treated with vancomycin, 
with a 10% survival recorded by day 28. Similar results were observed for 
SMT19969 and vancomycin following infection with C. difficile 630, with day 28 
survival rates of 80%-100% and 0%, respectively. Fidaxomicin protected animals 
infected with C. difficile 630 from mortality during dosing, although day 28 
survival rates varied from 0% to 40% depending on dose. Plasma levels of 
SMT19969 were typically below the limit of quantification, but levels in the 
gastrointestinal tract remained far in excess of the MIC.
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that SMT19969 is highly effective at treating both 
acute infection and preventing recurrent disease and support continued 
investigation of SMT19969 as a potential therapy for CDI.

New therapies are needed to prevent and treat Clostridium difficile infection 
and to limit the rise in antibiotic resistance. Besides toxins, several surface 
components have been characterized as colonization factors and have been shown 
as immunogenic. This review will focus on passive and active immunization 
strategies targeting C. difficile surface components to combat C. difficile. 
Concerning passive immunization, the first strategies used antisera raised 
against the entire bacterium to prevent infection in the hamster model. Then, 
surface components such as the flagellin and the S-layer proteins were used for 
immunization and the passive transfer of antibodies was protective in animal 
models. Passive immunotherapy with polyvalent immunoglobulins was used in humans 
and bovine immunoglobulin concentrates were evaluated in clinical trials. 
Concerning active immunization, vaccine assays targeting surface components were 
tested mainly in animal models, mouse models of colonization and hamster models 
of infection. Bacterial extracts, spore proteins and surface components of 
vegetative cells such as cell wall proteins, flagellar proteins, and 
polysaccharides were used as vaccine targets. Vaccine assays were performed by 
parenteral and mucosal routes of immunization. Both gave promising results and 
pave the way to development of new vaccines.

OBJECTIVES: REP3123 is a fully synthetic methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor in 
pre-clinical development as a novel agent to treat Clostridium difficile 
infection (CDI). This novel agent was investigated for its ability to block the 
production of toxins and spores, and was tested for efficacy in vivo in a 
hamster model.
METHODS: Clostridial toxin levels were determined qualitatively using monoclonal 
antibodies and by cytotoxicity assays. Spores were detected by staining and by 
quantitative dilution plating after ethanol treatment. Efficacy of REP3123 was 
tested in a clindamycin-induced C. difficile hamster gastrointestinal (GI) 
infection model.
RESULTS: REP3123 at concentrations as low as 1 mg/L inhibited de novo toxin 
production in high cell density, stationary phase cultures of C. difficile. 
Among comparator agents currently used for CDI therapy, vancomycin required much 
higher levels of 20 mg/L, and metronidazole had no effect on toxin levels. 
REP3123 caused a >10-fold reduction of the sporulation rate in vitro. Vancomycin 
and, in particular, metronidazole appeared to promote the formation of spores. 
REP3123, at concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/kg, demonstrated efficacy in the 
hamster model of CDI and was superior to vancomycin in the overall survival of 
the animals at the end of the study (33 days).
CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 inhibited growth of C. difficile, affected the production 
of toxins and spores and demonstrated superior efficacy compared with vancomycin 
in the hamster GI infection model. This agent may be a promising candidate for 
CDI treatment; in particular, the inhibition of toxin production and spore 
formation may reduce the severity and spread of the disease, respectively.
