PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize the current data 
available on the metabolic effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
including obesity and glucose metabolism in humans.
RECENT FINDINGS: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is a frequent characteristic observed 
in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Pieces of evidence mostly generated 
in mouse models suggest that rescuing this dysbiosis associates with improved 
metabolism. In humans, dietary or bariatric surgery interventions are often 
accompanied by complete or partial restoration of this dysbiosis together with 
weight reduction and metabolic amelioration. FMT is an interesting option to 
modify gut microbiota and has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, 
albeit only used in routine care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, 
there are only limited data on using FMT in the metabolic context. FMT from lean 
donors significantly improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with 
metabolic syndrome. However, there is a wide range of clinical responses. 
Interestingly in subjects with high microbial gene richness at baseline and when 
FMT donors that are metabolically compromised are used, no metabolic improvement 
is seen. Moreover, more studies evaluating the effect of FMT in patients with 
overt type 2 diabetes are warranted. Furthermore, interventions (in the receiver 
prior to FMT) aiming to enhance FMT response also need evaluation.

This report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, 
treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and 
cats, with an emphasis on Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, 
Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli associated with 
granulomatous colitis in Boxers. Veterinarians are challenged when attempting to 
diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because 
well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for 
implementing fecal testing are lacking. This problem is compounded by similar 
isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and 
without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic 
laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. Most bacterial 
enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious 
administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. 
Salmonella and Campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial 
administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive 
therapy is recommended. Basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate 
protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of 
control. Handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based 
hand sanitizers because spores of C. difficile and C. perfringens are 
alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular 
household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. The implementation of 
practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated 
molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to 
optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs 
and cats.

Clostridium difficile is currently the leading cause of nosocomial infection. 
Antibiotics remain the first-line therapy for C. difficile-associated diseases 
(CDAD), despite the risks of resistance promotion and further gut microbiota 
perturbation. Notably, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was reported to be 
significantly decreased in CDAD patients. This study aimed to clarify the 
prophylactic effects of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in a mouse model of C. 
difficile infection (CDI). The CDI mouse model was successfully created using C. 
difficile strain VPI 10463 spores, as confirmed by lethal diarrhea (12.5% 
survival rate), serious gut barrier disruption, and microbiota disruption. CDI 
model mice prophylactically treated with B. fragilis exhibited significantly 
higher survival rates (100% in low dosage group, 87.5% in high dosage group) and 
improved clinical manifestations. Histopathological analysis of colon and cecum 
tissue samples revealed an intact gut barrier with strong ZO-1 and Muc-2 
expression. The bacterial diversity and relative abundance of gut microbiota 
were significantly improved. Interestingly, the relative abundance of 
Akkermansia muciniphila was positively correlated with B. fragilis treatment. In 
vitro experiments showed that B. fragilis inhibited C. difficile adherence, and 
attenuated the decrease in CDI-induced transepithelial electrical resistance, 
ZO-1 and MUC-2 loss, and apoptosis, suggesting that B. fragilis protected 
against CDI possibly by resisting pathogen colonization and improving gut 
barrier integrity and functions. In summary, B. fragilis exerted protective 
effects on a CDI mouse model by modulating gut microbiota and alleviating 
barrier destruction, thereby relieving epithelial stress and pathogenic colitis 
triggered by C. difficile. This study provides an alternative preventative 
measure for CDI and lays the foundations for further investigations of the 
relationships among opportunistic pathogens, commensal microbiota, and the gut 
barrier.

A multitude of diverse microorganisms, termed the microbiota, reside in the gut, 
respiratory tract, skin, and genital tract of humans and other animals. Recent 
advances in metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics have enabled detailed 
characterization of these vital microbial communities. Studies in animal models 
have uncovered vital previously unrecognized roles for the microbiota in normal 
function of the immune responses, and when perturbed, in the pathogenesis of 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, but also at distant sites in 
the body including the brain. The composition of gut and respiratory microbiota 
can influence systemic inflammatory responses that mediate asthma, allergy, 
inflammatory bowel disease, obesity-related diseases, and neurodevelopmental or 
neurodegenerative conditions. Experiments in mouse models as well as emerging 
clinical studies have revealed that therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota, 
using fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, or engineered probiotics 
represent effective nontoxic approaches for the treatment or prevention of 
Clostridium difficile infection, allergy, and autoimmune diseases and may 
enhance the efficacy of certain cancer immunotherapeutics. This review discusses 
how commensal bacteria can influence immune responses that mediate a range of 
human diseases and how the microbiota are being targeted to treat these 
diseases, especially those resistant to pharmacological therapies.

The gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are colonized by hundreds of microbial 
species that contribute to health, including colonization resistance against 
intestinal pathogens. Many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities 
and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Among these, Clostridium 
difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases 
morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Which intestinal bacteria 
provide resistance to C. difficile infection and their in vivo inhibitory 
mechanisms remain unclear. Here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa 
with development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that 
result in distinct microbiota changes and lead to varied susceptibility to C. 
difficile. Mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the microbiota of 
hospitalized patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice 
and humans. Using these platforms, we determine that Clostridium scindens, a 
bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance 
to C. difficile infection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to 
infection in a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. Using a workflow involving 
mouse models, clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical 
modelling, we identify a probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant 
microbiome deficiency. These findings have implications for the rational design 
of targeted antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and 
therapeutics for individuals at risk of C. difficile infection.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and 
characteristics of Clostridium difficile shedding in owned dogs in Nigeria and 
Malawi. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 31/120 (26%) dogs in Nigeria and 
11/92 (12%) dogs in Malawi (p = 0.012). Overall, 22/42 (52%) isolates were 
toxigenic; 17/31 (55%) from Nigeria and 5/11 (45%) from Malawi. All toxigenic 
isolates possessing tcdA and tcdB, and only one also possessed cdtA/B. Sixteen 
different ribotypes were found, ten (63%) of which were non-toxigenic. Most 
isolates corresponded to ribotypes that have been previously identified in 
humans or livestock. The role of dogs in transmission of C. difficile and the 
clinical implications of C. difficile shedding in dogs remain unclear. These 
data indicate that dogs could act as a source of C. difficile for exposure of 
other species, including humans; however, the true risk is unknown. Further 
study of the ecology of C. difficile and the role of dogs in disease of humans 
and other domestic animals is indicated.

Antibiotics can have significant and long-lasting effects on the 
gastrointestinal tract microbiota, reducing colonization resistance against 
pathogens including Clostridium difficile. Here we show that antibiotic 
treatment induces substantial changes in the gut microbial community and in the 
metabolome of mice susceptible to C. difficile infection. Levels of secondary 
bile acids, glucose, free fatty acids and dipeptides decrease, whereas those of 
primary bile acids and sugar alcohols increase, reflecting the modified 
metabolic activity of the altered gut microbiome. In vitro and ex vivo analyses 
demonstrate that C. difficile can exploit specific metabolites that become more 
abundant in the mouse gut after antibiotics, including the primary bile acid 
taurocholate for germination, and carbon sources such as mannitol, fructose, 
sorbitol, raffinose and stachyose for growth. Our results indicate that 
antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome converts the global 
metabolic profile to one that favours C. difficile germination and growth.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infection with Clostridium difficile causes nosocomial 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Hamsters historically have been used 
to investigate disease pathogenesis and treatment, but are not ideal models 
because of the lack of hamster-specific reagents and genetically modified 
animals, and because they develop fulminant disease. The aim of this study was 
to establish a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile-associated disease 
(CDAD) that more closely resembles human disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a mixture of antibiotics (kanamycin, 
gentamicin, colistin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) for 3 days. Two days later, 
they were given injections of clindamycin and then challenged 1 day later with 
different doses of C. difficile.
RESULTS: Mice that were exposed to antibiotics and then challenged with C. 
difficile developed diarrhea and lost weight. Disease severity varied from 
fulminant to minimal in accordance with the challenge dose. Typical histologic 
features of CDAD were evident. Oral vancomycin prevented CDAD in all mice, but 
68% died from colitis after treatment was discontinued. All animals that 
survived an initial episode of CDAD showed no evidence of diarrhea or colitis 
after subsequent rechallenge with C. difficile. Different strains of C. 
difficile tested in the model showed different levels of virulence in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a mouse model of CDAD that closely represents the 
human disease. In light of the recent substantial increases in CDAD incidence 
and severity, this model will be valuable in testing new treatments, examining 
disease pathogenesis, and elucidating mechanisms of protective immunity.

Clostridium difficile disease has recently increased to become a dominant 
nosocomial pathogen in North America and Europe, although little is known about 
what has driven this emergence. Here we show that two epidemic ribotypes (RT027 
and RT078) have acquired unique mechanisms to metabolize low concentrations of 
the disaccharide trehalose. RT027 strains contain a single point mutation in the 
trehalose repressor that increases the sensitivity of this ribotype to trehalose 
by more than 500-fold. Furthermore, dietary trehalose increases the virulence of 
a RT027 strain in a mouse model of infection. RT078 strains acquired a cluster 
of four genes involved in trehalose metabolism, including a PTS permease that is 
both necessary and sufficient for growth on low concentrations of trehalose. We 
propose that the implementation of trehalose as a food additive into the human 
diet, shortly before the emergence of these two epidemic lineages, helped select 
for their emergence and contributed to hypervirulence.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is a leading cause of 
healthcare-associated infections. Although considerable progress has been made 
in the understanding of its genome, the epigenome of C. difficile and its 
functional impact has not been systematically explored. Here, we perform a 
comprehensive DNA methylome analysis of C. difficile using 36 human isolates and 
observe a high level of epigenomic diversity. We discovered an orphan DNA 
methyltransferase with a well-defined specificity, the corresponding gene of 
which is highly conserved across our dataset and in all of the approximately 300 
global C. difficile genomes examined. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene 
negatively impacts sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, 
and these results are consistently supported by multiomics data, genetic 
experiments and a mouse colonization model. Further experimental and 
transcriptomic analyses suggest that epigenetic regulation is associated with 
cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization. These findings provide a 
unique epigenetic dimension to characterize medically relevant biological 
processes in this important pathogen. This study also provides a set of methods 
for comparative epigenomics and integrative analysis, which we expect to be 
broadly applicable to bacterial epigenomic studies.

With wild rodents and insectivores being present around humans and their living, 
working and food production environments, it is important to gain knowledge of 
the zoonotic pathogens present in these animals. The enteropathogen Clostridium 
difficile, an opportunistic anaerobic bacteria, can be carried by both animals 
and humans, and is distributed globally. It is known that there is genetic 
overlap between human and animal sources of C. difficile. In this study, the aim 
was to assess the presence of C. difficile in rodents and insectivores trapped 
on and around pig and cattle farms in the Netherlands. In total 347 rodents and 
insectivores (10 different species) were trapped and 39·2% tested positive for 
presence of C. difficile. For all positive samples the ribotype (RT) was 
determined, and in total there were 13 different RTs found (in descending order 
of frequency: 057, 010, 029, 005, 073, 078, 015, 035, 454, 014, 058, 062, 087). 
Six of the RTs isolated from rodents and insectivores are known to be associated 
with human C. difficile infection; RT005, RT010, RT014, RT015, RT078 and RT087. 
The presence of rodents and insectivores in and around food production buildings 
(e.g. farms) could contribute to the spread of C. difficile in the human 
environment. In order to enable on-farm management for pathogen control, it is 
essential to comprehend the role of wild rodents and insectivores that could 
potentially affect the ecology of disease agents on farms. SIGNIFICANCE AND 
IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that rodents and insectivores in and 
around food production buildings (e.g. farms) can carry Clostridium difficile 
ribotypes associated with human C. difficile infection (CDI). C. difficile 
spores in rodent and insectivore droppings are able to survive in the 
environment for prolonged periods, leading to host-to-host exposure and 
transmission. Therefore we can state that rodent and insectivore presence on 
farms is a risk for zoonotic pathogen transmission of C. difficile.

Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) is a major exotoxin contributing to 
disruption of the colonic epithelium during C. difficile infection. TcdA 
contains a carbohydrate-binding combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain 
that mediates its attachment to cell surfaces, but recent data suggest the 
existence of CROPs-independent receptors. Here, we carried out genome-wide 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated screens using a truncated 
TcdA lacking the CROPs, and identified sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) and 
low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as host factors contributing to binding 
and entry of TcdA. TcdA recognizes the sulfation group in sGAGs. Blocking 
sulfation and glycosaminoglycan synthesis reduces TcdA binding and entry into 
cells. Binding of TcdA to the colonic epithelium can be reduced by surfen, a 
small molecule that masks sGAGs, by GM-1111, a sulfated heparan sulfate 
analogue, and by sulfated cyclodextrin, a sulfated small molecule. Cells lacking 
LDLR also show reduced sensitivity to TcdA, although binding between LDLR and 
TcdA are not detected, suggesting that LDLR may facilitate endocytosis of TcdA. 
Finally, GM-1111 reduces TcdA-induced fluid accumulation and tissue damage in 
the colon in a mouse model in which TcdA is injected into the caecum. These data 
demonstrate in vivo and pathological relevance of TcdA-sGAGs interactions, and 
reveal a potential therapeutic approach of protecting colonic tissues by 
blocking these interactions.

The aim of this study was to investigate Clostridium difficile and Clostridium 
perfringens in 82 diarrheic dogs positive for canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV). 
Enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A was isolated from three (3.6%) dogs. One 
(1.2%) strain was also positive for NetE- and NetF-encoding genes, which are 
commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs. Toxigenic C. difficile was isolated 
from one animal (1.2%), which was also positive for A/B toxins. The present 
study identified C. difficile and C. perfringens infection in CPV-positive dogs. 
Further studies are necessary to clarify if clostridial infections may 
predispose or potentiate CPV-infection in dogs or vice versa.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore former, and an 
important nosocomial pathogenic bacterium. C. difficile spores are the 
morphotype of transmission and recurrence of the disease. The formation of 
C. difficile spores and their subsequent germination are essential processes 
during the infection. Recent in vitro and in vivo work has shed light on how 
spores are formed and the timing of in vivo sporulation in a mouse model. 
Advances have also been made in our understanding of the machineries involved in 
spore germination, and how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis affects the metabolism 
of bile salts and thus impacts C. difficile germination in vivo. Studies have 
also attempted to identify how C. difficile spores interact with the host's 
intestinal mucosa. Spore resistance has also been revisited by several groups 
highlighting the extreme resistance of this morphotype to traditional food 
processing regimes and disinfectants used in clinical settings. Therefore, the 
aim of this review is to summarize recent advances on spore 
formation/germination in vitro and in vivo, spore-host interactions, and spore 
resistance that contribute to our knowledge of the role of C. difficile spores 
in the infectious process.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is recognised as an emerging 
disease in both humans and some animal species. During the past few years, 
insights into human CDI epidemiology changed and C. difficile is also considered 
as an emerging community-acquired pathogen. Certain ribotypes (RT) are possibly 
associated with zoonotic transmission. The objective of this study was to assess 
the presence of C. difficile in a population of pets and to characterise the 
isolates.
RESULTS: Faecal samples from a total of 90 diarrhoeic dogs and 24 from exotic 
animal species (both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic) were analysed. Clostridium 
difficile was isolated from 6 (6.7%) dogs and one reptile sample (4.2%). Four 
(66.7%) of the six dog strains were capable of producing toxins. Four known 
different RTs were detected in dogs (010, 014, 123 and 358) and a new one was 
found in a faecal sample of an exotic animal. This new RT isolate was negative 
for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347 which has been 
proposed as a Clade-III member. Importantly, two dog strains showed a stable 
resistance to metronidazole (initial MIC values: 128 and 48 μg/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implementation of 
antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of 
metronidazole resistance in dogs; molecular studies to elucidate C. difficile 
metronidazole resistance mechanisms are warranted. Based on the similarity 
between the ribotypes observed in dogs and those described in humans, the 
zoonotic transmission should be further explored. Furthermore, exotic animals 
have shown to harbor uncommon C. difficile strains which require further genomic 
studies.

Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is a key predisposing factor for Clostridium 
difficile infections (CDIs), which cause intestinal disease ranging from mild 
diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. Here, we examined the impact of a 
microbiota-derived metabolite, short-chain fatty acid acetate, on an acute mouse 
model of CDI. We found that administration of acetate is remarkably beneficial 
in ameliorating disease. Mechanistically, we show that acetate enhances innate 
immune responses by acting on both neutrophils and ILC3s through its cognate 
receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2). In neutrophils, acetate-FFAR2 
signaling accelerates their recruitment to the inflammatory sites, facilitates 
inflammasome activation, and promotes the release of IL-1β; in ILC3s, 
acetate-FFAR2 augments expression of the IL-1 receptor, which boosts IL-22 
secretion in response to IL-1β. We conclude that microbiota-derived acetate 
promotes host innate responses to C. difficile through coordinate action on 
neutrophils and ILC3s.

Potential relevance of pig gut content transplantation for production and 
research.

It is becoming increasingly evident that the gastrointestinal microbiota has a 
significant impact on the overall health and production of the pig. This has led 
to intensified research on the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, 
factors affecting it, and the impact of the microbiota on health, growth 
performance, and more recently, behavior of the host. Swine production research 
has been heavily focused on assessing the effects of feed additives and dietary 
modifications to alter or take advantage of select characteristics of 
gastrointestinal microbes to improve health and feed conversion efficiency. 
Research on faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a possible tool to 
improve outcomes in pigs through manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome 
is very recent and limited data is available. Results on FMT in humans 
demonstrating the transfer of phenotypic traits from donors to recipients and 
the high efficacy of FMT to treat Clostridium difficile infections in humans, 
together with data from pigs relating GI-tract microbiota composition with 
growth performance has likely played an important role in the interest towards 
this strategy in pig production. However, several factors can influence the 
impact of FMT on the recipient, and these need to be identified and optimized 
before this tool can be applied to pig production. There are obvious inherent 
biosecurity and regulatory issues in this strategy, since the donor's microbiome 
can never be completely screened for all possible non-desirable microorganisms. 
However, considering the success observed in humans, it seems worth 
investigating this strategy for certain applications in pig production. Further, 
FMT research may lead to the identification of specific bacterial group(s) 
essential for a particular outcome, resulting in the development of banks of 
clones which can be used as targeted therapeutics, rather than the broader 
approach applied in FMT. This review examines the factors associated with the 
use of FMT, and its potential application to swine production, and includes 
research on using the pig as model for human medical purposes.

Clostridium difficile is a well-documented cause of enterocolitis in several 
species, including humans, with limited documentation in New World nonhuman 
primates. We report several cases of C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous 
enterocolitis, including a case in a Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) 
and several cases in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The histologic 
lesions included a spectrum of severity, with most cases characterized by the 
classic "volcano" lesions described in humans and several other animal species. 
C. difficile was isolated from the colon of the spider monkey, while the 
presence of toxin A or toxin B or of the genes of toxin A or B by polymerase 
chain reaction served as corroborative evidence in several affected marmosets. 
C. difficile should be considered a cause of enterocolitis in these species.

To identify factors that regulate gut microbiota density and the impact of 
varied microbiota density on health, we assayed this fundamental ecosystem 
property in fecal samples across mammals, human disease, and therapeutic 
interventions. Physiologic features of the host (carrying capacity) and the 
fitness of the gut microbiota shape microbiota density. Therapeutic manipulation 
of microbiota density in mice altered host metabolic and immune homeostasis. In 
humans, gut microbiota density was reduced in Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The gut microbiota in recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection had lower density and reduced fitness that were 
restored by fecal microbiota transplantation. Understanding the interplay 
between microbiota and disease in terms of microbiota density, host carrying 
capacity, and microbiota fitness provide new insights into microbiome structure 
and microbiome targeted therapeutics.

The presence and genetic diversity of Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens 
along the slaughtering process of pigs reared in a free-range system was 
assessed. A total of 270 samples from trucks, lairage, slaughter line and 
quartering were analyzed, and recovered isolates were toxinotyped and genotyped. 
C. difficile and C. perfringens were retrieved from 14.4% and 12.6% of samples, 
respectively. The highest percentage of positive samples for C. difficile was 
detected in trucks (80%) whereas C. perfringens was more prevalent in cecal and 
colonic samples obtained in the slaughter line (85% and 45%, respectively). C. 
difficile isolates (n = 105) were classified into 17 PCR ribotypes (including 
010, 078, and 126) and 95 AFLP genotypes. C. perfringens isolates (n = 85) 
belonged to toxinotypes A (94.1%) and C (5.9%) and were classified into 80 AFLP 
genotypes. The same genotypes of C. difficile and C. perfringens were isolated 
from different pigs and occasionally from environmental samples, suggesting a 
risk of contaminated meat products.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a main cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in humans. Several studies have been performed 
to reveal the prevalence rate of C. difficile in cats and dogs. However, little 
is known about the epidemiology of C. difficile in healthy pets in China. This 
study aimed to assess the burden of C. difficile shedding by healthy dogs and 
cats in China. Furthermore, the genetic diversity and antimicrobial 
susceptibility patterns of the recovered isolates were determined.
METHODS: A total of 175 faecal samples were collected from 146 healthy dogs and 
29 cats. C. difficile strains were isolated and identified from the feces of 
these pets. The characterized C. difficile strains were typed by multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST), and the MICs of the isolates were determined against 
ampicillin, clindamycin, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, 
metronidazole and vancomycin by the agar dilution method.
RESULTS: Overall, 3 faecal samples (1.7%) were C. difficile culture positive. 
One sample (0.7%) from a dog was C. difficile culture positive, while two cats 
(7.0%) yielded positive cultures. The prevalence rate differed significantly 
between cats and dogs. These isolates were typed into 3 MLST genotypes and were 
susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, metronidazole and moxifloxacin and 
resistant to ampicillin, clindamycin and cefoxitin. Notably, one strain, D141-1, 
which was resistant to three kinds of antibiotics and carried toxin genes, was 
recovered in the faeces of a healthy dog.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that common pets may be a source of pathogenic 
C. difficile, indicating that household transmission of C. difficile from pets 
to humans can not be excluded.

Bacteriology and Food Safety, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P,O, 
Box 7028, Uppsala, SE-750 07, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the faecal occurrence and 
characterization of Clostridium difficile in clinically healthy dogs (N = 50) 
and in dogs with diarrhea (N = 20) in the Stockholm-Uppsala region of Sweden.
FINDINGS: Clostridium difficile was isolated from 2/50 healthy dogs and from 
2/20 diarrheic dogs. Isolates from healthy dogs were negative for toxin A and B 
and for the tcdA and tcdB genes. Both isolates from diarrheic dogs were positive 
for toxin B and for the tcdA and tcdB genes. The C. difficile isolates from 
healthy dogs had PCR ribotype 009 (SE-type 6) and 010 (SE-type 3) whereas both 
isolates from dogs with diarrhoea had the toxigenic ribotype 014 (SE-type 21). 
One of the isolates from healthy dogs was initially resistant to metronidazole.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed presence of toxigenic C. difficile in faecal 
samples of diarrheic dogs and low number of non- toxigenic isolates in healthy 
dogs from Uppsala-Stockholm region in Sweden. However, more comprehensive 
studies are warranted to investigate the role of C. difficile in 
gastrointestinal disease in dogs.

Zoonotic transmission of Clostridium difficile has been largely hypothesised to 
occur after direct or indirect contact with contaminated animal faeces. Recent 
studies have reported the presence of the bacterium in the natural environment, 
including in soils and rivers. If C. difficile spores are scattered in the 
environment, they can easily enter the respiratory tract of dogs, and therefore, 
dog nasal discharge could be a direct route of transmission not previously 
investigated. This study reports for the first time the presence of C. difficile 
in the respiratory tracts of dogs. The bacterium was isolated from 6 (17.1%) out 
of 35 nasal samples, with a total of 4 positive dogs (19%). C. difficile was 
recovered from both proximal and distal nasal cavities. All isolates were 
toxigenic and belonged to PCR-ribotype 014, which is one of the most predominant 
types in animals and in community-acquired C. difficile infections in recent 
years. The findings of this study demonstrate that the nasal cavity of dogs is 
contaminated with toxigenic C. difficile, and therefore, its secretions could be 
considered as a new route by which bacteria are spread and transmitted.

Christchurch Science Centre, Christchurch, New Zealand.

The objective of this study was to undertake a microbiological survey of foods, 
animal faeces and wastewater samples for Clostridium difficile, and determine 
the genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolates. A total of 211 
samples were tested for C. difficile using culture methods. Thirteen toxigenic 
C. difficile isolates were obtained; ten from wastewater samples, one each from 
pig and duck faeces and another from a raw meat product. Eight PCR-ribotypes 
(RTs) were identified, including two novel RTs (878 and 879). Single-nucleotide 
polymorphism analysis using WGS data for all isolates provided greater 
discrimination between C. difficile isolates within the same RT and multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST) profiles. All C. difficile isolates were found to be 
susceptible to the first-line human antimicrobials used to treat C. difficile 
infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to 
report the isolation of Clostridium difficile from animals, food and wastewater 
in New Zealand (NZ) and provides important data with respect to ribotypes and 
multilocus sequence typing profiles, whole genome sequence and antimicrobial 
susceptibilities. The results highlight the need for further investigations into 
the epidemiology of C. difficile in NZ and to elucidate the role of the 
environmental and food sources as transmission routes of human infection.

Gut fungi may influence the course of Clostridium difficile infection either 
positively or negatively for the host. Fungi are not prominent in the mouse gut, 
and C. albicans, the major human gastrointestinal commensal yeast, is in low 
abundance or absent in mice. Bifidobacterium is one of the probiotics that may 
attenuate the severity of C. difficile infection. Inflammatory synergy between 
C. albicans and C. difficile, in gut, may provide a state that more closely 
resembles human infection and be more suitable for testing probiotic effects. We 
performed fecal mycobiota analysis and administered C. albicans at 1 day prior 
to C. difficile dosing. Fecal eukaryotic 18S rDNA analysis demonstrated the 
presence of Ascomycota, specifically, Candida spp., after oral antibiotics, 
despite negative fecal fungal culture. C. albicans administration enhanced the 
severity of the C. difficile infection model as determined by mortality rate, 
weight loss, gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay), and serum and intestinal tissue 
cytokines. This occurred without increased fecal C. difficile or bacteremia, in 
comparison with C. difficile gavage alone. Candida lysate with C. difficile 
increased IL-8 production from HT-29 and Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial 
cell-lines. Bifidobacterium attenuated the disease severity of the C. difficile 
plus Candida model. The reduced severity was associated with decreased Candida 
burdens in feces. In conclusion, gut C. albicans worsened C. difficile 
infection, possibly through exacerbation of inflammation. Hence, a mouse model 
of Clostridium difficile infection with C. albicans present in the gut may 
better model the human patient condition. Gut fungal mycobiome investigation in 
patients with C. difficile is warranted and may suggest therapeutic targets.

Thing?

Clostridioides (formerly known as Clostridium) difficile is the leading cause of 
hospital-acquired gastrointestinal infections in the United States and one of 
three urgent health care threats identified by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. C. difficile disease is mediated by the production of toxins 
that disrupt the epithelial barrier and cause a robust host inflammatory 
response. Studies in humans as well as animal models of disease have shown that 
the type of immune response generated against the infection dictates the outcome 
of disease, often irrespective of bacterial burden. Much of the focus on 
immunity during C. difficile infection (CDI) has been on type 3 immunity because 
of the established role for this arm of the immune system in other 
gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). For example, interleukin-22 (IL-22) production by group 3 innate lymphoid 
cells (ILC3s) protects against pathobionts translocating across the epithelium 
during CDI. On the other hand, interleukin-17 (IL-17) production by Th17 cells 
increases CDI-associated mortality. Additionally, neutropenia has been 
associated with increased susceptibility to CDI in humans, but increased 
neutrophilia in mouse models correlates with host pathology. Taking the data 
together, these findings suggest dual roles for type 3 immune responses during 
infection. Here, we review the complex role of type 3 immunity during CDI and 
delineate what is known about innate and adaptive cellular immunity as well as 
the downstream effector cytokines known to be important during this infection.

Shifts in the Gut Metabolome and Clostridium difficile Transcriptome throughout 
Colonization and Infection in a Mouse Model.

Antibiotics alter the gut microbiota and decrease resistance to Clostridium 
difficile colonization; however, the mechanisms driving colonization resistance 
are not well understood. Loss of resistance to C. difficile colonization due to 
antibiotic treatment is associated with alterations in the gut metabolome, 
specifically, with increases in levels of nutrients that C. difficile can 
utilize for growth in vitro. To define the nutrients that C. difficile requires 
for colonization and pathogenesis in vivo, we used a combination of mass 
spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) to model the gut metabolome and 
C. difficile transcriptome throughout an acute infection in a mouse model at the 
following time points: 0, 12, 24, and 30 h. We also performed multivariate-based 
integration of the omics data to define the signatures that were most important 
throughout colonization and infection. Here we show that amino acids, in 
particular, proline and branched-chain amino acids, and carbohydrates decrease 
in abundance over time in the mouse cecum and that C. difficile gene expression 
is consistent with their utilization in vivo. This was also reinforced by the 
multivariate-based integration of the omics data where we were able to 
discriminate the metabolites and transcripts that support C. difficile 
physiology between the different time points throughout colonization and 
infection. This report illustrates how important the availability of amino acids 
and other nutrients is for the initial stages of C. difficile colonization and 
progression of disease. Future studies identifying the source of the nutrients 
and engineering bacteria capable of outcompeting C. difficile in the gut will be 
important for developing new targeted bacterial therapeutics. IMPORTANCE 
Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen of global significance that is a 
major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Antibiotics deplete the 
indigenous gut microbiota and change the metabolic environment in the gut to one 
favoring C. difficile growth. Here we used metabolomics and transcriptomics to 
define the gut environment after antibiotics and during the initial stages of 
C. difficile colonization and infection. We show that amino acids, in 
particular, proline and branched-chain amino acids, and carbohydrates decrease 
in abundance over time and that C. difficile gene expression is consistent with 
their utilization by the bacterium in vivo. We employed an integrated approach 
to analyze the metabolome and transcriptome to identify associations between 
metabolites and transcripts. This highlighted the importance of key nutrients in 
the early stages of colonization, and the data provide a rationale for the 
development of therapies based on the use of bacteria that specifically compete 
for nutrients that are essential for C. difficile colonization and disease.

New therapies are needed to prevent and treat Clostridium difficile infection 
and to limit the rise in antibiotic resistance. Besides toxins, several surface 
components have been characterized as colonization factors and have been shown 
as immunogenic. This review will focus on passive and active immunization 
strategies targeting C. difficile surface components to combat C. difficile. 
Concerning passive immunization, the first strategies used antisera raised 
against the entire bacterium to prevent infection in the hamster model. Then, 
surface components such as the flagellin and the S-layer proteins were used for 
immunization and the passive transfer of antibodies was protective in animal 
models. Passive immunotherapy with polyvalent immunoglobulins was used in humans 
and bovine immunoglobulin concentrates were evaluated in clinical trials. 
Concerning active immunization, vaccine assays targeting surface components were 
tested mainly in animal models, mouse models of colonization and hamster models 
of infection. Bacterial extracts, spore proteins and surface components of 
vegetative cells such as cell wall proteins, flagellar proteins, and 
polysaccharides were used as vaccine targets. Vaccine assays were performed by 
parenteral and mucosal routes of immunization. Both gave promising results and 
pave the way to development of new vaccines.

Clostridiodes (Clostridium) difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive, 
spore-forming nosocomial, gastrointestinal pathogen causing C. 
difficile-associated disease with symptoms ranging from mild cases of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea to fatal pseudomembranous colitis. We developed 
murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for a conserved cell surface 
antigen, lipoteichoic acid (LTA)of C. difficile. The mAbs were characterized in 
terms of their thermal stability, solubility, and their binding to LTA by 
surface plasmon resonance and competitive ELISA. Synthetic LTA molecules were 
prepared in order to better define the minimum epitope required to mimic the 
natural antigen, and three repeat units of the polymer were required for optimal 
recognition. One of the murine mAbs was chimerized with human constant region 
domains and was found to recognize the target antigen identically to the mouse 
version. These mAbs may be useful as therapeutics (standalone, in conjunction 
with known antitoxin approaches, or as delivery vehicles for antibody drug 
conjugates targeting the bacterium), as diagnostic agents, and in infection 
control applications.

Pyroptosis is an inflammasome-induced lytic cell death mode, the physiological 
role of which in chronic inflammatory diseases is unknown. Familial 
Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease 
worldwide, affecting an estimated 150,000 patients. The disease is caused by 
missense mutations in Mefv that activate the Pyrin inflammasome, but the 
pathophysiologic mechanisms driving autoinflammation in FMF are incompletely 
understood. Here, we show that Clostridium difficile infection of FMF knock-in 
macrophages that express a chimeric FMF-associated MefvV726A Pyrin elicited 
pyroptosis and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. 
Importantly, in vivo GSDMD deletion abolished spontaneous autoinflammatory 
disease. GSDMD-deficient FMF knock-in mice were fully protected from the runted 
growth, anemia, systemic inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophilia, and 
tissue damage that characterize this autoinflammatory disease model. Overall, 
this work identifies pyroptosis as a critical mechanism of IL-1β-dependent 
autoinflammation in FMF and highlights GSDMD inhibition as a potential 
antiinflammatory strategy in inflammasome-driven diseases.

The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of Clostridioides (previously 
Clostridium) difficile and Clostridium perfringens in the feces of diarrheic and 
non-diarrheic dogs. Also, the presence of other common canine enteropathogens 
was examined. Toxigenic C. difficile and C. perfringens positive for the 
NetF-encoding gene (netF) were detected in 11 (11.9%) and seven (7.6%) diarrheic 
dogs, respectively. Three dogs were diagnosed simultaneously with toxigenic 
C. difficile and netF-positive C. perfringens. Among other enteropathogens, 
Giardia sp. was the most common agent detected in dogs positive for toxigenic 
C. difficile or netF-positive C. perfringens. The results suggest that 
C. difficile and C. perfringens occur more frequently as a primary cause of 
diarrhea.

OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficile is a toxin-producing bacterium and a leading 
cause of antibiotic-associated disease. The ability of C. difficile to form 
spores and infect antibiotic-treated persons at low multiplicity of infection 
(MOI) underlies its large disease burden. However, C. difficile-induced disease 
might also result from long-harboured C. difficile that blooms in individuals 
administered antibiotics.
DESIGN: Mice purchased from multiple vendors and repeatedly testing negative for 
this pathogen by quantitative PCR bloomed C. difficile following antibiotic 
treatment. This endogenous C. difficile strain, herein termed LEM1, which formed 
spores and produced toxin, was compared with highly pathogenic C. difficile 
strain VPI10463.
RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing revealed that LEM1 and VPI10463 shared 95% of 
their genes, including all known virulence genes. In contrast to VPI10463, LEM1 
did not induce overt disease when administered to antibiotic-treated or 
germ-free mice, even at high doses. Rather, blooms of LEM1 correlated with 
survival following VPI10463 inoculation, and exogenous administration of LEM1 
before or shortly following VPI10463 inoculation prevented C. difficile-induced 
death. Accordingly, despite similar growth properties in vitro, LEM1 strongly 
outcompeted VPI10463 in mice even at 100-fold lower inocula.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the difficulty of determining whether 
individual cases of C. difficile infection resulted from a bloom of endogenous 
C. difficile or a new exposure to this pathogen. In addition to impacting the 
design of studies using mouse models of C. difficile-induced disease, this study 
identified, isolated and characterised an endogenous murine spore-forming C. 
difficile strain able to decrease colonisation, associated disease and death 
induced by a pathogenic C. difficile strain.

One hundred and seventeen faecal samples from pet dogs (pup = 21 and adult = 96) 
brought for treatment to a veterinary clinic were examined for Clostridium 
difficile. A total of 16 (13.67%) samples were positive. Nine (56.25%) isolates 
were obtained from 17 adult dogs undergoing antibiotic treatment and this was 
significantly higher (p < 0.01) as compared to isolates from dogs without 
antibiotic treatment. Ten isolates (62.5%) were toxigenic (all toxinotype 0) and 
six were non-toxigenic. None of the isolates were positive for binary toxin 
genes. PCR ribotyping revealed three different ribotypes (012, 014 and 046) 
among A(+)B(+) isolates and five different ribotypes (010, SLO 131, and ACD 001 
to ACD 003) among A(-)B(-) isolates. The PFGE analysis of toxigenic isolates 
revealed three different pulsotypes corresponding to the PCR ribotypes.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in humans range from 
asymptomatic carriage to life-threatening intestinal disease. Findings on C. 
difficile in various animal species and an overlap in ribotypes (RTs) suggest 
potential zoonotic transmission. However, the impact of animals for human CDI 
remains unclear.
METHODS: In a large-scale survey we collected 1,447 fecal samples to determine 
the occurrence of C. difficile in small companion animals (dogs and cats) and 
their owners and to assess potential epidemiological links within the community. 
The Germany-wide survey was conducted from July 2012-August 2013. PCR 
ribotyping, Multilocus VNTR Analysis (MLVA) and PCR detection of toxin genes 
were used to characterize isolated C. difficile strains. A database was defined 
and logistic regression used to identify putative factors associated with fecal 
shedding of C. difficile.
RESULTS: In total, 1,418 samples met the inclusion criteria. The isolation rates 
for small companion animals and their owners within the community were similarly 
low with 3.0% (25/840) and 2.9% (17/578), respectively. PCR ribotyping revealed 
eight and twelve different RTs in animals and humans, respectively, whereas 
three RTs were isolated in both, humans and animals. RT 014/0, a well-known 
human hospital-associated lineage, was predominantly detected in animal samples. 
Moreover, the potentially highly pathogenic RTs 027 and 078 were isolated from 
dogs. Even though, C. difficile did not occur simultaneously in animals and 
humans sharing the same household. The results of the epidemiological analysis 
of factors associated with fecal shedding of C. difficile support the hypothesis 
of a zoonotic potential.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular characterization and epidemiological analysis revealed 
that the zoonotic risk for C. difficile associated with dogs and cats within the 
community is low but cannot be excluded.

Probiotics may represent a promising approach for reducing Clostridioides 
(Clostridium) difficile infections (CDIs). A clinical trial conducted by our 
group demonstrated that CDI patients undergoing adjunctive treatment with 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium probiotics had a reduction in diarrheal 
duration and compositional changes in their stool microbiomes. Here, we modified 
a CDI mouse model to represent clinical outcomes observed in patients and 
employed this model to identify evidence for the prevention of primary CDI and 
relapse with the same probiotic. Mice (n = 80) were administered 0.25 mg/ml 
cefoperazone over 5 days and subsequently challenged with 102 C. difficile VPI 
10463 spores. A subset of mice (n = 40) were administered 108 CFU of probiotics 
daily alongside cefoperazone pretreatment and until experimental endpoints were 
reached. Clinical scoring was performed daily on mice and used to evaluate CDI 
onset and severity. Moderate CDI in mice was defined by survival beyond day 3 
postinfection, while mice with severe CDI were those who succumbed to infection 
prior to day 3 postinfection. Sequencing and analysis of 16S rRNA from stool 
content were performed to determine compositional alterations to the microbiota. 
Using total clinical scores, we identified an association between probiotic 
treatment and delayed onset of primary CDI and relapse by approximately 12 to 
24 h (P < 0.001). The stool microbiome of mice with moderate CDI receiving 
probiotic treatment was significantly enriched with Lachnospiraceae during 
primary CDI (P < 0.05). The outcomes observed present an opportunity to use this 
modified CDI mouse model to examine the efficacy of nonantibiotic options for 
CDI management.

BACKGROUND: The fecal microbiota, fecal bile acid concentrations, and abundance 
of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are altered in acute and 
chronic gastrointestinal disease in adult dogs. However, less is known in young 
puppies.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine composition of the fecal microbiota, assess 
development of fecal bile acid profiles, and determine the abundance of 
Clostridial species in puppies, young adult dogs, and adult dogs.
ANIMALS: Healthy puppies from a whelping kennel (n = 53) and healthy 
client-owned dogs <1 year old (n = 20) were separated into 6 age groups, then 
compared to client-owned dogs over 1 year of age (n = 13).
METHODS: Prospective observational study. Naturally voided fecal samples were 
analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure bacterial 
abundances. Fecal bile acids were quantified using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: Puppies up to 5 to 6 weeks of age had increased Dysbiosis Index (median 
[min-max]: 5.39 [1.32-8.6], P < .001), increased abundance of C. difficile (4.1 
[0.01-4.85] log DNA, P < .001), decreased secondary bile acid concentrations 
(0.61 [0.28-5.06] μg/mg, P = .006), and decreased abundance of C. hiranonis 
(0.84 [0.01-6.71], P = .005) compared to adult dogs (-4.62 [-8.36 to -0.61], 
0.01 [0.01-0.01], 4.12 [0.32-8.94], and 6.02 [5.06-7.00], respectively). 
Secondary bile acid concentration positively correlated with C. hiranonis 
abundance (ρ = 0.77; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The increase in secondary bile acids and 
simultaneous decrease of C. difficile and C. perfringens after 5 to 6 weeks of 
age warrants further investigation into regulatory impacts that secondary bile 
acids could have on clostridial species in dogs.

Clostridium difficile is well known as an agent responsible for pseudomembranous 
colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The hamster model utilizing an oral 
route for infection of C. difficile has been considered to be the standard model 
for analysis of C. difficile infection (CDI) but this model exhibits differences 
to human CDI, most notably as most hamsters die without exhibiting diarrhea. 
Therefore, we attempted to develop a new non-lethal and diarrheal rat CDI model 
caused by endogenous C. difficile using metronidazole (MNZ) and egg white. In 
addition, the effects of probiotic strain Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 
(CBM) on CDI were examined using this model. Syrian Golden hamsters received 
clindamycin phosphate orally at 30 mg/kg on 5 days before challenge with either 
C. difficile VPI10463 (hypertoxigenic strain) or KY34 (low toxigenic clinical 
isolate). Mortality and the presence of diarrhea were observed twice a day for 
the duration of the experiment. Wistar rats received 10% egg white dissolved in 
drinking water for 1 week ad libitum following intramuscular administration of 
200 mg/kg MNZ twice a day for 3 days. Diarrhea score was determined for each day 
and fecal water content, biotin concentration, and cytotoxin titer in feces were 
examined. More than 70% of hamsters orally infected with C. difficile died 
without exhibiting diarrhea regardless of toxigenicity of strain. The rats 
receiving egg white after MNZ administration developed diarrhea due to 
overgrowth of endogenous C. difficile. This CDI model is non-lethal and 
diarrheal, and some rats in this model were spontaneously cured. The incidence 
of diarrhea was significantly decreased in C. butyricum treated rats. These 
results indicate that the CDI model using egg white and MNZ has potentially 
better similarity to human CDI, and implies that treatment with C. butyricum may 
reduce the risk of CDI.

PURPOSE: Existing clinical or microbiological scores are not sensitive enough to 
obtain prompt identification of patients at risk of complicated Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI). Our aim was to use a CDI animal model to evaluate 
2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) as a 
marker of severe course of infection.
PROCEDURES: CDI was induced with cefoperazone for 10 days followed by 
clindamycin 1 day before C. difficile inoculation. Mice were divided into wild 
type (n = 6), antibiotic without infection (AC n = 4), h001-infected (n = 5, 
ribotype 001), and h027-infected (n = 5, ribotype 027). Two days after 
inoculation, [18F]FDG-PET was acquired. Weight, general animal condition, and 
survival were monitored daily for 9 days.
RESULTS: h001 group showed symptoms for 4 days with 0 % mortality and a similar 
colon uptake than control animals (h001 0.52 ± 0.20, WT 0.42 ± 0.07, and AC 
0.36 ± 0.06). The h027 group showed symptoms up to 7 days, with 66.7 % of 
mortality 4 days after infection, and significantly higher colon uptake 
(0.93 ± 0.38, p < 0.05). Clinical score was associated to colon and cecum uptake 
(rho = 0.78, p = 0.0001) (rho = 0.73, p = 0.0003).
CONCLUSION: High toxin producer ribotype 027 induced more severe CDI infections, 
correlating with higher colon and cecum [18F]FDG uptake. Colon uptake may 
purportedly serve as early predictor of CDI severity.

Laboratory confirmation of the causative agent(s) of diarrhoea in puppies may 
allow for appropriate treatment. The presence of potential pathogens however, 
does not prove a causal relationship with diarrhoea. The aim of this study was 
to identify specific enteropathogens in ≤12 month old puppies with and without 
acute diarrhoea and to assess their associations with clinical signs, putative 
risk factors and pathogen co-occurrence. Faecal samples from puppies with 
(n=113) and without (n=56) acute diarrhoea were collected and screened for 
Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV), Salmonella spp., 
Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, β-hemolytic 
Eschericha coli (hEC), Giardia spp., Toxocara spp., Cystoisospora spp., and 
Cyniclomyces guttulatus. One or more pathogens were detected in 86.5% of 
diarrhoeic puppies and in 77.8% of asymptomatic puppies. Significant positive 
associations were found between CPV and CCoV, CPV and Cystoisospora spp., 
Toxocara spp. and hEC, Giardia spp. and C. guttulatus. Only CPV and CCoV were 
significantly associated with diarrhoea, hEC with a subset of puppies that had 
diarrhoea and severe clinical signs. CPV was more prevalent in puppies under 3 
months of age. Puppies from high-volume dog breeders were significantly at 
increased risk for CPV (OR 4.20), CCoV (OR 4.50) and Cystoisospora spp. (OR 
3.60). CCoV occurred significantly more often in winter (OR 3.35), and CPV in 
winter (OR 3.78) and spring (OR 4.72) as compared to summer. We conclude that 
routine screening for CPV, CCoV and hEC is recommended in puppies with acute 
diarrhoea, especially if they are under 3 months of age and originate from 
high-volume dog breeders. Routine screening for other pathogens may lead to less 
conclusive results.

AIMS: To determine the presence of Clostridium difficile on fattening pig farms 
in north-eastern Spain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-seven farms were sampled. Pools of pig faecal 
samples (n = 210), samples of intestinal content from common farm pest species 
(n = 95) and environment-related samples (n = 93) were collected. Isolates were 
tested for toxin genes of C. difficile, and typed by PCR-ribotyping and 
toxinotyping. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobial agents 
were determined using Etest. Thirty-four isolates were obtained from 12 farms, 
and 30 (88·2%) had toxin genes. Seven ribotypes were identified. Ribotype 078 
and its variant 126 were predominant (52·9%). The same ribotypes were isolated 
from different animal species on the same farm. None of the isolates were 
resistant to metronidazole or vancomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile was common within the pig farm environment. 
Most of the positive samples came from pest species or were pest-related 
environmental samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pest species were colonized with toxigenic 
and antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile strains of the same ribotypes that are 
found in humans and pigs. Rodents and pigeons may transmit toxigenic and 
antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile strains that are of the same ribotypes as 
those occuring in humans.

Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) are a major cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is hypothesized that CDI develops due to the 
antibiotic-induced disruption of the intestinal microbial community structure, 
which allows C. difficile to flourish. Here, we pre-treated weaned pigs with the 
antibiotics Clindamycin or Ciprofloxacin for 1 day, and subsequently inoculated 
them with a human and pig enteropathogenic C. difficile strain 078 spores. Body 
temperature, clinical signs of disease, and the fecal microbiome were monitored 
daily for 15 days. Clindamycin had a stronger effect on the pigs than 
Ciprofloxacin, resulting in drastic shifts in the fecal microbiome, decreases in 
microbial diversity and significant increases in body temperature, even in the 
absence of C. difficile. Fecal shedding of C. difficile was detectable for 3 and 
9 days in Ciprofloxacin and Clindamycin treated pigs inoculated with C. 
difficile, respectively, and in both cases decreased cell proliferation rates 
were detected in colon tissue. The timing of C. difficile shedding coincided 
with the decrease in a large cluster of Firmicutes following Clindamycin 
treatment, a pattern which was also independent of C. difficile inoculation. The 
observed community patterns suggest that successional dynamics following 
antibiotic treatment facilitate C. difficile establishment. The similarities 
between the microbiome responses observed in our study and those previously 
reported in CDI-infected humans further support the utility of adult pigs as 
models for the study of CDI.

Clostridium difficile can cause neonatal enteritis, but has been isolated from 
both diseased and healthy pigs. C. difficile shedding by pigs is a potential 
source of zoonotic transmission to humans. The objectives of this study were to 
characterize the prevalence and genotype of C. difficile with respect to age and 
health status in the pig industry for the first time in Korea. Fecal samples of 
910 pigs were analyzed for the presence of C. difficile. In total, 176 (19.3%) 
C. difficile strains were isolated. The prevalence was significantly higher 
(p < 0.01) in diarrheic samples (30.4%) than in non-diarrheic samples (13.3%). 
The prevalence was highest in diarrheic suckling piglets (53.6%), followed by 
diarrheic sows (40.0%) and non-diarrheic suckling piglets (34.0%). The toxin 
genes tcdA, tcdB, cdtA, and cdtB were all detected in 153 isolates (A+B+CDT+, 
86.9%). Furthermore, the majority of toxigenic strains (86.5%) were identified 
as PCR ribotype 078, which is an important pathogen in both pigs and humans. 
These results indicated that C. difficile is a leading causative pathogen of 
neonatal diarrhea in piglets in Korea.

Clostridium difficile may be an emerging community-associated pathogen but 
little is known about its sources of exposure. This study evaluated C. difficile 
contamination in households and colonization of pets. C. difficile was isolated 
from 44/836 (5.3%) sites in 26/84 (31%) households. Ribotype 027 was the most 
common (25%) environmental strain. C. difficile was isolated from 14/139 (10%) 
dogs. Living with an immunocompromised individual was associated with C. 
difficile colonization in dogs. All toxigenic strains identified in pets have 
been isolated from humans in Ontario. C. difficile was isolated concurrently 
from dogs and the environment in four households, but in all cases canine and 
environmental ribotypes were different. C. difficile was relatively common in 
households, suggesting that exposure to this pathogen may be a regular event. 
There was no evidence that dogs are a significant source of household C. 
difficile contamination.

Clostridium difficile in one of the most commonly reported nosocomial pathogens 
worldwide. Beyond antibiotic use, little is known about the host, microbiota, 
and environmental factors that contribute to susceptibility to and severity of 
C. difficile infection (CDI). We recently observed that in a mouse model of CDI, 
excess dietary zinc (Zn) alters the gut microbiota and decreases resistance to 
CDI. Moreover, we determined that high levels of Zn exacerbate C. 
difficile-associated disease and calprotectin-mediated Zn limitation is an 
essential host response to infection. In this addendum, we discuss how these 
findings add to our understanding of CDI and consider the potential implications 
of excess metal intake on the microbiota and infection.

Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea in both humans and 
animals. The ribotype 078, predominant in food animals, is associated with 
community-acquired C. difficile infection, and C. difficile is suggested to be a 
foodborne pathogen. Recently, the C. difficile ribotype 078 lineage emerged in 
patients and pigs in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and 
molecular characterization of C. difficile isolated from a pig slaughterhouse, 
retail meat, ready-to-eat meals, and humans in Taiwan. We collected samples from 
one slaughterhouse (n=422), 29 retail markets (raw pork, n=62; ready-to-eat 
pork, n=65), and one hospital (non-diarrheal humans, stool, n=317) in 2015. The 
isolated C. difficile were subjected to ribotyping and multilocus 
variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). In the slaughterhouse, the 
isolation rate from carcasses was high (23%, 21/92) and ribotype 126 dominated. 
Scalding water was found to have C. difficile contamination (44%, 4/9), and two 
of the seven isolates were ribotype 126. The isolation rates from raw pork and 
ready-to-eat pork were between 20% and 29%. Ribotypes 126, 127, and 014 were 
found in raw pork, whereas ribotype 078 was not identified in this study. Eight 
isolates-seven non-toxigenic isolates and one ribotype 017-were found in 
non-diarrheal human samples. Notably, MLVA showed that ribotype 126 isolates 
from the slaughterhouse, pig stool, colons, carcasses, and scalding water were 
closely genetically related, indicating serious risk for cross-contamination. 
However, the genetic evidence of foodborne transmission from carcasses to food 
and humans is still lacking.

AIM: To evaluate the effect on the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
indomethacin on Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) severity.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Indomethacin was administered in two different mouse models 
of antibiotic-associated CDI in two different facilities, using a low and high 
dose of indomethacin.
RESULTS: Indomethacin administration caused weight loss, increased the signs of 
severe infection and worsened histopathological damage, leading to 100% 
mortality during CDI. Indomethacin-treated, antibiotic-exposed mice infected 
with C. difficile had enhanced intestinal inflammation with increased expression 
of KC, IL-1β and IL-22 compared with infected mice unexposed to indomethacin.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a negative impact of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs on antibiotic-associated CDI in mice and suggest that 
targeting the synthesis or signaling of prostaglandins might be an approach to 
ameliorating the severity of CDI.

Despite extensive research on the epidemiology of pathogenic clostridia in dogs 
and cats, most published studies focus on a selected animal population and/or a 
single veterinary medical centre. We assessed the burden of Clostridium 
perfringens and C. difficile shedding by small animals in 17 veterinary clinics 
located within the Madrid region (Spain) and differing in size, number and 
features of animals attended and other relevant characteristics. In addition, we 
studied the genetic diversity and antibiotic susceptibility of recovered 
isolates. Selective culture of all fecal specimens collected during a single 
week from dogs (n = 105) and cats (n = 37) attended in participating clinics 
yielded C. perfringens/C. difficile from 31%, 4.8% of the dogs, and 20%, 0% of 
the cats analyzed, respectively, and three dogs yielded both species. 
Furthermore, 17 animals (15 dogs and two cats) that yielded a positive culture 
for either species were recruited for a follow-up survey and C. perfringens was 
again obtained from nine dogs. Considerable differences in prevalence were 
observed among participating clinics for both clostridial species. 
C. perfringens isolates (n = 109) belonged to toxinotypes A (97.2%) and E (three 
isolates from one dog), whereas C. difficile isolates (n = 18) belonged to the 
toxigenic ribotypes 106 (33.3%) and 154 (16.7%), a 009-like ribotype (33.3%) and 
an unknown non-toxigenic ribotype (16.7%). Amplified fragment length 
polymorphism-based fingerprinting classified C. perfringens and C. difficile 
isolates into 105 and 15 genotypes, respectively, and tested isolates displayed 
in vitro resistance to benzylpenicillin (2.8%, 88.8%), clindamycin (0%, 16.7%), 
erythromycin (0.9%, 16.7%), imipenem (1.8%, 100%), levofloxacin (0.9%, 100%), 
linezolid (5.5%, 0%), metronidazole (4.6%, 0%) and/or tetracycline (7.3%, 0%). 
All animals from which multiple isolates were retrieved yielded ≥2 different 
genotypes and/or antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Future studies should 
focus on the seasonal and geographical variations of prevalence and diversity 
patterns of clostridial species in small animals.

Although Clostridium difficile is widely considered an antibiotic- and 
hospital-associated pathogen, recent evidence indicates that this is an 
insufficient depiction of the risks and reservoirs. A common thread that links 
all major risk factors of infection is their association with gastrointestinal 
disturbances, but this relationship to C. difficile colonization has never been 
tested directly. Here, we show that disturbances caused by diarrhoeal events 
trigger susceptibility to C. difficile colonization. Using survey data of the 
human gut microbiome, we detected C. difficile colonization and blooms in people 
recovering from food poisoning and Vibrio cholerae infections. Carriers remained 
colonized for year-long time scales and experienced highly variable patterns of 
C. difficile abundance, where increased shedding over short periods of 1-2 d 
interrupted week-long periods in which C. difficile was undetectable. Given that 
short shedding events were often linked to gastrointestinal disturbances, our 
results help explain why C. difficile is frequently detected as a co-infecting 
pathogen in patients with diarrhoea. To directly test the impact of diarrhoea on 
susceptibility to colonization, we developed a mouse model of variable 
disturbance intensity, which allowed us to monitor colonization in the absence 
of disease. As mice exposed to avirulent C. difficile spores ingested increasing 
quantities of laxatives, more individuals experienced C. difficile blooms. Our 
results indicate that the likelihood of colonization is highest in the days 
immediately following acute disturbances, suggesting that this could be an 
important window during which transmission could be interrupted and the 
incidence of infection lowered.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the primary cause of nosocomial 
diarrhea in the United States. Although C. difficile toxins A and B are the 
primary mediators of CDI, the overall pathophysiology underlying C. 
difficile-associated diarrhea remains poorly understood. Studies have shown that 
a decrease in both NHE3 (Na+/H+ exchanger) and DRA (downregulated in adenoma, 
Cl-/[Formula: see text] exchanger), resulting in decreased electrolyte 
absorption, is implicated in infectious and inflammatory diarrhea. Furthermore, 
studies have shown that NHE3 is depleted at the apical surface of intestinal 
epithelial cells and downregulated in patients with CDI, but the role of DRA in 
CDI remains unknown. In the current studies, we examined the effects of C. 
difficile toxins TcdA and TcdB on DRA protein and mRNA levels in intestinal 
epithelial cells (IECs). Our data demonstrated that DRA protein levels were 
significantly reduced in response to TcdA and TcdB in IECs in culture. This 
effect was also specific to DRA, as NHE3 and PAT-1 (putative anion transporter 
1) protein levels were unaffected by TcdA and TcdB. Additionally, purified TcdA 
and TcdA + TcdB, but not TcdB, resulted in a decrease in colonic DRA protein 
levels in a toxigenic mouse model of CDI. Finally, patients with recurrent CDI 
also exhibited significantly reduced expression of colonic DRA protein. 
Together, these findings indicate that C. difficile toxins markedly downregulate 
intestinal expression of DRA which may contribute to the diarrheal phenotype of 
CDI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our studies demonstrate, for the first time, that C. 
difficile toxins reduce DRA protein, but not mRNA, levels in intestinal 
epithelial cells. These findings suggest that a downregulation of DRA may be a 
critical factor in C. difficile infection-associated diarrhea.

Clostridium difficile has been documented as a major cause of uncontrolled 
outbreaks of enteritis in neonatal pigs and antibiotic-associated infections in 
clinical settings. It belongs to the natural cohort of early colonisers of the 
gastrointestinal tract of pigs and can be detected in faeces up to two weeks 
post-partum. In older pigs, it often remains under the detection limit. Most 
neonatal pigs show no clinical signs of disease although C. difficile and its 
toxins can be detected at high levels in faeces. Increased mortality rates 
associated with C. difficile on pig farms are, so far, considered "spontaneous" 
and the predisposing factors are mostly not defined. The infection caused by C. 
difficile is multifactorial and it is likely that the repertoire of maternal 
factors, host physiology, the individually developing gut microbiota, 
co-infections and environmental stress define the conditions for disease 
development. In this addendum to our recently published work on CDI in neonatal 
piglets, we discuss the "early-life events" that influence C. difficile spread 
and infection in neonatal piglets.

Clostridium (syn. Clostridioides) difficile is considered a pioneer colonizer 
and may cause gut infection in neonatal piglets. The aim of this study was to 
explore the microbiota-C. difficile associations in pigs. We used the DNA from 
the faeces of four sows collected during the periparturient period and from two 
to three of their piglets (collected weekly until nine weeks of age) for the 
determination of bacterial community composition (sequencing) and C. difficile 
concentration (qPCR). Furthermore, C. difficile-negative faeces were enriched in 
a growth medium, followed by qPCR to verify the presence of this bacterium. 
Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1 and Lactobacillus spp. predominated the gut 
microbiota of the sows and their offspring. C. difficile was detected at least 
once in the faeces of all sows during the entire sampling period, albeit at low 
concentrations. Suckling piglets harboured C. difficile in high concentrations 
(up to log10 9.29 copy number/g faeces), which gradually decreased as the 
piglets aged. Enrichment revealed the presence of C. difficile in previously C. 
difficile-negative sow and offspring faeces. In suckling piglets, the C. 
difficile level was negatively correlated with carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria, 
and it was positively associated with potential pathogens. Shannon and richness 
diversity indices were negatively associated with the C. difficile counts in 
suckling piglets. This study showed that gut microbiota seems to set conditions 
for colonisation resistance against C. difficile in the offspring. However, this 
conclusion requires further research to include host-specific factors.

and Clostridium difficile co-infection in adult dogs. Both animals were positive 
for A/B toxin. Toxigenic C. difficile and C. perfringens type A positive for 
NetE and NetF-encoding genes were isolated. This report reinforces the necessity 
of studying a possible synergism of C. difficile and C. perfringens in enteric 
disorders.

Clostridium difficile is increasingly recognized as an important enteropathogen 
in both humans and animals. The finding of C. difficile in air samples in 
hospitals suggests a role for aerial dissemination in the transmission of human 
C. difficile infection. The present study was designed to investigate the 
occurrence of airborne C. difficile in, and nearby a pig farm with a high 
prevalence of C. difficile. Airborne colony counts in the farrowing pens peaked 
on the moments shortly after or during personnel activity in the pens (P=0.043 
(farrowing pens 1, 2), P=0.034 (farrowing pen 2)). A decrease in airborne C. 
difficile colony counts was observed parallel to aging of the piglets. Airborne 
C. difficile was detected up to 20 m distant from the farm. This study showed 
widespread aerial dissemination of C. difficile on a pig farm that was 
positively associated with personnel activity.

Clostridium difficile vaccines composed of surface polysaccharides (PSs) have 
the potential to simultaneously control infection and colonization levels in 
humans. Hot water-phenol treatment of C. difficile biomass can extricate 
water-soluble PS-I and PS-II; and water- and phenol-soluble PS-III. C. difficile 
vaccines based on PS-II have attracted the most attention due its facile 
purification and ubiquitous expression by C. difficile ribotypes. Anti PS-II 
antibodies recognize both C. difficile vegetative cell and sporulating 
preparations and confer protection against C. difficile infection in a mouse 
model. The design of such an efficacious C. difficile PS-II conjugate vaccine is 
described here.

Clostridium difficile is an emerging enteropathogen responsible for 
pseudomembranous colitis in humans and diarrhoea in several domestic and wild 
animal species. Despite its known importance, there are few studies about C. 
difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotypes in Brazil and the actual 
knowledge is restricted to studies on human isolates. The aim of the study was 
therefore to compare C. difficile ribotypes isolated from humans and animals in 
Brazil. Seventy-six C. difficile strains isolated from humans (n = 25), dogs (n 
= 23), piglets (n = 12), foals (n = 7), calves (n = 7), one cat, and one manned 
wolf were distributed into 24 different PCR ribotypes. Among toxigenic strains, 
PCR ribotypes 014/020 and 106 were the most common, accounting for 14 (18.4%) 
and eight (10.5%) samples, respectively. Fourteen different PCR ribotypes were 
detected among human isolates, nine of them have also been identified in at 
least one animal species. PCR ribotype 027 was not detected, whereas 078 were 
found only in foals. This data suggests a high diversity of PCR ribotypes in 
humans and animals in Brazil and support the discussion of C. difficile as a 
zoonotic pathogen.

Clostridium difficile is associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis in humans. Its 2 major toxins, toxins A and B, enter 
host cells and inactivate GTPases of the Ras homologue/rat sarcoma family by 
glucosylation. Pore formation of the toxins in the endosomal membrane enables 
the translocation of their glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol, and 
membrane cholesterol is crucial for this process. Here, we asked whether the 
activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) pathway, 
which regulates the cholesterol content in membranes, affects the susceptibility 
of target cells toward toxins A and B. We show that the SREBP-2 pathway is 
crucial for the intoxication process of toxins A and B by using pharmacological 
inhibitors (PF-429242, 25-hydroxycholesterol) and cells that are specifically 
deficient in SREBP-2 pathway signaling. SREBP-2 pathway inhibition disturbed the 
cholesterol-dependent pore formation of toxin B in cellular membranes. 
Preincubation with the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin protected cells 
from toxin B intoxication. Inhibition of the SREBP-2 pathway was without effect 
when the enzyme portion of toxin B was introduced into target cells via the cell 
delivery property of anthrax protective antigen. Taken together, these findings 
allowed us to identify the SREBP-2 pathway as a suitable target for the 
development of antitoxin therapeutics against C. difficile toxins A and

Gastrointestinal infections often induce epithelial damage that must be repaired 
for optimal gut function. While intestinal stem cells are critical for this 
regeneration process [R. C. van der Wath, B. S. Gardiner, A. W. Burgess, D. W. 
Smith, PLoS One 8, e73204 (2013); S. Kozar et al., Cell Stem Cell 13, 626-633 
(2013)], how they are impacted by enteric infections remains poorly defined. 
Here, we investigate infection-mediated damage to the colonic stem cell 
compartment and how this affects epithelial repair and recovery from infection. 
Using the pathogen Clostridioides difficile, we show that infection disrupts 
murine intestinal cellular organization and integrity deep into the epithelium, 
to expose the otherwise protected stem cell compartment, in a TcdB-mediated 
process. Exposure and susceptibility of colonic stem cells to intoxication 
compromises their function during infection, which diminishes their ability to 
repair the injured epithelium, shown by altered stem cell signaling and a 
reduction in the growth of colonic organoids from stem cells isolated from 
infected mice. We also show, using both mouse and human colonic organoids, that 
TcdB from epidemic ribotype 027 strains does not require Frizzled 1/2/7 binding 
to elicit this dysfunctional stem cell state. This stem cell dysfunction induces 
a significant delay in recovery and repair of the intestinal epithelium of up to 
2 wk post the infection peak. Our results uncover a mechanism by which an 
enteric pathogen subverts repair processes by targeting stem cells during 
infection and preventing epithelial regeneration, which prolongs epithelial 
barrier impairment and creates an environment in which disease recurrence is 
likely.

Despite being incapable of causing Clostridium difficile infection, 
non-toxigenic C. difficile (NTCD) may still be relevant. This study explored the 
role of NTCD as a reservoir of accessory antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in 
NTCD from Southeast Asia. This region has high rates of antimicrobial use, a 
high prevalence of NTCD and phenotypic AMR in such strains. More than half of 
the 28 NTCD strains investigated had at least one accessory AMR gene on mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs) which were similar to the elements found in other 
bacteria, including Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Streptococcus suis, both of 
which are found in the pig gut. Thus, C. difficile may facilitate the movement 
of AMR genes between different hosts within a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. 
C. difficile β-lactamases were not located on MGEs and were unlikely to be 
transferred. Concordance between the MLSB resistance genotype and phenotype was 
low, suggesting multiple resistance mechanisms, many of which remain unknown. On 
the contrary, there was a high concordance between resistance genotype and 
phenotype for both fluoroquinolones and rifaximin. From an epidemiological 
perspective, NTCD populations in Southeast Asia comprised members of 
evolutionary clades 1 and 4, which are thought to have originated from Europe 
and Asia, respectively. This population structure reflects the close 
relationship between the people of the two regions.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) and C difficile toxin 
toxin B (TcdB), the major virulence factors of the bacterium, cause intestinal 
tissue damage and inflammation. Although the 2 toxins are homologous and share a 
similar domain structure, TcdA is generally more inflammatory whereas TcdB is 
more cytotoxic. The functional domain of the toxins that govern the 
proinflammatory activities of the 2 toxins is unknown.
METHODS: Here, we investigated toxin domain functions that regulate the 
proinflammatory activity of C difficile toxins. By using a mouse ilea loop 
model, human tissues, and immune cells, we examined the inflammatory responses 
to a series of chimeric toxins or toxin mutants deficient in specific domain 
functions.
RESULTS: Blocking autoprocessing of TcdB by mutagenesis or chemical inhibition, 
while reducing cytotoxicity of the toxin, significantly enhanced its 
proinflammatory activities in the animal model. Furthermore, a noncleavable 
mutant TcdB was significantly more potent than the wild-type toxin in the 
induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human colonic tissues and immune 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a novel mechanism of regulating the 
biological activities of C difficile toxins in that cysteine protease-mediated 
autoprocessing regulates toxins' proinflammatory activities. Our findings 
provide new insight into the pathogenesis of C difficile infection and the 
design of therapeutics against the disease.

Pigs, particularly piglets, have been identified as reservoir hosts of 
Clostridium difficile. To examine the survival ability of this pathogen in pig 
feces-based manure compost, C. difficile spores, which were prepared to contain 
as few vegetative cells as possible, were artificially inoculated into pig feces 
and incubated at different temperatures. While C. difficile survived in the 
feces incubated at temperatures below 37 °C for over 30 days, cell numbers 
gradually decreased at thermophilic temperatures (over 55 °C; p < 0.05). Next, 
to clarify the prevalence of C. difficile in field manure compost, we isolated 
and characterized C. difficile from the final products of manure compost 
products of 14 pig farms. A total of 11 C. difficile strains were isolated from 
5 of 14 (36% positive rate) samples tested. Of these 11 strains, 82% were 
toxigenic, with ribotype 078 being the most prevalent. Thus, the application of 
composted manure to land therefore poses a possible risk of C. difficile 
transfer to the food chain.

Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a second messenger that regulates the 
transition from motile to sessile lifestyles in numerous bacteria and controls 
virulence factor production in a variety of pathogens. In Clostridium difficile, 
c-di-GMP negatively regulates flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility and 
promotes the production of type IV pili (TFP), biofilm formation, and surface 
motility in vitro Flagella have been identified as colonization factors in C. 
difficile, but the role of TFP in adherence to host cells and in colonization of 
the mammalian gut is unknown. Here we show that c-di-GMP promotes adherence to 
epithelial cells in vitro, which can be partly attributed to the loss of 
flagella. Using TFP-null mutants, we demonstrate that adherence to epithelial 
cells is partially mediated by TFP and that this TFP-mediated adherence requires 
c-di-GMP regulation. In a mouse model of colonization, the TFP-null mutants 
initially colonized the intestine as well as the parental strain but were 
cleared more quickly. Moreover, compared to the parent strain, C. difficile 
strains lacking TFP were particularly deficient in association with the cecal 
mucosa. Together these data indicate that TFP and their positive regulation by 
c-di-GMP promote attachment of C. difficile to the intestinal epithelium and 
contribute to persistence of C. difficile in the host intestine.

Background: Clostridium difficile infection is the most common cause of 
antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. Our aim was to introduce a novel and 
efficient clinical sickness score (CSS), and to define a detailed histologic 
injury score (HIS) in a murine model of C. difficile colitis. Methods: Mice 
received an antibiotic cocktail (kanamycin, gentamicin, colistin, metronidazole, 
and vancomycin) for 96 h. After 48 h, mice received an intraperitoneal injection 
of clindamycin, followed by oral C. difficile (1.5 × 107 CFU). Signs of sickness 
were scored using a novel CSS (range 0-12) with scores ≥6 consistent with C. 
difficile colitis. Intestinal tissue was analyzed utilizing an adapted HIS 
(range 0-9) with scores ≥4 consistent with C. difficile colitis. Stool was 
analyzed for C. difficile, and survival evaluated. Results: No control mice 
showed signs of sickness, whereas 23% of mice receiving antibiotics alone and 
65% of mice exposed to antibiotics and subsequently C. difficile demonstrated 
signs of sickness (p = 0.0134). No control mice had histologic injury, whereas 
8% of mice receiving antibiotics alone and 75% of mice exposed to antibiotics 
followed by C. difficile had evidence of histologic injury (p = 0.0001). Mice 
exposed to C. difficile lost more weight, although not significant (p = 0.070). 
Mice that received C. difficile had decreased survival compared to control mice 
and mice receiving antibiotics only (p = 0.03). Conclusions: We have developed a 
novel clinical scoring system, and detailed histological grading system, that 
enables the objective evaluation of a murine C. difficile colitis model. This 
model allows the study of this disease in a host that demonstrates clinical and 
histologic signs comparable to human C. difficile infection. This will allow for 
improved study of therapeutics for this disease in the future.

Clostridium difficile is an important enteric pathogen in humans causing 
infections in the healthcare environment and the community. Carriage of 
C. difficile and C. difficile-related enterocolitis has been reported in piglets 
worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of C. difficile 
isolation from pigs in Ireland. Faecal samples from piglet litters and sows were 
collected from six farms in 2015. The sows were non-diarrhoeal at the time of 
sampling. The diarrhoeal status of the piglets was unknown. C. difficile was 
isolated from 34/44 (77%) of piglet litter samples and from 33/156 (21%) of sow 
samples. The isolation rate in sows varied from 3 to 39% and in piglet litters 
from 72 to 86% depending on farm location. Toxin A and toxin B were present in 
99% (66/67) of isolates; and binary toxin in 85% (57/67). Only PCR-ribotypes 078 
(88%) and 193 (12%) were identified in piglets. Seven PCR-ribotypes were 
detected in sow C. difficile isolates: PCR-ribotypes 078 (67%), 050 (12%), 
014/020 (6%), 015 (6%), 029 (3%), 035 (3%) and 193 (3%). This study shows that 
toxigenic C. difficile strains such as PCR-ribotype 078 can be commonly isolated 
from pigs at different geographical locations in Ireland. Since PCR-ribotype 078 
is frequently found in humans in Ireland, this highlights the potential for 
interspecies transmission.

Clostridium difficile causes diarrhea and colitis by releasing toxin A and toxin 
B. In the human colon, both toxins cause intestinal inflammation and stimulate 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression via the activation of NF-κB. It 
is well established that the macrolide antibiotic fidaxomicin is associated with 
reduced relapses of C. difficile infection. We showed that fidaxomicin and its 
primary metabolite OP-1118 significantly inhibited toxin A-mediated intestinal 
inflammation in mice in vivo and toxin A-induced cell rounding in vitro We aim 
to determine whether fidaxomicin and OP-1118 possess anti-inflammatory effects 
against toxin A and toxin B in the human colon and examine the mechanism of this 
response. We used fresh human colonic explants, NCM460 human colonic epithelial 
cells, and RAW264.7 mouse macrophages to study the mechanism of the activity of 
fidaxomicin and OP-1118 against toxin A- and B-mediated cytokine expression and 
apoptosis. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 dose-dependently inhibited toxin A- and 
B-induced TNF-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) mRNA expression and histological 
damage in human colonic explants. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 inhibited toxin 
A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation in human and mouse intestinal mucosae. 
Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 also inhibited toxin A-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation 
and TNF-α expression in macrophages, which was reversed by the NF-κB activator 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 prevented toxin A- and 
B-mediated apoptosis in NCM460 cells, which was reversed by the addition of PMA. 
PMA reversed the cytoprotective effect of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 in 
toxin-exposed human colonic explants. Fidaxomicin and OP-1118 inhibit C. 
difficile toxin A- and B-mediated inflammatory responses, NF-κB phosphorylation, 
and tissue damage in the human colon.

The immunogenicity of bacterial flagellin has been reported in different 
studies. By its close interaction with the immune system, the flagellin 
represents an interesting adjuvant and vaccine candidate. Salmonella Typhimurium 
flagellin has already been tested as adjuvant to stimulate mucosal immunity. 
Here, we assessed the ability of Clostridium difficile flagellin FliC to act as 
a mucosal adjuvant, first combined with ovalbumin as antigen and second with a 
C. difficile surface protein, the precursor of the S-layer proteins SlpA. Using 
ovalbumin as antigen, we compared the gut mucosal adjuvanticity of FliC to 
Salmonella Typhimurium flagellin and cholera toxin. Two routes of immunization 
were tested in a mouse model: intra-rectal and intra-peritoneal, following 
which, gut mucosal and systemic antibody responses against ovalbumin 
(Immunoglobulins G and Immunoglobulins A) were analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immuno 
Assay in intestinal contents and in sera. In addition, ovalbumin-specific 
immunoglobulin producing cells were detected in the intestinal lamina propria by 
Enzyme-Linked Immunospot. Results showed that FliC as adjuvant for immunization 
targeting ovalbumin was able to stimulate a gut mucosal and systemic antibody 
response independently of the immunization route. In order to develop a mucosal 
vaccine to prevent C. difficile intestinal colonization, we assessed in a mouse 
model the efficacy of FliC as adjuvant compared with cholera toxin 
co-administrated with the C. difficile S-layer precursor SlpA as antigen. After 
challenge, a significant decrease of C. difficile intestinal colonization was 
observed in immunized groups compared to the control group. Our results showed 
that C. difficile FliC could be used as adjuvant in mucosal vaccination strategy 
against C. difficile infections.

Between October 2016 and June 2017, a C57BL/6J mouse colony that was undergoing 
a pre- and perinatal methyl donor supplementation diet intervention to study the 
impact of parental nutrition on offspring susceptibility to disease was found to 
suffer from an epizootic of unexpected deaths. Necropsy revealed the presence of 
severe colitis, and further investigation linked these outbreak deaths to a 
Clostridium difficile strain of ribotype 027 that we term 16N203. C. difficile 
infection (CDI) is associated with antibiotic use in humans. Current murine 
models of CDI rely on antibiotic pretreatment to establish clinical phenotypes. 
In this report, the C. difficile outbreak occurs in F1 mice linked to 
alterations in the parental diet. The diagnosis of CDI in the affected mice was 
confirmed by cecal/colonic histopathology, the presence of C. difficile bacteria 
in fecal/colonic culture, and detection of C. difficile toxins. F1 mice from 
parents fed the methyl supplementation diet also had significantly reduced 
survival (P < 0.0001) compared with F1 mice from parents fed the control diet. 
When we tested the 16N203 outbreak strain in an established mouse model of 
antibiotic-induced CDI, we confirmed that this strain is pathogenic. Our 
serendipitous observations from this spontaneous outbreak of C. difficile in 
association with a pre- and perinatal methyl donor diet suggest the important 
role that diet may play in host defense and CDI risk factors.IMPORTANCE 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the leading cause of infectious 
diarrhea in hospitals worldwide, owing its preeminence to the emergence of 
hyperendemic strains, such as ribotype 027 (RT027). A major CDI risk factor is 
antibiotic exposure, which alters gut microbiota, resulting in the loss of 
colonization resistance. Current murine models of CDI also depend on 
pretreatment of animals with antibiotics to establish disease. The outbreak that 
we report here is unique in that the CDI occurred in mice with no antibiotic 
exposure and is associated with a pre- and perinatal methyl supplementation 
donor diet intervention study. Our investigation subsequently reveals that the 
outbreak strain that we term 16N203 is an RT027 strain, and this isolated strain 
is also pathogenic in an established murine model of CDI (with antibiotics). Our 
report of this spontaneous outbreak offers additional insight into the 
importance of environmental factors, such as diet, and CDI susceptibility.

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of hospital- and 
antimicrobial-associated diarrhea in hospitalized humans however the role of C. 
difficile in diarrhea in dogs has not been defined. A prospective study of C. 
difficile colonization in dogs and cats was conducted in a veterinary teaching 
hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Rectal swabs were taken from patients upon 
admission to the ICU and every third day of hospitalization until discharge or 
death. C. difficile was isolated from 73/402 (18%) animals; 69% of isolates were 
toxigenic. Community-associated colonization was identified in 39/366 (11%) of 
animals that were sampled at the time of admission, while C. difficile was 
subsequently isolated from 27 of the remaining 327 (8.3%) animals that had a 
negative admission swab. C. difficile was isolated from seven other dogs during 
hospitalization, but the origin was unclear because the admission swab was not 
collected. Administration of antimicrobials prior to admission and 
administration of immunosuppressive drugs during hospitalization were risk 
factors for hospital-associated colonization (P=0.006, OR 4.05, 95% CI 
1.4-10.8). Acquisition of C. difficile during hospitalization in the ICU was 
associated with the development of diarrhea (P=0.004). Two ribotypes, one 
toxigenic and one non-toxigenic, predominated.

Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are powerful modulators of microbiota 
composition and function. These substrates are often derived from diet, such as 
complex polysaccharides from plants or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) during 
breastfeeding. Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve 
as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we 
investigate the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in 
maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and 
purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy 
in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found 
that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar 
resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after 
antibiotic treatment, suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset 
of diet-induced obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident 
Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with 
mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare 
in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being 
selected for during host development and throughout the evolution of the 
host-microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel 
class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the 
microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile are 
important human pathogens that are also carried by animals. The role of wild 
mammals on farms in their maintenance and transmission, however, is poorly 
understood. To determine if Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are potential 
carriers of these bacteria on Canadian farms, we tested 21 rats from swine farms 
in Ontario. The MRSA spa type t034 was isolated from 1 (4.8%) rat. This 
livestock-associated strain often colonizes pigs and pig farmers, suggesting 
that transmission among rats and pigs or environmental transmission is possible 
on pig farms. Clostridium difficile ribotype 078 was isolated from 1 rat from a 
different farm. This strain is associated with infection in piglets, calves, and 
humans. The identification of MRSA and C. difficile in Norway rats on farms in 
Canada adds to the growing knowledge about the role of rats in the ecology of 
these pathogens. Further studies are required to determine if rats play a part 
in the epidemiology of these pathogens on farms.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become a growing health concern, as 
evident from the increase in the mortality rate among elderly or hospitalized 
patients. Treatment of CDI is usually based on antibiotics (metronidazole and 
vancomycin), but it has some limitations, including cost and antibiotic 
resistance. Probiotics could offer an effective remedy to prevent CDI and could 
be an auxiliary agent in treatment CDI. Here, the anti-clostridial activity of a 
newly isolated probiotic strain, Pediococcus acidilactici SPM138 (SPM138) was 
evaluated. The cultivation of C. difficile (CD) with SPM138, inhibited the 
growth of CD and significantly reduced CD toxins level. The result of MTT assay 
showed that, incubation with 25% CD culture supernatant decreased the survival 
rate of HT-29 cells to less than 20%. However, the survival rate of these cells 
increased to 98% in the presence of the 25% CD + SPM138 supernatant. The mRNA 
expression of IL-6, IL-8 and PTGS2 in HT-29 cells decreased by more than 60% 
upon incubation with CD + SPM138 co-cultures as compared to the levels observed 
after treatment with CD supernatant only. The concentration of IL-8 also 
decreased by more than 60% upon treatment with CD + SPM138 co-culture 
supernatant. In a C. difficile PCR ribotype 027-infected mouse model, the 
concentration of CD toxin in stool samples of SPM138-fed mice was only 37% of 
that reported in C. difficile 027-infected group. These findings show that 
P. acidilactici SPM138 may be a promising probiotic in CDI.

Mice in buildings are a hygiene hazard because they harbour several zoonoses and 
animal diseases. The aim of this study was to gather information on specific 
bacteria in house mice caught in the urban environment. Mice caught in snap 
traps during pest control activities were collected in and around the city of 
Utrecht, the Netherlands, during May-June 2014, October-November 2015 and 
September-November 2016. The gut contents were analysed for ESBL/AmpC-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp., and Clostridium difficile and the buccal 
cavities were swabbed for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In total, 109 
house mice (Mus musculus) and 22 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were examined. 
One mouse was found positive for Enterobacter spp. Salmonella spp. and MRSA were 
not found. Of n = 80 mice, 35·0% carried C. difficile (ribotypes in descending 
order of frequency: 014/020, 258, 002, 005, 013, 056, 081 and two unknown 
ribotypes). In conclusion, mouse droppings are a hazard for transmission of C. 
difficile to humans and their environment.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that mice in buildings 
can carry Clostridium difficile ribotypes that are associated with clinical 
disease in humans. Whether the mice are the source or whether they picked up 
these bacteria from the human environment has not been investigated. Either way, 
mouse droppings in the indoor environment are a hazard for transmission of C. 
difficile to humans.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobe and a major 
cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Disruption of the commensal 
microbiota, such as through treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, is a 
critical precursor for colonisation by C. difficile and subsequent disease. 
Furthermore, failure of the gut microbiota to recover colonisation resistance 
can result in recurrence of infection. An unusual characteristic of C. difficile 
among gut bacteria is its ability to produce the bacteriostatic compound 
para-cresol (p-cresol) through fermentation of tyrosine. Here, we demonstrate 
that the ability of C. difficile to produce p-cresol in vitro provides a 
competitive advantage over gut bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
oxytoca and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Metabolic profiling of competitive 
co-cultures revealed that acetate, alanine, butyrate, isobutyrate, p-cresol and 
p-hydroxyphenylacetate were the main metabolites responsible for differentiating 
the parent strain C. difficile (630Δerm) from a defined mutant deficient in 
p-cresol production. Moreover, we show that the p-cresol mutant displays a 
fitness defect in a mouse relapse model of C. difficile infection (CDI). 
Analysis of the microbiome from this mouse model of CDI demonstrates that 
colonisation by the p-cresol mutant results in a distinctly altered intestinal 
microbiota, and metabolic profile, with a greater representation of 
Gammaproteobacteria, including the Pseudomonales and Enterobacteriales. We 
demonstrate that Gammaproteobacteria are susceptible to exogenous p-cresol in 
vitro and that there is a clear divide between bacterial Phyla and their 
susceptibility to p-cresol. In general, Gram-negative species were relatively 
sensitive to p-cresol, whereas Gram-positive species were more tolerant. This 
study demonstrates that production of p-cresol by C. difficile has an effect on 
the viability of intestinal bacteria as well as the major metabolites produced 
in vitro. These observations are upheld in a mouse model of CDI, in which 
p-cresol production affects the biodiversity of gut microbiota and faecal 
metabolite profiles, suggesting that p-cresol production contributes to C. 
difficile survival and pathogenesis.

The intestine of pigs harbors a mass of microorganisms which are essential for 
intestinal homeostasis and host health. Intestinal microbial disorders induce 
enteric inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, thereby causing adverse effects 
on the growth and health of pigs. In the human medicine, fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT), which engrafts the fecal microbiota from a healthy donor 
into a patient recipient, has shown efficacy in intestinal microbiota 
restoration. In addition, it has been used widely in therapy for human 
gastrointestinal diseases, including Clostridium difficile infection, 
inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome. Given that pigs share 
many similarities with humans, in terms of anatomy, nutritional physiology, and 
intestinal microbial compositions, FMT may also be used to restore the normal 
intestinal microbiota of pigs. However, feasible procedures for performing FMT 
in pigs remains unclear. Here, we summarize a standardized preparation for FMT 
in pigs by combining the standard methodology for human FMT with pig production. 
The key issues include the donor selection, fecal material preparation, fecal 
material transfer, stool bank establishment, and the safety for porcine FMT. 
Optimal donors should be selected to ensure the efficacy of porcine FMT and 
reduce the risks of transmitting infectious diseases to recipients during FMT. 
Preparing for fresh fecal material is highly recommended. Alternatively, frozen 
fecal suspension can also be prepared as an optimal choice because it is 
convenient and has similar efficacy. Oral administration of fecal suspension 
could be an optimal method for porcine fecal material transfer. Furthermore, the 
dilution ratio of fecal materials and the frequency of fecal material transfer 
could be adjusted according to practical situations in the pig industry. To meet 
the potential large-scale requirement in the pig industry, it is important to 
establish a stool bank to make porcine FMT readily available. Future studies 
should also focus on providing more robust safety data on FMT to improve the 
safety and tolerability of the recipient pigs. This standardized preparation for 
porcine FMT can facilitate the development of microbial targeted therapies and 
improve the intestinal health of pigs.

Infection with Clostridium difficile is one of the major causes of health care 
acquired diarrhea and colitis. Signaling though MyD88 downstream of TLRs is 
critical for initiating the early protective host response in mouse models of C. 
difficile infection (CDI). In the intestine, MyD88 is expressed in various 
tissues and cell types, such as the intestinal epithelium and mononuclear 
phagocytes (MNP), including DC or macrophages. Using a genetic gain-of-function 
system, we demonstrate here that restricting functional MyD88 signaling to the 
intestinal epithelium, but also to MNPs is sufficient to protect mice during 
acute CDI by upregulation of the intestinal barrier function and recruitment of 
neutrophils. Nevertheless, we also show that mice depleted for CD11c-expressing 
MNPs in the intestine display no major defects in mounting an effective 
inflammatory response, indicating that the absence of these cells is irrelevant 
for inducing host protection during acute infection. Together, our results 
highlight the importance of epithelial-specific MyD88 signaling and demonstrate 
that although functional MyD88 signaling in DC and macrophages alone is 
sufficient to correct the phenotype of MyD88-deficiency, these cells do not seem

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) can 
result from the disruption of the resident gut microbiota. Western diets and 
popular weight-loss diets drive large changes in the gut microbiome; however, 
the literature is conflicted with regard to the effect of diet on CDI. Using the 
hypervirulent strain C. difficile R20291 (RT027) in a mouse model of 
antibiotic-induced CDI, we assessed disease outcome and microbial community 
dynamics in mice fed two high-fat diets in comparison with a high-carbohydrate 
diet and a standard rodent diet. The two high-fat diets exacerbated CDI, with a 
high-fat/high-protein, Atkins-like diet leading to severe CDI and 100% mortality 
and a high-fat/low-protein, medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT)-like diet inducing 
highly variable CDI outcomes. In contrast, mice fed a high-carbohydrate diet 
were protected from CDI, despite the high levels of refined carbohydrate and low 
levels of fiber in the diet. A total of 28 members of the Lachnospiraceae and 
Ruminococcaceae decreased in abundance due to diet and/or antibiotic treatment; 
these organisms may compete with C. difficile for amino acids and protect 
healthy animals from CDI in the absence of antibiotics. Together, these data 
suggest that antibiotic treatment might lead to loss of C. difficile competitors 
and create a favorable environment for C. difficile proliferation and virulence 
with effects that are intensified by high-fat/high-protein diets; in contrast, 
high-carbohydrate diets might be protective regardless of the source of 
carbohydrate or of antibiotic-driven loss of C. difficile competitors.IMPORTANCE 
The role of Western and weight-loss diets with extreme macronutrient composition 
in the risk and progression of CDI is poorly understood. In a longitudinal 
study, we showed that a high-fat/high-protein, Atkins-type diet greatly 
exacerbated antibiotic-induced CDI, whereas a high-carbohydrate diet protected, 
despite the high monosaccharide and starch content. Our study results, 
therefore, suggest that popular high-fat/high-protein weight-loss diets may 
enhance CDI risk during antibiotic treatment, possibly due to the synergistic 
effects of a loss of the microorganisms that normally inhibit C. difficile 
overgrowth and an abundance of amino acids that promote C. difficile overgrowth. 
In contrast, a high-carbohydrate diet might be protective, despite reports on 
the recent evolution of enhanced carbohydrate metabolism in C. difficile.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming bacillus that usually causes 
gastrointestinal disorders in man and other animal species. Most of the strains 
isolated from animals are toxigenic being the virulent ribotype (RT) 078 
predominant in several animal species. Although C. difficile is pathogenic to 
both humans and animals, there is no direct evidence of zoonosis. Deep genome 
sequencing provides sufficient resolution to analyse which strains found in 
animals might be related to human pathogens. So far, there are only a few fully 
sequenced genomes of C. difficile strains isolated from domestic and wild 
animals. Using Illumina technology, we have sequenced the genome of three 
isolates; a strain isolated from the vagina of a sow (5754), one from rat 
(Rattus spp) intestinal content (RC10) and a third one isolated from 
environmental rat faeces (RF17). Both, rat and rat faeces were sampled in 
fattening pig farms. Our study reveals a close genetic relationship of two of 
these isolates with the virulent strain M120 (RT078) isolated from a human 
patient. The analysis of the sequences has revealed the presence of antibiotic 
resistance genes, mobile elements, including the transposon linked with 
virulence Tn6164, and the similarity of virulence factors between these isolates 
and human strains. This is the first study focused on the sequencing of 
C. difficile genomes obtained from wild animals like rats, which can be 
considered as potential reservoirs for humans and other animal species. This 
study can help to understand the genome composition and epidemiology of this 
bacterium species.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin B (TcdB) is as an inflammatory 
enterotoxin that accounts for manifestations of widespread healthcare-associated 
C. difficile infection, including colonic inflammation. The present work 
explored the molecular mechanism by which TcdB activates innate immunity and 
stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Fetal human colon epithelial cells 
(FHCs) were treated with recombinant TcdB protein. Cell growth inhibition and 
apoptosis were measured with Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-fluorescein 
isothiocyanate Apoptosis Detection Kit, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis 
was also performed. Inflammatory cytokine induction was determined with 
enzykeme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses. Protein expression was assessed by 
western blot analysis. Gene overexpression and knockdown were performed with 
lentiviral transduction. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 
used to examine gene expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation were implemented to explore transcriptional regulation. 
Mouse colon tissues were analyzed with hematoxylin and eosin staining. The 
results show that TcdB-induced cell growth and apoptosis and enhanced expression 
of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in FHCs. We identified protein 
phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1B (PPM1B) as the key mediator promoting the 
phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB p65, which accounted for the increase in 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. The findings demonstrate that PPM1B expression is 
directly regulated by the AKT/FOXO3 signaling pathway in FHCs. We confirmed the 
molecular mechanism with in vivo studies using a mouse model infected with C. 
difficile and treated with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling inhibitor. 
In conclusion, TcdB induces inflammation in human colon epithelial cells by 
regulating the AKT/FOXO3/PPM1B pathway.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, and major 
cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Related studies have identified numerous factors 
that influence virulence traits such as the production of the two primary 
toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), as well as sporulation, motility, and 
biofilm formation. However, multiple putative transcriptional regulators are 
reportedly encoded in the genome, and additional factors are likely involved in 
virulence regulation. Although the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) 
has been studied extensively in Gram-negative bacteria, little is known about 
its function in Gram-positive bacteria, although homologs have been identified 
in the genome. This study revealed that disruption of the lone lrp homolog in C. 
difficile decelerated growth under nutrient-limiting conditions, increased TcdA 
and TcdB production. Lrp was also found to negatively regulate sporulation while 
positively regulate swimming motility in strain R20291, but not in strain 630. 
The C. difficile Lrp appeared to function through transcriptional repression or 
activation. In addition, the lrp mutant was relatively virulent in a mouse model 
of infection. The results of this study collectively demonstrated that Lrp has 
broad regulatory function in C. difficile toxin expression, sporulation, 
motility, and pathogenesis.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is an anaerobic gram-positive pathogen that 
is the leading cause of nosocomial bacterial infection globally. C. difficile 
infection (CDI) typically occurs after ingestion of infectious spores by a 
patient that has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. While CDI is a 
toxin-mediated disease, transmission and pathogenesis are dependent on the 
ability to produce viable spores. These spores must become metabolically active 
(germinate) in order to cause disease. C. difficile spore germination occurs 
when spores encounter bile salts and other co-germinants within the small 
intestine, however, the germination signaling cascade is unclear. Here we 
describe a signaling role for Ca2+ during C. difficile spore germination and 
provide direct evidence that intestinal Ca2+ coordinates with bile salts to 
stimulate germination. Endogenous Ca2+ (released from within the spore) and a 
putative AAA+ ATPase, encoded by Cd630_32980, are both essential for 
taurocholate-glycine induced germination in the absence of exogenous Ca2+. 
However, environmental Ca2+ replaces glycine as a co-germinant and circumvents 
the need for endogenous Ca2+ fluxes. Cd630_32980 is dispensable for colonization 
in a murine model of C. difficile infection and ex vivo germination in mouse 
ileal contents. Calcium-depletion of the ileal contents prevented mutant spore 
germination and reduced WT spore germination by 90%, indicating that Ca2+ 
present within the gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in C. difficile 
germination, colonization, and pathogenesis. These data provide a biological 
mechanism that may explain why individuals with inefficient intestinal calcium 
absorption (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, proton pump inhibitor use) are more 
prone to CDI and suggest that modulating free intestinal calcium is a potential 
strategy to curb the incidence of CDI.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major public health threat worldwide. 
The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with 
enhanced susceptibility to and severity of CDI; however, the mechanisms driving 
this phenomenon have not been elucidated. NSAIDs alter prostaglandin (PG) 
metabolism by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Here, we found that 
treatment with the NSAID indomethacin prior to infection altered the microbiota 
and dramatically increased mortality and the intestinal pathology associated 
with CDI in mice. We demonstrated that in C. difficile-infected animals, 
indomethacin treatment led to PG deregulation, an altered proinflammatory 
transcriptional and protein profile, and perturbed epithelial cell junctions. 
These effects were paralleled by increased recruitment of intestinal neutrophils 
and CD4+ cells and also by a perturbation of the gut microbiota. Together, these 
data implicate NSAIDs in the disruption of protective COX-mediated PG production 
during CDI, resulting in altered epithelial integrity and associated immune 
responses.IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a spore-forming 
anaerobic bacterium and leading cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. 
Epidemiological data suggest that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) increases the risk for CDI in humans, a potentially important 
observation given the widespread use of NSAIDs. Prior studies in rodent models 
of CDI found that NSAID exposure following infection increases the severity of 
CDI, but mechanisms to explain this are lacking. Here we present new data from a 
mouse model of antibiotic-associated CDI suggesting that brief NSAID exposure 
prior to CDI increases the severity of the infectious colitis. These data shed 
new light on potential mechanisms linking NSAID use to worsened CDI, including 
drug-induced disturbances to the gut microbiome and colonic epithelial 
integrity. Studies were limited to a single NSAID (indomethacin), so future 
studies are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings and to 
establish a direct link to the human condition.

Clostridium difficile is a gram positive, spore forming, toxin producing, 
anaerobic bacteria and an opportunistic pathogen for Man and many animal 
species, causing diarrhea in young piglets. Piglets probably become colonized 
from the environment. To investigate the possible spread and transmission of C. 
difficile by vermin, vermin samples were collected on a pig farm in the 
Netherlands and investigated for the presence of C. difficile. Samples of house 
mice (n=53), drain flies (n=39), lesser houseflies (n=95), and yellow mealworms 
(n=11) were found positive for C. difficile in 66%, 97%, 56% and 100% of cases 
respectively. C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 was found in all categories of 
vermin and ribotype 045 was found in two samples from the skeletal muscle of 
mice. House sparrows found dead on the premises (n=35) and bird droppings (n=26) 
were also investigated and carried C. difficile in 66% and 4% of cases 
respectively. PCR ribotype 078 was identified in bird and droppings samples but 
ribotype 045 was not. We conclude that vermin can play a role in the spread and 
transmission of C. difficile types 078 and 045 within pig farms and to other 
locations.

Although an association between clostridial pathogens and canine idiopathic 
acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) has been described, the relevance 
of those bacteria and their toxins remains unclear. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the association between severity of clinical signs and presence of 
Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile toxin A/B 
(CDT A/B) in faeces of dogs with AHDS. Faecal samples of 54 dogs with idiopathic 
AHDS were tested by qualitative CPE and CDT A/B ELISA, and PCR was performed to 
detect enterotoxin genes of C. perfringens (cpe) and toxin B genes of C. 
difficile (cdt b). Prevalence of cdt b and CDT A/B in dogs with AHDS was 10/54 
and 2/54 versus 3/23 and 0/23 in control dogs. Prevalence of cpe was 35/54 in 
affected versus 9/23 in control dogs. Prevalence of CPE in dogs with AHDS 
(13/54) was higher compared with control dogs (0/23). No significant difference 
was detected between CPE-positive and -negative and between cpe-positive and 
-negative dogs in severity of clinical signs, duration of hospitalisation, 
mortality rate and selected laboratory parameters. This study suggests that CPE 
and CDT A/B do not play a role in idiopathic AHDS, are not associated with 
clinical parameters in affected dogs and cannot be used to predict disease 
outcome.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in humans. 
Pet animals and livestock are discussed as potential natural reservoirs and 
sources of infection. In this study faecal samples from dogs and cats were 
collected at 10 animal shelters in Thuringia, Germany. C. difficile was isolated 
from 9 out of 165 (5.5%) canine and 5 out of 135 (3.7%) feline samples. Five PCR 
ribotypes (010, 014/020, 039, 045, SLO 066) were identified. PCR ribotypes 010 
and 014/020 were detected in more than one shelter and PCR ribotypes 014/020 and 
045 were isolated from dogs and cats. MLVA profiles of strains of a PCR ribotype 
from one shelter were identical or closely related, while strains of the same 
PCR ribotype from different shelters showed significant differences. This study 
shows that dogs and cats kept in animal shelters are a reservoir of C. difficile 
PCR ribotypes which can infect also humans.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is now widely used to treat recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection, but has been less studied as a means to restore 
microbiome diversity and composition following antibiotic or chemotherapy 
treatments. The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy of FMT to 
reverse antibiotic- and chemotherapy-induced gut dysbiosis in a mouse model. 
C57BL/6J mice were treated with ampicillin for 1 week and/or received a single 
intraperitoneal injection of 5-Fluorouracil. Fresh stool was collected and 
analyzed using shotgun metagenomics and the Illumina sequencing platform. 
Ampicillin caused a significant and immediate decrease in bacterial species 
richness and diversity that persisted for one week. In mice that received FMT, 
disruption of the intestinal microbiota was reversed immediately. Antibiotic and 
chemotherapy administration caused significant alteration in species 
distribution, including a decrease in the relative proportions of Clostridium 
scindens and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and an increase in known pathogenic 
species. In mice receiving FMT, we observed a significant increase in species 
known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, chemotherapy led to a 
critical decrease in key 'health-promoting' species and to an altered functional 
profile, especially when chemotherapy was administered in tandem with 
antibiotics, and that FMT can ameliorate these effects.

Susceptibility to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is primarily associated 
with previous exposure to antibiotics, which compromise the structure and 
function of the gut bacterial community. Specific antibiotic classes correlate 
more strongly with recurrent or persistent C. difficile infection. As such, we 
utilized a mouse model of infection to explore the effect of distinct antibiotic 
classes on the impact that infection has on community-level transcription and 
metabolic signatures shortly following pathogen colonization and how those 
changes may associate with persistence of C. difficile Untargeted metabolomic 
analysis revealed that C. difficile infection had significantly larger impacts 
on the metabolic environment across cefoperazone- and streptomycin-pretreated 
mice, which became persistently colonized compared to clindamycin-pretreated 
mice, where infection quickly became undetectable. Through metagenome-enabled 
metatranscriptomics, we observed that transcripts for genes associated with 
carbon and energy acquisition were greatly reduced in infected animals, 
suggesting that those niches were instead occupied by C. difficile Furthermore, 
the largest changes in transcription were seen in the least abundant species, 
indicating that C. difficile may "attack the loser" in gut environments where 
sustained infection occurs more readily. Overall, our results suggest that 
C. difficile is able to restructure the nutrient-niche landscape in the gut to 
promote persistent infection.IMPORTANCEClostridium difficile has become the most 
common single cause of hospital-acquired infection over the last decade in the 
United States. Colonization resistance to the nosocomial pathogen is primarily 
provided by the gut microbiota, which is also involved in clearing the infection 
as the community recovers from perturbation. As distinct antibiotics are 
associated with different risk levels for CDI, we utilized a mouse model of 
infection with 3 separate antibiotic pretreatment regimens to generate 
alternative gut microbiomes that each allowed for C. difficile colonization but 
varied in clearance rate. To assess community-level dynamics, we implemented an 
integrative multi-omics approach that revealed that infection significantly 
changed many aspects of the gut community. The degree to which the community 
changed was inversely correlated with clearance during the first 6 days of 
infection, suggesting that C. difficile differentially modifies the gut 
environment to promote persistence. This is the first time that 
metagenome-enabled metatranscriptomics have been employed to study the behavior 
of a host-associated microbiota in response to an infection. Our results allow 
for a previously unseen understanding of the ecology associated with 
C. difficile infection and provide the groundwork for identification of 
context-specific probiotic therapies.

Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that causes colitis 
in patients with disrupted colonic microbiota. While some individuals are 
asymptomatic C. difficile carriers, symptomatic disease ranges from mild 
diarrhea to potentially lethal toxic megacolon. The wide disease spectrum has 
been attributed to the infected host's age, underlying diseases, immune status, 
and microbiome composition. However, strain-specific differences in C. difficile 
virulence have also been implicated in determining colitis severity. Because 
patients infected with C. difficile are unique in terms of medical history, 
microbiome composition, and immune competence, determining the relative 
contribution of C. difficile virulence to disease severity has been challenging, 
and conclusions regarding the virulence of specific strains have been 
inconsistent. To address this, we used a mouse model to test 33 clinical 
C. difficile strains isolated from patients with disease severities ranging from 
asymptomatic carriage to severe colitis, and we determined their relative in 
vivo virulence in genetically identical, antibiotic-pretreated mice. We found 
that murine infections with C. difficile clade 2 strains (including multilocus 
sequence type 1/ribotype 027) were associated with higher lethality and that 
C. difficile strains associated with greater human disease severity caused more 
severe disease in mice. While toxin production was not strongly correlated with 
in vivo colonic pathology, the ability of C. difficile strains to grow in the 
presence of secondary bile acids was associated with greater disease severity. 
Whole-genome sequencing and identification of core and accessory genes 
identified a subset of accessory genes that distinguish high-virulence from 
lower-virulence C. difficile strains.IMPORTANCEClostridium difficile is an 
important cause of hospital-associated intestinal infections, and recent years 
have seen an increase in the number and severity of cases in the United States. 
A patient's antibiotic history, immune status, and medical comorbidities 
determine, in part, the severity of C. difficile infection. The relative 
virulence of different clinical C. difficile strains, although postulated to 
determine disease severity in patients, has been more difficult to consistently 
associate with mild versus severe colitis. We tested 33 distinct clinical 
C. difficile isolates for their ability to cause disease in genetically 
identical mice and found that C. difficile strains belonging to clade 2 were 
associated with higher mortality. Differences in survival were not attributed to 
differences in toxin production but likely resulted from the distinct gene 
content in the various clinical isolates.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) causes diarrhea and colitis. 
We aimed to find a common pathogenic pathway in CDI among humans and mice by 
comparing toxin-mediated effects in human and mouse colonic tissues.
METHOD: Using multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the 
cytokine secretion of toxin A- and B-treated human and mouse colonic explants.
RESULTS: Toxin A and toxin B exposure to fresh human and mouse colonic explants 
caused different patterns of cytokine secretion. Toxin A induced macrophage 
inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α secretion in both human and mouse explants. Toxin 
A reduced the expression of chloride anion exchanger SLC26A3 expression in mouse 
colonic explants and human colonic epithelial cells. Patients with CDI had 
increased colonic MIP-1 α expression and reduced colonic SLC26A3 (solute carrier 
family 26, member 3) compared with controls. Anti-MIP-1 α neutralizing antibody 
prevented death, ameliorated colonic injury, reduced colonic interleukin 1β 
(IL-1β) messenger RNA expression, and restored colonic SLC26a3 expression in C. 
difficile-infected mice. The anti-MIP-1 α neutralizing antibody prevented CDI 
recurrence. SLC26a3 inhibition augmented colonic IL-1 β messenger RNA expression 
and abolished the protective effect of anti-MIP-1 α neutralizing antibody in 
mice with CDI.
CONCLUSION: MIP-1 α is a common toxin A-dependent chemokine in human and mouse 
colon. MIP-1 α mediates detrimental effects by reducing SLC26a3 and enhancing 
IL-1 β expression in the colon.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic human 
gastrointestinal pathogen. C. difficile infection (CDI) is a major health 
concern worldwide, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous 
colitis, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and death. CDI onset and progression are 
mostly caused by intestinal dysbiosis and exposure to C. difficile spores. 
Current treatment strategies include antibiotics; however, antibiotic use is 
often associated with high recurrence rates and an increased risk of antibiotic 
resistance. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have been revealed to inhibit the 
growth of multiple human bacterial pathogens. Components of coconut oil, which 
include lauric acid, have been revealed to inhibit C. difficile growth in vitro. 
In this study, we demonstrated that lauric acid exhibits potent antimicrobial 
activities against multiple toxigenic C. difficile isolates in vitro. The 
inhibitory effect of lauric acid is partly due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation and cell membrane damage. The administration of lauric acid 
considerably reduced biofilm formation and preformed biofilms in a 
dose-dependent manner. Importantly, in a mouse infection model, lauric acid 
pretreatment reduced CDI symptoms and proinflammatory cytokine production. Our 
combined results suggest that the naturally occurring MCFA lauric acid is a 
novel C. difficile inhibitor and is useful in the development of an alternative 
or adjunctive treatment for CDI.

The carriage of two important pathogens of pigs, that is enterotoxigenic 
Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Clostridioides difficile, was investigated in 104 
cloacal samples from wild griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) fed on pig carcasses at 
supplementary feeding stations (SFS), along with their level of antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR). E. coli was isolated from 90 (86.5%) samples, but no ETEC was 
detected, likely because ETEC fimbriae confer the species specificity of the 
pathogen. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent was detected in 89.9% 
of E. coli isolates, with AMR levels being extremely high (>70%) for 
tetracycline and streptomycin and very high (>50%) for ampicillin and 
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Resistance to other critically important 
antimicrobials such as colistin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins was 2.2% 
and 1.1%, respectively, and was encoded by the mcr-1 and blaSHV-12 genes. 
Multidrug resistance was displayed by 80% of the resistant E. coli, and 
blaSHV-12 gene shared plasmid with other AMR genes. In general, resistance 
patterns in E. coli from vultures mirrored those found in pigs. Clostridioides 
difficile was detected in three samples (2.9%); two of them belonged to PCR 
ribotype 078 and one to PCR ribotype 126, both commonly found in pigs. All 
C. difficile isolates were characterized by a moderate-to-high level of 
resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides but susceptible to metronidazole 
or vancomycin, similar to what is usually found in C. difficile isolates from 
pigs. Thus, vultures may contribute somewhat to the environmental dissemination 
of some pig pathogens through their acquisition from pig carcasses and, more 
importantly, of AMR for antibiotics of critical importance for humans. However, 
the role of vultures would likely be much lesser than that of disposing pig 
carcasses at the SFS. The monitoring of AMR, and particularly of 
colistin-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli, should be considered in pig farms 
used as sources of carcasses for SFS.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming enteric 
pathogen that is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality and 
consequently poses an urgent threat to public health. Recurrence of a C. 
difficile infection (CDI) after successful treatment with antibiotics is high, 
occurring in 20-30% of patients, thus necessitating the discovery of novel 
therapeutics against this pathogen. Current animal models of CDI result in high 
mortality rates and thus do not approximate the chronic, insidious disease 
manifestations seen in humans with CDI. To evaluate therapeutics against C. 
difficile, a mouse model approximating human disease utilizing a 
clinically-relevant strain is needed. This protocol outlines the cefoperazone 
mouse model of CDI using a clinically-relevant and genetically-tractable strain, 
R20291. Techniques for clinical disease monitoring, C. difficile bacterial 
enumeration, toxin cytotoxicity, and histopathological changes throughout CDI in 
a mouse model are detailed in the protocol. Compared to other mouse models of 
CDI, this model is not uniformly lethal at the dose administered, allowing for 
the observation of a prolonged clinical course of infection concordant with the 
human disease. Therefore, this cefoperazone mouse model of CDI proves a valuable 
experimental platform to assess the effects of novel therapeutics on the 
amelioration of clinical disease and on the restoration of colonization 
resistance against C. difficile.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome (GMB) generates numerous chemicals that are 
absorbed systemically and excreted in urine. Antibiotics can disrupt the GMB 
ecosystem and weaken its resistance to colonization by enteric pathogens such as 
Clostridium difficile. If the changes in GMB composition and metabolism are 
sufficiently large, they can be reflected in the urinary metabo-lome. 
Characterizing these changes could provide a potentially valuable biomarker of 
the status of the GMB. While preliminary studies suggest such a possibility, the 
high level of data variance presents a challenge to translational applications. 
Since many GMB-generated chemicals are derived from the biotransformation of 
plant-derived dietary polyphenols, administering an oral precursor challenge 
should amplify GMB-dependent changes in urinary metabolites.
METHODS: A course of antibiotics (clindamycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or 
aztreonam) was administered SC daily (days 1 and 2) to mice receiving 
polyphenol-rich green tea in drinking water. Urine was collected at baseline as 
well as days 3, 7, and 11. Levels of pyrogallol and pyrocatechol, two phenolic 
molecules unequivocally GMB-dependent in humans but that had not been similarly 
examined in mice, were quantified.
RESULTS: In confirmation of our hypothesis, differential changes in murine 
urinary pyrogallol levels identified the treatments (clindamycin, 
piperacillin/tazobactam) previously associated with a weakening of colonization 
resistance to Clostridium difficile. The changes in pyrocatechol levels did not 
withstand corrections for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: In the mouse, urinary pyrogallol and, in all likelihood, 
pyrocatechol levels, are GMB-dependent and, in combination with precursor 
challenge, deserve further consideration as potential metabolomic biomarkers for 
the health and dysbiotic vulnerability of the GMB.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a serious threat for an 
aging population. Using an aged mouse model, we evaluated the effect of age and 
the roles of innate immunity and intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: Aged (18 months) and young (8 weeks) mice were infected with C 
difficile, and disease severity, immune response, and intestinal microbiome were 
compared. The same experiment was repeated with intestinal microbiota exchange 
between aged and young mice before infection.
RESULTS: Higher mortality was observed in aged mice with weaker neutrophilic 
mobilization in blood and intestinal tissue and depressed proinflammatory 
cytokines in early infection. Microbiota exchange improved survival and early 
immune response in aged mice. Microbiome analysis revealed that aged mice have 
significant deficiencies in Bacteroidetes phylum and, specifically, Bacteroides, 
Alistipes, and rc4-4 genera, which were replenished by cage switching.
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota-dependent alteration in innate immune response early on 
during infection may explain poor outcome in aged host with CDI.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is considered to be the major cause of the 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in animals and 
humans. The prevalence of C. difficile infections (CDI) has been increasing 
since 2000. Two exotoxins of C. difficile, Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), 
are the main virulence factors of CDI, which can induce glucosylation of Rho 
GTPases in host cytosol, leading to cell morphological changes, cell apoptosis, 
and cell death. The mechanism of TcdB-induced cell death has been investigated 
for decades, but it is still not completely understood. It has been reported 
that TcdB induces endoplasmic reticulum stress via PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway 
in CT26 cell line (BALB/C mouse colon tumor cells). In this study, we found that 
salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, efficiently 
protects CT26 cell line against TcdB-induced cell death and tried to explore the 
mechanism underlying in this protective effect. Our results demonstrated that 
salubrinal protects CT26 cells from TcdB-mediated cytotoxic and cytopathic 
effect, inhibits apoptosis and death of the toxin-exposed cells via 
caspase-9-dependent pathway, eIF2α signaling pathway, and autophagy. These 
findings will be helpful for the development of CDI therapies.

In this prospective study, feces of dogs with diarrhea were compared with feces 
of normal dogs for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C difficile toxins A 
and B, C perfringens, and C perfingens enterotoxin (CPE). C difficile toxins A, 
B, or both were present in feces of 18 of 87 (21%) dogs with diarrhea and 4 of 
55 (7%) normal dogs (P = 0.03), whereas CPE was present in the feces of 24 of 87 
(28%) dogs with diarrhea and 3 of 55 (5%) normal dogs (P = 0.01). C difficile 
was isolated from 2 of 87 (2%) dogs with diarrhea but was not isolated from the 
feces of 55 normal dogs, possibly because of poor survival of the organism in 
fecal samples. C perfringens was isolated from the feces of 23 of 24 (96%) 
CPE-positive dogs with diarrhea, 52 of 63 (83%) CPE-negative dogs with diarrhea, 
and 39 of 55 (71%) CPE-negative dogs with normal feces. No correlation was found 
between C perfringens spore number and the presence of CPE.

Clostridium difficile toxin B (cdtB) is a critical virulence factor 
characterized with potential cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory activity. This 
study aims to investigate anti-tumor effects of cdtB on breast cancer 
development. Clostridium difficile strain was cultured and cdtB recombinant 
protein (rcdtB) was synthesized. Breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was 
divided into Normal control, rcdtB 50, 100, 200 and 400 ng/ml group in vitro. 
Mice were divided into Normal control and rcdtB treatment group (400 ng/ml) in 
vivo. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) 
assay was performed to evaluate inhibitive effects of rcdtB on cell growth. Flow 
cytometry and transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end 
labeling (TUNEL) were employed to examine apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, 
respectively. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by utilizing commercial kit. 
B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were examined 
using western blot. Inflammatory response was detected using haematoxylin and 
eosin (HE). Erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (C-erbB-2) and 
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were examined using immunohistochemical and 
immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The results indicated that rcdtB 
significantly induced MDA-MB-231 death, inhibited growth and decreased S-phase 
cells compared to Normal control group (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly induced 
early and late apoptosis, and decreased Bcl-2 levels compared to Normal control 
group (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly inhibited cell migration compared to 
Normal control group (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly inhibited tumor growth and 
activated inflammation of breast cancer model compared to Normal control group 
(P < 0.01). rcdtB significantly reduced C-erbB-2 and Cox-2 in tumor tissues 
compared to Normal control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, rcdtB treatment 
inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis through inhibiting Bcl-2 
expression, inflammatory responses, and activating C-erbB-2 and Cox-2 expression 
in breast cancer mouse model.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has been associated with microbiota alterations 
and susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) in humans. We 
assessed how PPI treatment alters the fecal microbiota and whether treatment 
promotes CDIs in a mouse model. Mice receiving a PPI treatment were gavaged with 
40 mg of omeprazole per kg of body weight during a 7-day pretreatment phase, the 
day of C. difficile challenge, and the following 9 days. We found that mice 
treated with omeprazole were not colonized by C. difficile When omeprazole 
treatment was combined with a single clindamycin treatment, one cage of mice 
remained resistant to C. difficile colonization, while the other cage was 
colonized. Treating mice with only clindamycin followed by challenge resulted in 
C. difficile colonization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that 
omeprazole had minimal impact on the structure of the murine microbiota 
throughout the 16 days of omeprazole exposure. These results suggest that 
omeprazole treatment alone is not sufficient to disrupt microbiota resistance to 
C. difficile infection in mice that are normally resistant in the absence of 
antibiotic treatment.IMPORTANCE Antibiotics are the primary risk factor for 
Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs), but other factors may also increase 
a person's risk. In epidemiological studies, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has 
been associated with CDI incidence and recurrence. PPIs have also been 
associated with alterations in the human intestinal microbiota in observational 
and interventional studies. We evaluated the effects of the PPI omeprazole on 
the structure of the murine intestinal microbiota and its ability to disrupt 
colonization resistance to C. difficile We found omeprazole treatment had 
minimal impact on the murine fecal microbiota and did not promote C. difficile 
colonization. Further studies are needed to determine whether other factors 
contribute to the association between PPIs and CDIs seen in humans or whether 
aspects of murine physiology may limit its utility to test these types of 
hypotheses.

Different studies have suggested that the sand of public playgrounds could have 
a role in the transmission of infections, particularly in children. Furthermore, 
free access of pets and other animals to the playgrounds might increase such a 
risk. We studied the presence of Clostridium difficile in 20 pairs of sandboxes 
for children and dogs located in different playgrounds within the Madrid region 
(Spain). Clostridium difficile isolation was performed by enrichment and 
selective culture procedures. The genetic (ribotype and amplified fragment 
length polymorphism [AFLP]) diversity and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates 
was also studied. Overall, 52.5% (21/40) of samples were positive for the 
presence of C. difficile. Eight of the 20 available isolates belonged to the 
toxigenic ribotypes 014 (n = 5) and 106 (n = 2), both regarded as epidemic, and 
CD047 (n = 1). The other 12 isolates were non-toxigenic, and belonged to 
ribotypes 009 (n = 5), 039 (n = 4), and 067, 151 and CD048 (one isolate each). 
Nevertheless, all isolates (even those of a same ribotype) were classified into 
different AFLP genotypes indicating non-relatedness. In conclusion, our results 
revealed the presence of epidemic ribotypes of C. difficile in children's and 
dog's sandboxes located nearby, which constitutes a major health risk.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) causes nosocomial/antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, with dramatic incidence/mortality 
worldwide. C. difficile virulence factors are toxin A and toxin B (TcdB) which 
cause cytopathic/cytotoxic effects and inflammation. Until now studies were 
focused on molecular effects of C. difficile toxins (Tcds) on different cells 
while unexplored aspect is the status/fate of cells that survived their 
cytotoxicity. Recently we demonstrated that enteric glial cells (EGCs) are 
susceptible to TcdB cytotoxicity, but several EGCs survived and were 
irreversibly cell-cycle arrested and metabolically active, suggesting that EGCs 
could became senescent. This is important because allowed us to evaluate the not 
explored status/fate of cells surviving Tcds cytotoxicity, and particularly if 
TcdB induces senescence in EGCs. Rat-transformed EGCs were treated with 10 ng/ml 
TcdB for 6 h-48 h, or for 48 h, followed by incubation for additional 4 or 
11 days in absence of TcdB (6 or 13 total days). Senescence markers/effectors 
were examined by specific assays. TcdB induces senescence in EGCs, as 
demonstrated by the senescence markers: irreversible cell-cycle arrest, 
senescence-associated-β‑galactosidase positivity, flat morphology, early and 
persistent DNA damage (ATM and H2AX phosphorylation), p27 overexpression, pRB 
hypophosphorylation, c‑Myc, cyclin B1, cdc2 and phosphorylated-cdc2 
downregulation, Sirtuin‑2 and Sirtuin‑3 overexpression. TcdB-induced EGC 
senescence is dependent by JNK and AKT activation but independent by ROS, p16 
and p53/p21 pathways. In conclusion, TcdB induces senescence in EGCs. The 
extrapolation of these results to CDI leads to hypothesize that EGCs that 
survived TcdB, once they have acquired a senescence state, could cause irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and tumors due to 
persistent inflammation, transfer of senescence status and stimulation of 
pre-neoplastic cells.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile (CD) infection (CDI) increases patient 
morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Antibiotic treatment induces gut 
dysbiosis and is both a major risk factor for CD colonization and treatment of 
CDI. Probiotics have been trialed to support commensal gut microbiota and reduce 
CDI. This study investigated commensal microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (FP) 
and a prebiotic, both known to yield butyrate and be anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory, on CD colonization and gut integrity in mice.
METHODS: Mice were randomly grouped and supplemented daily with FP, prebiotic, 
FP + prebiotic, FP/prebiotic supernatant, or saline throughout the entire study. 
Following treatment with clindamycin for 3 days, mice were exposed to CD. Feces 
were collected at baseline, the day after antibiotic, and 1, 3, and 5 days after 
CD exposure and cultured for bacterial overgrowth and CD colonization. On days 1 
and 5 after CD exposure, mice were randomly euthanized, and proximal colon was 
dissected for histological analysis and preparation of RNA for analysis of 
proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
RESULTS: Although all mice exhibited bacterial overgrowth and CD colonization, 
bacterial burden resolved quicker in the FP + prebiotic group. This was 
associated with induction and resolution of innate immune responses, anion 
exchanger, and tight junction protein preservation in proximal colon. CD toxin 
virulence potential was questionable as expression of CD toxin B receptor was 
depleted in the FP + prebiotic group.
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with anti-inflammatory butyrate-supporting commensal 
bacteria and prebiotic may support innate immune responses and minimize 
bacterial burden and negative effects during antibiotic and CD exposure.

A variety of bacteria are known or suspected of being able to cause enteritis in 
dogs and cats. Campylobacter spp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium 
perfringens, and Salmonella spp are most commonly implicated, but many other 
organisms are likely involved. Poor understanding of the intestinal microflora 
and the fact that many, if not all, of these microorganisms can also be found in 
healthy individuals complicates testing, thereby affecting the use of specific 
treatments and assessment of potential infection control and zoonotic disease 
risks. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic 
options is important for the management of canine and feline enteritis.

This study investigated the effect of carvacrol (CR), a phytophenolic compound 
on antibiotic-associated gut dysbiosis and C. difficile infection in a mouse 
model. Five to six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into seven 
treatment groups (challenge and control) of eight mice each. Mice were fed with 
irradiated feed supplemented with CR (0, 0.05, and 0.1%); the challenge groups 
were made susceptible to C. difficile by orally administering an antibiotic 
cocktail in water and an intra-peritoneal injection of clindamycin. Both 
challenge and control groups were infected with 105CFU/ml of hypervirulent C. 
difficile (ATCC 1870) spores or PBS, and observed for clinical signs for 10 
days. Respective control groups for CR, antibiotics, and their combination were 
included for investigating their effect on mouse enteric microflora. Mouse body 
weight and clinical and diarrhea scores were recorded daily post infection. 
Fecal samples were collected for microbiome analysis using rRNA sequencing in 
MiSeq platform. Carvacrol supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of 
diarrhea and improved the clinical and diarrhea scores in mice (p < 0.05). 
Microbiome analysis revealed a significant increase in Proteobacteria and 
reduction in the abundance of protective bacterial flora in antibiotic-treated 
and C. difficile-infected mice compared to controls (p < 0.05). However, CR 
supplementation positively altered the microbiome composition, as revealed by an 
increased abundance of beneficial bacteria, including Firmicutes, and 
significantly reduced the proportion of detrimental flora such as 
Proteobacteria, without significantly affecting the gut microbiome diversity 
compared to control. Results suggest that CR could potentially be used to 
control gut dysbiosis and reduce C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of health care-associated 
disease. CDI initiates with ingestion of C. difficile spores, germination in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and then colonization of the large intestine. The 
interactions between C. difficile cells and other bacteria and with host mucosa 
during CDI remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed the hypothesis that, in 
a mouse model of CDI, C. difficile resides in multicellular communities 
(biofilms) in association with host mucosa. To do this, we paraffin embedded and 
then sectioned the GI tracts of infected mice at various days postinfection 
(p.i.). We then used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with 16S rRNA 
probes targeting most bacteria as well as C. difficile specifically. The results 
revealed that C. difficile is present as a minority member of communities in the 
outer (loose) mucus layer, in the cecum and colon, starting at day 1 p.i. To 
generate FISH probes that identify bacteria within mucus-associated communities 
harboring C. difficile, we characterized bacterial populations in the infected 
mouse GI tract using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of bacterial DNA prepared 
from intestinal content. This analysis revealed the presence of genera of 
several families belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. These data suggest 
that formation of multispecies communities associated with the mucus of the 
cecum and colon is an important early step in GI tract colonization. They raise 
the possibility that other bacterial species in these communities modulate the 
ability of C. difficile to successfully colonize and, thereby, cause disease.

A total of 1034 samples were collected from different sources and C. difficile 
was isolated from 18 (9.04%) of 199 human, 9 (4.89%) of 184 cattle, 29 (12.44%) 
of 233 pig, and from 23 (13.94%) of 165 poultry samples. Variations were 
observed on the rate of isolation according to age and clinical conditions 
(diarrhoea). None of the samples from cow, sheep, goat, local chicken, and wild 
animals yielded any C. difficile. Out of those isolates, 8, 2, 19 and 6 isolates 
from human, cattle, pig and poultry, respectively were toxigenic. The toxigenic 
isolates carried both tcdA, and tcdB (A+B+) and most of the human and the pig 
isolates were also positive for binary toxin genes (cdtA and cdtB). The A+B+ 
isolates belonged to three different toxinotypes (0, VI and XXXIII). Human and 
pig A+B+ isolates belonged to three (045, 126 and ACD 019) and four (046, 087, 
126 and ACD 011) different ribotypes, respectively and the ribotypes of two 
cattle isolates were 014 and ACD 010. Six A+B+ avian isolates belonged to six 
different ribotypes (014, 087, SLO 134, SLO 160, ACD 012, ACD 014). The 
non-toxigenic isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry were grouped into 7, 
4, 4 and 7 different ribotypes, respectively. PFGE analysis could not 
differentiate similar ribotypes/toxinotypes of toxigenic isolates. All the 
toxigenic isolates showed cytopathic effect on Vero and Hela cell monolayers at 
1:100 dilutions of cell-free culture supernatants within 18-20 h of inoculation.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Prompted by an article describing a dog trained to detect 
Clostridium difficile in patients, our institution evaluated a dog's ability to 
detect C. difficile scent from equipment and surfaces to assist in strategic 
deployment of adjunctive cleaning measures.
METHODS: An expert in drug and explosives scent dog handling trained a canine to 
identify odours from pure cultures and/or faecal specimens positive for 
C. difficile. Methods used to assess explosive and drug detection dogs were 
adapted and included evaluation of (i) odour recognition, using containers 
positive and negative for the scent of C. difficile, and of (ii) search 
capability, on a simulation ward with hidden scents. After demonstration that 
the canine could accurately and reliably detect the scent of C. difficile, 
formal assessments of all clinical areas began.
FINDINGS: Odour recognition (N = 75 containers) had a sensitivity of 100% and 
specificity of 97%. Search capability was 80% sensitive and 92.9% specific after 
removal of results from one room where dog and trainer fatigue influenced 
performance. Both odour recognition and search capability had an overall 
sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 95.4%. The clinical unit sweeps over a 
period of five months revealed a sensitivity of 100% in alerting on positive 
quality control hides. These clinical unit sweeps also resulted in 83 alerts 
during 49 sweep days.
CONCLUSION: A dog can be trained to accurately and reliably detect C. difficile 
odour from environmental sources to guide the best deployment of adjunctive 
cleaning measures and can be successfully integrated into a quality infection 
control programme.

The host immune response to Clostridium difficile infection.

Solomon K(1).

Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common infectious cause of 
healthcare-acquired diarrhoea. Outcomes of C. difficile colonization are varied, 
from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant colitis and death, due in part to the 
interplay between the pathogenic virulence factors of the bacterium and the 
counteractive immune responses of the host. Secreted toxins A and B are the 
major virulence factors of C. difficile and induce a profound inflammatory 
response by intoxicating intestinal epithelial cells causing proinflammatory 
cytokine release. Host cell necrosis, vascular permeability and neutrophil 
infiltration lead to an elevated white cell count, profuse diarrhoea and in 
severe cases, dehydration, hypoalbuminaemia and toxic megacolon. Other bacterial 
virulence factors, including surface layer proteins and flagella proteins, are 
detected by host cell surface signal molecules that trigger downstream 
cell-mediated immune pathways. Human studies have identified a role for serum 
and faecal immunoglobulin levels in protection from disease, but the recent 
development of a mouse model of CDI has enabled studies into the precise 
molecular interactions that trigger the immune response during infection. Key 
effector molecules have been identified that can drive towards a protective 
anti-inflammatory response or a damaging proinflammatory response. The 
limitations of current antimicrobial therapies for CDI have led to the 
development of both active and passive immunotherapies, none of which have, as 
yet been formally approved for CDI. However, recent advances in our 
understanding of the molecular basis of host immune protection against CDI may 
provide an exciting opportunity for novel therapeutic developments in the 
future.

Neonatal porcine diarrhea (NPD) is a current problem on pig farms and is caused 
by several enteropathogens. Among them, Clostridioides difficile stands out due 
to its importance in piglets and zoonotic potential. A non-toxigenic strain of 
C. difficile (NTCD), named Z31, was previously tested in hamster and piglet 
experimental models as a strategy to prevent C. difficile infection (CDI). To 
evaluate the capacity of the strain Z31 to prevent CDI and NPD in one-day-old 
piglets on a commercial farm, 90 piglets from 16 litters received 1 × 106 spores 
of Z31 while 84 animals from the same litters served as controls. Animals were 
clinically evaluated, and fecal samples were collected 24 h after administration 
and submitted to A/B toxin detection and isolation of C. difficile. Stool 
samples were also submitted to rotavirus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium 
perfringens detection. Administration of Z31 reduced the incidence of CDI in 
treated animals (7.8%) when compared to the control group (25.0%; P = 0.003). In 
animals that developed CDI, the intensity of diarrhea was lower in those that 
received Z31 than in the control group. Neonatal porcine diarrhea was reduced in 
treated animals when compared to untreated animals (P < 0.001). The present 
study suggests that Z31 can potentially be used to prevent CDI in piglets on 
commercial farms.

The increased incidence of antibiotic resistant 'superbugs' has amplified the 
use of broad spectrum antibiotics worldwide. An unintended consequence of 
antimicrobial treatment is disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, 
resulting in susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridium 
difficile. Paradoxically, treatment of C. difficile infections (CDI) also 
involves antibiotic use, leaving patients susceptible to re-infection. This 
serious health threat has led to an urgent call for the development of new 
therapeutics to reduce or replace the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial 
infections. To address this need, we have developed colostrum-derived antibodies 
for the prevention and treatment of CDI. Pregnant cows were immunised to 
generate hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC) containing antibodies that target 
essential C. difficile virulence components, specifically, spores, vegetative 
cells and toxin B (TcdB). Mouse infection and relapse models were used to 
compare the capacity of HBC to prevent or treat primary CDI as well as prevent 
recurrence. Administration of TcdB-specific colostrum alone, or in combination 
with spore or vegetative cell-targeted colostrum, prevents and treats C. 
difficile disease in mice and reduces disease recurrence by 67%. C. 
difficile-specific colostrum should be re-considered as an immunotherapeutic for 
the prevention or treatment of primary or recurrent CDI.

Recent studies suggest animals, in particular farm and companion animals, as 
possible reservoir for Clostridium difficile human pathogenic strains. The aim 
of this study was to give a first characterization of C. difficile isolates from 
Italian swine and dogs. In total, 10 different PCR-ribotypes were identified 
among porcine strains and six among canine strains. The predominant type found 
among porcine strains was 078 (50%), whereas the most frequently detected among 
canine strains was the non-toxinogenic 010 (64%). Considering the CLSI 
breakpoints, 60% of porcine isolates was resistant to ERY, 35% to MXF, 15% to 
CLI, 5% to RIF, and none to MTZ or VAN. Among dogs, 51% of strains was resistant 
to CLI, 46% to ERY, 21% to MTZ and 5% to MXF or RIF, and none to VAN. Five 
porcine strains (10%) and 9 canine isolates (41%) were MDR. Interestingly, 8 MDR 
canine strains were highly resistant to MTZ, with MICs ≥32 mg/L. Considering the 
EUCAST cut-off for MTZ (MIC >2 mg/L), 13 canine isolates and one porcine strain 
were found with reduced susceptibility to MTZ (MICs ranging from 3 to 
≥256 mg/L). Swine and canine strains showing resistance or reduced 
susceptibility to MTZ belonged to PCR-ribotype 010 and 078. These PCR-ribotypes 
have been associated to reduced susceptibility to MTZ also in human, suggesting 
a potential risk for the emergence of C. difficile strains resistant to the 
current first-line antibiotic for CDI treatment. The agar incorporation method 
(AIM) was confirmed as the best method to detect C. difficile strains with this 
phenotype also after strains manipulations. The results obtained add further 
evidences about the possible role of animals as source of MDR C. difficile 
strains and reservoir of antibiotic resistance determinants.

The objectives of this study were to examine the potential roles of Clostridium 
difficile and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens in diarrhea in dogs by 
comparison of isolation, determination of toxin status via enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and application of multiplex polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). These techniques were used to evaluate fecal specimens in 132 
healthy and diarrheic dogs. These dogs were prospectively evaluated by grouping 
them into the following 3 categories: hospitalized dogs with diarrhea (n = 32), 
hospitalized dogs without diarrhea (n = 42), and apparently healthy outpatient 
dogs without diarrhea (n = 58). All fecal specimens were cultured using 
selective media for C difficile, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. and 
selective media after heat shock for C perfringens. No significant difference 
was found in the isolation of C perfringens or C difficile among the 3 groups. A 
significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and detection 
of C perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) or toxin A via ELISA for both C perfringens 
and C difficile, respectively. PCR performed on C difficile isolates for toxin A 
and toxin B genes revealed no significant differences among the 3 groups, but 
diarrheic dogs were significantly more likely to be positive for the enterotoxin 
gene of C perfringens. Based on the results of this study, the use of ELISA for 
detection of CPE in feces combined with the detection of enterotoxigenic fecal 
isolates obtained via heat shock provides the strongest evidence for the 
presence of C perfringens-associated diarrhea.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common, debilitating infection with 
high morbidity and mortality. C. difficile causes diarrhea and intestinal 
inflammation by releasing two toxins, toxin A and toxin B. The macrolide 
antibiotic fidaxomicin was recently shown to be effective in treating CDI, and 
its beneficial effect was associated with fewer recurrent infections in CDI 
patients. Since other macrolides possess anti-inflammatory properties, we 
examined the possibility that fidaxomicin alters C. difficile toxin A-induced 
ileal inflammation in mice. The ileal loops of anesthetized mice were injected 
with fidaxomicin (5, 10, or 20 μM), and after 30 min, the loops were injected 
with purified C. difficile toxin A or phosphate-buffered saline alone. Four 
hours after toxin A administration, ileal tissues were processed for 
histological evaluation (epithelial cell damage, neutrophil infiltration, 
congestion, and edema) and cytokine measurements. C. difficile toxin A caused 
histologic damage, evidenced by increased mean histologic score and ileal 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) protein and mRNA expression. Treatment with fidaxomicin 
(20 μM) or its primary metabolite, OP-1118 (120 μM), significantly inhibited 
toxin A-mediated histologic damage and reduced the mean histology score and 
ileal IL-1β protein and mRNA expression. Both fidaxomicin and OP-1118 reduced 
toxin A-induced cell rounding in human colonic CCD-18Co fibroblasts. Treatment 
of ileal loops with vancomycin (20 μM) and metronidazole (20 μM) did not alter 
toxin A-induced histologic damage and IL-1β protein expression. In addition to 
its well known antibacterial effects against C. difficile, fidaxomicin may 
possess anti-inflammatory activity directed against the intestinal effects of C. 
difficile toxins.

In this paper we study antibiotic-induced C. difficile infection (CDI), caused 
by the toxin-producing C. difficile (CD), and implement clinically-inspired 
simulated treatments in a computational framework that synthesizes a generalized 
Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with SIR modeling techniques. The gLV model uses 
parameters derived from an experimental mouse model, in which the mice are 
administered antibiotics and subsequently dosed with CD. We numerically identify 
which of the experimentally measured initial conditions are vulnerable to CD 
colonization, then formalize the notion of CD susceptibility analytically. We 
simulate fecal transplantation, a clinically successful treatment for CDI, and 
discover that both the transplant timing and transplant donor are relevant to 
the the efficacy of the treatment, a result which has clinical implications. We 
incorporate two nongeneric yet dangerous attributes of CD into the gLV model, 
sporulation and antibiotic-resistant mutation, and for each identify relevant 
SIR techniques that describe the desired attribute. Finally, we rely on the 
results of our framework to analyze an experimental study of fecal transplants 
in mice, and are able to explain observed experimental results, validate our 
simulated results, and suggest model-motivated experiments.

Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen in humans with an 
increasing incidence in the community. The "one-health" approach of research is 
needed to investigate possible reservoirs of C. difficile and route of its 
transmission. The objective of this study is to investigate the occurrence of C. 
difficile in pigs in the Czech Republic with characterisation of the isolates to 
determine their genetic relatedness to C. difficile isolates from European and 
Asian pigs. A total of 198 pig faeces samples from 23 farms were investigated 
and of those 57 samples (55 piglets, 2 sows) from 11 farms were confirmed as C. 
difficile positive. The majority of C. difficile isolates belonged to the 
sequence type 11 and clade 5. The predominant ribotypes were 078 (n = 23), 
078-variant (n = 5), 033 (n = 10) followed by RTs 150 (n = 7), 011 (n = 5), 045 
(n = 4), 126, 014, 002 (n = 1, each). All isolates were susceptible to 
metronidazole, vancomycin and tetracycline. Isolates of RTs 150 and 078-variant 
were moxifloxacin resistant (MIC≥32 mg/L) and carried the amino acid 
substitution Thr82Ile in the GyrA. A multi-locus variable number tandem-repeats 
analysis (MLVA) revealed a clonal relatedness of isolates within individual 
farms and in C. difficile RT078 isolates between two Czech farms. Czech C. 
difficile RT078 isolates clustered with German C. difficile RT078 isolates and 
Czech C. difficile 078-variant isolates clustered with C. difficile RT078 
isolates from Japan and Taiwan. This study found an emergence of C. difficile 
RT078 in Czech piglets that was related genetically to C. difficile RT078 
isolates from Germany, Japan and Taiwan.

Clostridium difficile is an important spore-forming, opportunistic pathogen in 
animal husbandry and health care. In pig farming, only neonatal piglets are 
affected, and diarrhoea and necrotising lesions are common symptoms leading to 
dehydration and in some cases death. This study aimed at the assessment of the 
quantitative development of C. difficile colonisation in neonatal piglets by 
determining the shedding of spores and C. difficile toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) 
concentrations in sow (n = 5-6) and piglet pen faeces (n = 5-6) at different 
time points. Spores were quantified on selective agar plates and toxins using 
ELISA method. C. difficile was not detected in the faeces of all but one sow 
during the perinatal period. Faeces of 2- and 4-day-old piglets contained 
0.65 log cells/g and 5.88 log cells/g of C. difficile, respectively. Toxins were 
detected on day 4 at a concentration of 2.13 log ng/g (TcdA) and 2.06 log ng/g 
(TcdB). On day 6, concentration of C. difficile reached 6.14 log CFU/g and 
toxins 2.02 log ng/g (TcdA) and 2.20 log ng/g (TcdB). Two-week-old piglets 
showed 4.72 log CFU/g of C. difficile but toxins could not be detected. At 21 
days of age, both C. difficile and toxins were undetectable. The concentration 
and the prevalence of C. difficile were positively associated with the 
prevalence of toxins in piglets. A very short time window for colonisation by C. 
difficile, including toxin-producing strains can be observed in neonatal 
piglets. The significance for animal health and the risk of a carrier status 
need to be addressed in future studies.

The increasing clinical importance of human infections (frequently severe) 
caused by Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 (RT078) was first reported in 
2008. The severity of symptoms (mortality of ≤30%) and the higher proportion of 
infections among community and younger patients raised concerns. Farm animals, 
especially pigs, have been identified as RT078 reservoirs. We aimed to 
understand the recent changes in RT078 epidemiology by investigating a possible 
role for antimicrobial selection in its recent evolutionary history. 
Phylogenetic analysis of international RT078 genomes (isolates from 2006 to 
2014, n = 400), using time-scaled, recombination-corrected, maximum likelihood 
phylogenies, revealed several recent clonal expansions. A common ancestor of 
each expansion had independently acquired a different allele of the tetracycline 
resistance gene tetM Consequently, an unusually high proportion (76.5%) of RT078 
genomes were tetM positive. Multiple additional tetracycline resistance 
determinants were also identified (including efflux pump tet40), frequently 
sharing a high level of nucleotide sequence identity (up to 100%) with sequences 
found in the pig pathogen Streptococcus suis and in other zoonotic pathogens 
such as Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli Each RT078 tetM clonal 
expansion lacked geographic structure, indicating rapid, recent international 
spread. Resistance determinants for C. difficile infection-triggering 
antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones and clindamycin, were comparatively 
rare in RT078. Tetracyclines are used intensively in agriculture; this selective 
pressure, plus rapid, international spread via the food chain, may explain the 
increased RT078 prevalence in humans. Our work indicates that the use of 
antimicrobials outside the health care environment has selected for resistant 
organisms, and in the case of RT078, has contributed to the emergence of a human 
pathogen.IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 (RT078) has multiple 
reservoirs; many are agricultural. Since 2005, this genotype has been 
increasingly associated with human infections in both clinical settings and the 
community. Investigations of RT078 whole-genome sequences revealed that 
tetracycline resistance had been acquired on multiple independent occasions. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed a rapid, recent increase in numbers of closely 
related tetracycline-resistant RT078 (clonal expansions), suggesting that 
tetracycline selection has strongly influenced its recent evolutionary history. 
We demonstrate recent international spread of emergent, tetracycline-resistant 
RT078. A similar tetracycline-positive clonal expansion was also identified in 
unrelated nontoxigenic C. difficile, suggesting that this process may be 
widespread and may be independent of disease-causing ability. Resistance to 
typical C. difficile infection-associated antimicrobials (e.g., 
fluoroquinolones, clindamycin) occurred only sporadically within RT078. 
Selective pressure from tetracycline appears to be a key factor in the emergence 
of this human pathogen and the rapid international dissemination that followed, 
plausibly via the food chain.

Worldwide, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) carry a number of zoonotic pathogens. 
Many studies have identified rat-level risk factors for pathogen carriage. The 
objective of this study was to examine associations between abundance, 
microenvironmental and weather features and Clostridium difficile, 
antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage in urban rats. We assessed city blocks for 
rat abundance and 48 microenvironmental variables during a trap-removal study, 
then constructed 32 time-lagged temperature and precipitation variables and 
fitted multivariable logistic regression models. The odds of C. difficile 
positivity were significantly lower when mean maximum temperatures were high 
(≥ 12.89°C) approximately 3 months before rat capture. Alley pavement condition 
was significantly associated with AMR E. coli. Rats captured when precipitation 
was low (< 49.40 mm) in the 15 days before capture and those from blocks that 
contained food gardens and institutions had increased odds of testing positive 
for MRSA. Different factors were associated with each pathogen, which may 
reflect varying pathogen ecology including exposure and environmental survival. 
This study adds to the understanding of how the microenvironment and weather 
impacts the epidemiology and ecology of zoonotic pathogens in urban ecosystems, 
which may be useful for surveillance and control activities.

Clostridioides difficile toxin B (TcdB) is an intracellular toxin responsible 
for many of the pathologies of C. difficile infection. The two variant forms of 
TcdB (TcdB1 and TcdB2) share 92% sequence identity but have reported differences 
in rates of cell entry, autoprocessing, and overall toxicity. This 
2,366-amino-acid, multidomain bacterial toxin glucosylates and inactivates small 
GTPases in the cytosol of target cells, ultimately leading to cell death. 
Successful cell entry and intoxication by TcdB are known to involve various 
conformational changes in the protein, including a proteolytic autoprocessing 
event. Previous studies found that amino acids 1753 to 1852 influence the 
conformational states of the proximal carboxy-terminal domain of TcdB and could 
contribute to differences between TcdB1 and TcdB2. In the current study, a 
combination of approaches was used to identify sequences within the region from 
amino acids 1753 to 1852 that influence the conformational integrity and 
cytotoxicity of TcdB2. Four deletion mutants with reduced cytotoxicity were 
identified, while one mutant, TcdB2Δ1769-1787, exhibited no detectable 
cytotoxicity. TcdB2Δ1769-1787 underwent spontaneous autoprocessing and was 
unable to interact with CHO-K1 or HeLa cells, suggesting a potential change in 
the conformation of the mutant protein. Despite the putative alteration in 
structural stability, vaccination with TcdB2Δ1769-1787 induced a 
TcdB2-neutralizing antibody response and protected against C. difficile disease 
in a mouse model. These findings indicate that the 19-amino-acid region spanning 
residues 1769 to 1787 in TcdB2 is crucial to cytotoxicity and the structural 
regulation of autoprocessing and that TcdB2Δ1769-1787 is a promising candidate 
for vaccination.

Clostridium difficile causes infectious diarrhoea in humans and animals. It has 
been found in both diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal pigs, horses and cattle, 
suggesting a potential reservoir for human insection, and in 20-40 % of meat 
products in Canada and the USA, suggesting the possibility, albeit not proven, 
of food-borne transmission. Although it is not yet completely clear, it is 
likely that excessive antimicrobial exposure is driving the establishment of C. 
difficile in animals, in a manner analogous to human infection, rather than the 
organism just being normal flora of the animal gastrointestinal tract. PCR 
ribotype 078 is the most common ribotype of C. difficile found in pigs (83 % in 
one study in the USA) and cattle (up to 100 %) and this ribotype is now the 
third most common ribotype of C. difficile found in human infection in Europe. 
Human and pig strains of C. difficile are genetically identical in Europe 
confirming that a zoonosis exists. Rates of community-acquired C. difficile 
infection (CDI) are increasing world wide, a fact that sits well with the notion 
that animals are a reservoir for human infection. Thus, there are three problems 
that require resolution: a human health issue, an animal health issue and the 
factor common to both these problems, environmental contamination. To 
successfully deal with these recent changes in the epidemiology of CDI will 
require a 'one health' approach involving human health physicians, veterinarians 
and environmental scientists.

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of bacterial antibiotic-associated 
diarrhoea in hospitals in the developed world. Despite this notoriety, the 
complex mechanisms employed by this pathogen to overcome innate host defences 
and induce fulminant disease are poorly understood. Various animal models have 
been used extensively for C. difficile research to study disease pathogenesis. 
Until recently, the most commonly used C. difficile disease model has utilised 
hamsters; however, mouse and pig models have now been developed that unravel 
different aspects of C. difficile pathology. This review summarises key aspects 
of the small animal models currently used in C. difficile studies with a 
specific focus on major differences between them. Furthermore, this review 
highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each model and illustrates that 
careful consideration is required when selecting models for use in C. difficile 
research.

Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) have recently increased worldwide. Some 
CDI progress to fulminant and recurrent CDI and are associated with high 
mortality and morbidity. CD produces toxins A and B, which cause intestinal 
mucosal damage, although toxin B exhibits greater cytotoxicity. Pepsin-treated 
lactoferrin (PLF) is the decomposed product of lactoferrin (LF), a 
multifunctional glycoprotein with anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we 
investigate the effects of LF and PLF in toxin B-stimulated rat intestinal 
epithelial (IEC-6) cells. Different toxin B concentrations were added to IEC-6 
cells with or without LF or PLF. Mitochondrial function and cell cytotoxicity 
were assessed by measuring WST-1 and LDH levels, respectively. WST-1 levels were 
higher in IEC-6 cells treated with toxin B and LF or PLF than in the toxin 
B-only control (P < 0.05). Compared with the toxin B-only control, LDH levels 
significantly decreased after toxin B and LF or PLF addition (P < 0.05). Wound 
restitution measurement using microscopy demonstrated significantly greater 
levels of wound restitution in cells treated with toxin B and LF or PLF than in 
those treated with toxin B alone after 12 h (P < 0.001). Furthermore, changes in 
IEC-6 cell tight junctions (TJs) were evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy 
and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein expression. When LF or PLF were added to 
IEC-6 cells, TJ structures were maintained, and ZO-1 and occludin expression was 
upregulated. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LF and PLF prevent 
the cytotoxicity of toxin B and might have the potential to control CDI.

Enteric glial cells (EGCs), one main cell population of the enteric nervous 
system (ENS), play a major role in regulating intestinal barrier function. 
Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is the major virulence factor produced by 
C. difficile and estimated to be toxic to EGCs by inducing cell death, cell 
cycle arrest, and inflammatory cytokine production; however, the detailed 
mechanism for such effect is still unclear. In this study, we further evaluated 
the toxic effect of TcdB on EGCs and the involvement of NADPH oxidases in such 
process using the rat-transformed EGCs (CRL-2690). The results showed that NOX4 
was activated by TcdB in EGCs and functioned as the major factor causing 
cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis. Mechanically, NOX4-generated H2O2 was the 
inducer of oxidative stress, Ca2+ homeostasis disorder, and ER stress in EGCs 
upon TcdB treatment, and NOX4 inhibition protected EGCs against TcdB toxicity 
via attenuating these dysfunctions. These findings contribute to our 
understanding of the mechanism by which TcdB affects EGCs and suggest the 
potential value of NOX4 inhibition for treatment against C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are the leading cause of world-wide 
nosocomial acquired diarrhea. The current main clinical challenge in CDI is the 
elevated rate of infection recurrence that may reach up to 30% of the patients, 
which has been associated to the formation of dormant spores during the 
infection. We sought to characterize the effects of oral administration of 
specific anti-spore IgY in mouse models of CDI and recurrent CDI. The 
specificity of anti-spore IgY was evaluated in vitro. In both, initiation mouse 
model and recurrence mouse model, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic 
effect of anti-spore IgY, respectively. Our results demonstrate that anti-spore 
IgY exhibited high specificity and titers against C. difficile spores and 
reduced spore adherence to intestinal cells in vitro. Administration of 
anti-spore IgY to C57BL/6 mice prior and during CDI delayed the appearance of 
the diarrhea by 1.5 day, and spore adherence to the colonic mucosa by 90%. 
Notably, in the recurrence model, co-administration of anti-spore IgY coupled 
with vancomycin delayed the appearance of recurrent diarrhea by a median of 2 
days. Collectively, these observations suggest that anti-spore IgY antibodies 
may be used as a novel prophylactic treatment for CDI, or in combination with 
antibiotics to treat CDI and prevent recurrence of the infection.

The dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), human pathogenic 
bacteria (HPB), and antibiotic-resistant HPB (ARHPB) from animal feedlot to 
nearby environment poses a potentially high risk to environmental ecology and 
public health. Here, a metagenomic analysis was employed to explore the 
dissemination of ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from a pig feedlot to surrounding stream 
and agricultural soils. In total, not detectable (ND)-1,628.4 μg/kg of 
antibiotic residues, 18 types of ARGs, 48 HPB species, and 216 ARB isolates were 
detected in all samples. Antibiotic residues from pig feedlot mainly migrated 
into stream sediments and greenhouse soil. The dominant ARGs and HPB species 
from pig feedlot spread into stream sediments (tetracycline resistance genes, 
Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), stream water (multidrug 
resistance (MDR) genes, Shigella flexneri, and Bordetella pertussis), and 
greenhouse soil (MDR genes, Bacillus anthracis, and Brucella melitensis). It is 
concerning that 54.4% of 216 ARB isolates from all samples were potential ARHPB 
species, and genome sequencing and functional annotation of 4 MDR HPB isolates 
showed 9 ARG types. Our findings revealed the potential migration and 
dissemination of antibiotic residues, ARGs, HPB, and ARHPB from pig feedlot to 
surrounding stream and agricultural soils via pig sewage discharge and manure 
fertilization.

Clostridium difficile is a global health burden and the leading cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhoea worldwide, causing severe gastrointestinal 
disease and death. Three well characterised toxins are encoded by this bacterium 
in two genetic loci, specifically, TcdB (toxin B) and TcdA (toxin A) in the 
Pathogenicity Locus (PaLoc) and binary toxin (CDT) in the genomically distinct 
CDT locus (CdtLoc). Toxin production is controlled by regulators specific to 
each locus. The orphan response regulator, CdtR, encoded within the CdtLoc, 
up-regulates CDT production. Until now there has been no suggestion that CdtR 
influences TcdA and TcdB production since it is not carried by all 
PaLoc-containing strains and CdtLoc is not linked genetically to PaLoc. Here we 
show that, in addition to CDT, CdtR regulates TcdA and TcdB production but that 
this effect is strain dependent. Of clinical relevance, CdtR increased the 
production of TcdA, TcdB and CDT in two epidemic ribotype 027 human strains, 
modulating their virulence in a mouse infection model. Strains traditionally 
from animal lineages, notably ribotype 078 strains, are increasingly being 
isolated from humans and their genetic and phenotypic analysis is critical for 
future studies on this important pathogen. Here we show that CdtR-mediated toxin 
regulation did not occur in other strain backgrounds, including a ribotype 078 
animal strain. The finding that toxin gene regulation is strain dependent 
highlights the regulatory diversity between C. difficile isolates and the 
importance of studying virulence regulation in diverse lineages and clinically 
relevant strains. Our work provides the first evidence that TcdA, TcdB and CDT 
production is linked by a common regulatory mechanism and that CdtR may act as a 
global regulator of virulence in epidemic 027 strains.

The objective of this study was to detect C. difficile A/B toxins and to isolate 
strains of C. perfringens and C. difficile from diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs 
in Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 57 dogs, 35 of which were 
apparently healthy, and 22 of which were diarrheic. C. difficile A/B toxins were 
detected by ELISA, and C. perfringens and C. difficile were identified by 
multiplex PCR. C. difficile A/B toxins were detected in 21 samples (36.8%). Of 
these, 16 (76.2%) were from diarrheic dogs, and five (23.8%) were from 
non-diarrheic dogs. Twelve C. difficile strains (21.1%) were isolated, of which 
ten were A(+)B(+) and two were A(-)B(-). All non-toxigenic strains were isolated 
from non-diarrheic animals. The binary toxin gene cdtB was found in one strain, 
which was A(+)B(+) and was derived from a non-diarrheic dog. C. perfringens 
strains were isolated from 40 samples (70.2%). Of these, 18 (45%) were from the 
diarrheic group, and 22 (55%) belonged to the non-diarrheic group. All isolates 
were classified as C. perfringens type A and there was an association between 
the detection of the cpe gene and the presence of diarrhea. Interestingly, ten 
strains (25%) were positive for the presence of the cpb2 gene. The high rate of 
detection of the A/B toxins in non-diarrheic dogs suggests the occurrence of 
subclinical disease in dogs or carriage of its toxins without disease. More 
studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology of C. difficile and C. 
perfringens in dogs and to better our understanding of C. difficile as a 
zoonotic agent. This is the first study to report the binary toxin gene in C. 
difficile strains isolated from dogs in Brazil.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive spore-former bacterium and the leading 
cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea that can culminate in fatal 
colitis. During the infection, C. difficile produces metabolically dormant 
spores, which persist in the host and can cause recurrence of the infection. The 
surface of C. difficile spores seems to be the key in spore-host interactions 
and persistence. The proteome of the outermost exosporium layer of C. difficile 
spores has been determined, identifying two cysteine-rich exosporium proteins, 
CdeC and CdeM. In this work, we explore the contribution of both cysteine-rich 
proteins in exosporium integrity, spore biology and pathogenesis. Using targeted 
mutagenesis coupled with transmission electron microscopy we demonstrate that 
both cysteine rich proteins, CdeC and CdeM, are morphogenetic factors of the 
exosporium layer of C. difficile spores. Notably, cdeC, but not cdeM spores, 
exhibited defective spore coat, and were more sensitive to ethanol, heat and 
phagocytic cells. In a healthy colonic mucosa (mouse ileal loop assay), cdeC and 
cdeM spore adherence was lower than that of wild-type spores; while in a mouse 
model of recurrence of the disease, cdeC mutant exhibited an increased infection 
and persistence during recurrence. In a competitive infection mouse model, cdeC 
mutant had increased fitness over wild-type. Through complementation analysis 
with FLAG fusion of known exosporium and coat proteins, we demonstrate that CdeC 
and CdeM are required for the recruitment of several exosporium proteins to the 
surface of C. difficile spores. CdeC appears to be conserved exclusively in 
related Peptostreptococcaeace family members, while CdeM is unique to C. 
difficile. Our results sheds light on how CdeC and CdeM affect the biology of C. 
difficile spores and the assembly of the exosporium layer and, demonstrate that 
CdeC affect C. difficile pathogenesis.

Clostridium difficile is a human and animal pathogen. Recently, the incidence of 
community-acquired C. difficile infection has increased, and many studies have 
indicated that C. difficile might be food-borne. The correlation between C. 
difficile infection in humans and in animals has been a topic of debate. The 
objective of this study was to determine the genetic relatedness of C. difficile 
from human and pigs in Taiwan. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of C. 
difficile in healthy humans and pigs from 2011 to 2015. The isolation rate of C. 
difficile from pigs in 13 commercial farms was 49% (100/204), and a high 
proportion of hypervirulent (C. difficile carrying tcdA, tcdB, and cdtA/B genes 
and a 39-bp deletion in the tcdC gene) ribotype 078 lineage isolates (90%, 
90/100; including 078, 126, 127, and 066-like isolates) were identified. In 
addition, the C. difficile ribotype 127 isolates from pigs typically exhibited 
moxifloxacin resistance (37/43; 86%). In healthy humans, the isolation rate was 
4.3% (3/69), and all healthy human isolates were non-toxigenic. In particular, 
we compared the porcine isolates with two patient strains (ribotype 127) 
obtained from two hospitals in central Taiwan. The multilocus variable number 
tandem repeat analysis revealed a high genetic relatedness between ribotype 127 
from patients and pigs. This study indicated that isolates of the ribotype 078 
lineage, and especially ribotype 127, were widely distributed in pig farms and 
showed a high frequency of moxifloxacin resistance. The closely related ribotype 
127 from patients and pigs may have had a common origin or low diversity. In 
conclusion, C. difficile ribotype 127 is a noteworthy pathogen in pigs and poses 
a potential public health threat.

Clostridium difficile is commonly associated with healthcare-related infections 
in humans, and is an emerging pathogen in food animal species. There is 
potential for transmission of C. difficile from animals or animal products to 
humans. This study aimed to determine if C. difficile RT 237 had persisted in a 
Western Australian piggery or if there had been a temporal change in 
C. difficile diversity. C. difficile carriage in litters with and without 
diarrhea was investigated, as was the acquisition of C. difficile over time 
using cohort surveys. Rectal swabs were obtained from piglets aged 1-10 days to 
determine prevalence of C. difficile carriage and samples were obtained from 20 
piglets on days 1, 7, 13, 20, and 42 of life to determine duration of shedding. 
Isolation of C. difficile from feces was achieved by selective enrichment 
culture. All isolates were characterized by standard molecular typing. 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on selected isolates 
(n = 29). Diarrheic piglets were more likely to shed C. difficile than the 
non-diseased (p = 0.0124, χ2). In the cohort study, C. difficile was isolated 
from 40% samples on day 1, 50% on day 7, 20% on day 13, and 0% on days 20 and 
42. All isolates were RT 237 and no antimicrobial resistance was detected. The 
decline of shedding of C. difficile to zero has public health implications 
because slaughter age pigs have a low likelihood of spreading C. difficile to 
consumers via pig meat.

Faecal carriage of Clostridium difficile in healthy animals has been reported 
recently, especially in piglets and calves. However there is limited data about 
carriage in animals just prior to slaughter in Europe. The main objective of 
this study was to determine the presence of C. difficile in pigs and cattle at 
the slaughterhouse. C. difficile was isolated in 6.9% of the cattle at the 
slaughterhouse. None of the pig slaughter samples were positive for C. difficile 
after an enrichment time of 72 h. For complementary data, a short study was 
conducted in piglets and calves at farms. C. difficile was more prevalent in 
piglets (78.3%) than in calves (22.2%) on the farms. Regarding the piglet 
samples, 27.8% of the positive samples were detected without enrichment of 
stools. The PCR ribotype 078 was predominant in farm animals. Samples isolated 
from slaughter cattle presented the widest range in PCR-ribotype variety, and 
the most prevalent PCR ribotype was 118a UCL. The results of this study confirm 
that C. difficile is present in slaughter animals in Belgium with a large 
percentage of toxigenic strains also commonly found in humans.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of Clostridium 
difficile in intestinal and carcass samples collected from pigs and cattle at a 
single slaughterhouse. C. difficile was isolated in 1% and 9.9% of the pig and 
cattle intestinal contents and in 7.9% and 7% of cattle and pig carcass samples 
respectively. A total of 19 different PCR-ribotypes were identified, among them 
types 078 and 014. Seven of 19 ribotypes correlated with the PCR-ribotypes 
involved in human C. difficile infections in Belgium. This study confirms that 
animals are carriers of C. difficile at slaughter and ribotypes are identical 
than those in humans, and that carcass contamination occurs inside the 
slaughterhouse.

The expression of the Clostridium difficile binary toxin CDT is generally 
observed in the RT027 (ST1) and RT078 (ST11) C. difficile isolates, which are 
associated with severe C. difficile infection (CDI). However, we recently 
reported that the non-RT027 and non-RT078 C. difficile strain LC693 (TcdA+TcdB+ 
CDT+, ST201) caused severe diarrhea in a patient in Xiangya Hospital in China. 
C.difficile LC693 is a member of Clade 3, and in this study, we identified LC693 
as RT871 and compared its virulence and pathogenicity to those of C.difficile 
R20291 (TcdA+TcdB+CDT+, ST1/RT027), UK6 (TcdA+TcdB+CDT+, ST35/RT027), CD630 
(TcdA+TcdB+CDT-, ST54, RT012), and 1379 (TcdA+TcdB+CDT-, ST54/RT012), with 
strain 1379 being an epidemic C.difficile isolate from the same hospital. LC693 
displayed a higher sporulation rate than R20291, CD630 or strain 1379. LC693 was 
comparable to R20291 with respect to spore germination, motility, and biofilm 
formation, but showed a faster germination rate, higher motility and a higher 
biofilm formation capability compared to CD630 and strain 1379. The adherence of 
spores to human gut epithelial cells was similar for all strains.The total toxin 
release of LC693 was lower than that of R20291, but higher than that of CD630 
and strain 1379. Finally, in a mouse model of CDI, LC693 was capable of causing 
moderate to severe disease. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenicity of 
non-RT027 and non-RT078 binary toxin-positive C. difficile strains. Furthermore, 
our data indicate that LC693 may be more virulent than strain 1379, an epidemic 
strain from the same hospital, and provide the first phenotypic characterization 
of a non-RT027 and non-RT078 binary toxin-positive ST201 isolate.

The prevalence of Clostridium difficile in 107 dogs with diverse digestive 
disorders attended in a Spanish veterinary teaching hospital was assessed. The 
microorganism was isolated from 13 dogs (12.1%) of different disease groups. 
Isolates belonged to PCR ribotypes 078, 106, 154 and 430 (all of them toxigenic) 
and 110 (non-toxigenic), and were resistant to several antimicrobial drugs. 
Notably, seven isolates obtained from different dogs displayed stable resistance 
to metronidazole. The results of this study provide further evidence that dogs 
can act as a reservoir of C. difficile strains of epidemic ribotypes with 
resistance to multiple antibiotics.

Nosocomial acquisition of Clostridium difficile is well documented, yet recent 
studies have highlighted the importance of community acquired infections and 
identified community associated reservoirs for this pathogen. Multiple studies 
have implicated companion pets and farm animals as possible sources of community 
acquired C. difficile infections in humans. To explore the potential role of pet 
dogs in human C. difficile infections we systematically collected canine fecal 
samples (n = 197) in Flagstaff, AZ. Additionally, nineteen fecal samples were 
collected at a local veterinary clinic from diarrheic dogs. We used these 
combined samples to investigate important questions regarding C. difficile 
colonization in pet canines: 1) What is the prevalence and diversity of C. 
difficile in this companion pet population, and 2) Do C. difficile isolates 
collected from canines genetically overlap with isolates that cause disease in 
humans? We used a two-step sequence typing approach, including multilocus 
sequence typing to determine the overall genetic diversity of C. difficile 
present in Flagstaff canines, and whole-genome sequencing to assess the 
fine-scale diversity patterns within identical multilocus sequence types from 
isolates obtained within and among multiple canine hosts. We detected C. 
difficile in 17% of the canine fecal samples with 10% containing toxigenic 
strains that are known to cause human disease. Sequencing analyses revealed 
similar genotypes in dogs and humans. These findings suggest that companion pets 
are a potential source of community acquired C. difficile infections in humans.

Human Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is of unquestioned 
importance in humans, and has been a not-uncommon cause of enteric disease in 
horses, dogs, and ratites. Over the past 5 years, C. difficile has emerged as a 
major cause of neonatal enteritis in pigs. Piglets 1-7 days of age are affected, 
with gross lesions frequently including mesocolonic edema. Colonic contents may 
be pasty-to-watery and yellow, although some piglets are constipated or 
obstipated. Focal suppuration and segmental necrosis are seen on microscopic 
examination of cecal and colonic lamina propria, and exudation of neutrophils 
and fibrin into the lumen gives rise to the so-called volcano lesions. Results 
of one study revealed that more than one-third of piglets with enteritis were 
affected by C. difficile alone, while an additional quarter of affected piglets 
may have had mixed infections. C. difficile may be the most important 
uncontrolled cause of neonatal diarrhea in pigs.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common causes of 
healthcare-associated infections but an even bigger problem for the aging 
population. Advanced age leads to higher incidence, higher mortality, and higher 
recurrences. In our study, recently published in the Journal of Infectious 
Diseases, we investigated the effect of aging on CDI using a mouse model. We 
were able to demonstrate that aging leads to worse clinical outcomes, as well as 
lead to changes in microbiota composition and lower antibody production against 
C. difficile toxin A, but not toxin B. An association between advanced age and 
lower antibody production against C. difficile is a new finding which would 
explain the effect of aging on CDI outcome. Vancomycin, an anti-C. difficile 
antibiotic, led to similar changes in antibody response, suggesting a connection 
between microbiome and antibody response in the context of aging, which would 
require a much more nuanced look at the treatment of CDI.

Muricholic acids inhibit Clostridium difficile spore germination and growth.

States of America.

Infections caused by Clostridium difficile have increased steadily over the past 
several years. While studies on C. difficile virulence and physiology have been 
hindered, in the past, by lack of genetic approaches and suitable animal models, 
newly developed technologies and animal models allow these processes to be 
studied in detail. One such advance is the generation of a mouse-model of C. 
difficile infection. The development of this system is a major step forward in 
analyzing the genetic requirements for colonization and infection. While 
important, it is equally as important in understanding what differences exist 
between mice and humans. One of these differences is the natural bile acid 
composition. Bile acid-mediated spore germination is an important step in C. 
difficile colonization. Mice produce several different bile acids that are not 
found in humans. These muricholic acids have the potential to impact C. 
difficile spore germination. Here we find that the three muricholic acids 
(α-muricholic acid, β-muricholic acid and ω-muricholic acid) inhibit C. 
difficile spore germination and can impact the growth of vegetative cells. These 
results highlight an important difference between humans and mice and may have 
an impact on C. difficile virulence in the mouse-model of C. difficile 
infection.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic- and 
healthcare-associated diarrhea. CXCL13 is a well-known CXC chemokine involved in 
inflammation, but its role in CDI remains unknown. In this study, serum and 
fecal samplings were collected from 51 CDI patients, 50 diarrhea patients 
without CDI and 50 healthy control subjects to determine the CXCL13 levels by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Besides, a mouse model of C. 
difficile infection was established, and murine serum and colon tissues were 
collected for detection of CXCL13 expression using quantitative real-time 
RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot, or immunohistochemistry. We found that CXCL13 
concentration in serum and fecal samples from CDI patients was significantly 
higher compared with that from diarrhea patients without CDI and that from 
healthy controls. Elevated serum CXCL13 positively and significantly correlated 
with blood markers of inflammation and yielded an increased area under the ROC 
curve of 0.929. In murine C. difficile infection, CXCL13 were also dramatically 
increased in serum and infected colon tissues at the transcriptional and protein 
levels. The elevated CXCL13 levels positively and significantly correlated with 
inflammatory scores. Therefore, CDI is associated with enhanced release of 
CXCL13. This study indicated that CXCL13 may be pathogenically involved in CDI 
and served as a potential new biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in CDI.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Turkish folk medicine, leaves of Sorbus 
domestica are used for the treatment of burns, cough, stomachache, bradyuria, 
kidney stone. The fruits of this plant are used for diarrhoea.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was carried out to investigate the effect of S. 
domestica on ulcerative colitis induced by acetic acid in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude methanolic extract of fruits was sequentially 
fractionated into five subextracts; dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl 
acetate, n-butanol and aqueous extracts. Effects of the extract, subextracts and 
fractions were investigated in acetic acid-induced rat colitis model. The 
colonic interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), nitrite, superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), 
and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as well as the caspase-3 and myeloperoxidase 
(MPO) activities were measured to determine the activity. Histopathological 
analyzes were also performed on the colon tissue of rats.
RESULTS: The methanolic extract and diethylether subextract have led to a 
noteworthy decrease in MPO, caspase-3, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, and nitrite levels in 
the colon tissue and blood. In addition, histopathological analysis results were 
supported by biochemical parameters. After confirmation of the activity against 
ulcerative colitis, the diethyl ether subextract was subjected to more 
chromatographic separation for the isolation of compounds 1, 2 and 3. The 
structures of these three compounds were elucidated as vanillic acid 
4-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (1), protocateuic acid anhydrite (2) and 
trivanilloyl-(1,3,4-trihydroxybenzol) ester (3).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the potential of S. domestica in the treatment of 
colitis was investigated. Fruits of this plant were found to have important 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Through isolation techniques, 
vanillic acid 4-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside, protocateuic acid anhydrite and 
trivanilloyl-(1,3,4-trihydroxybenzol) ester were determined as the main active 
components of the fruits. Consequently, S domestica might be a promising 
candidate for upcoming use the prevention and treatment of various disorders, 
such as inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome and Clostridium 
difficile infection.

The glycylcycline antibiotic tigecycline was approved in 2005 for the treatment 
of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and complicated intra-abdominal 
infections. Tigecycline is broadly active against both Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive microorganisms, including Clostridium difficile. Tigecycline has a 
low MIC against C. difficile in vitro and thus may represent an alternate 
treatment for C. difficile infection (CDI). To assess the use of tigecycline for 
treatment of established CDI, 5- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were colonized with 
C. difficile strain 630. After C. difficile colonization was established, mice 
(n = 10 per group) were treated with either a 5-day course of tigecycline (6.25 
mg/kg every 12 h subcutaneously) or a 5-day course of vancomycin (0.4 mg/ml in 
drinking water) and compared to infected, untreated control mice. Mice were 
evaluated for clinical signs of CDI throughout treatment and at 1 week 
posttreatment to assess potential for disease development. Immediately following 
a treatment course, C. difficile was not detectable in the feces of 
vancomycin-treated mice but remained detectable in feces from 
tigecycline-treated and untreated control mice. Toxin activity and 
histopathological inflammation and edema were observed in the ceca and colons of 
untreated mice; tigecycline- and vancomycin-treated mice did not show such 
changes directly after treatment. One week after the conclusion of either 
antibiotic treatment, C. difficile load, toxin activity, and histopathology 
scores increased in the cecum and colon, indicating that C. difficile-associated 
disease occurred. In vitro growth studies confirmed that subinhibitory 
concentrations of tigecycline were able to suppress toxin activity and spore 
formation of C. difficile, whereas vancomycin did not. Taken together, these 
data show how tigecycline is able to alter C. difficile pathogenesis in a mouse 
model of CDI.

difficile within 1 min. C18:1K (proportion removed: 90.3%) was significantly 
more effective at removing Staphylococcus aureus biofilms than the synthetic 
surfactant detergents sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) (74.8%, p < 0.01) and 
sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) (78.0%, p < 0.05). In the WST (water-soluble 
tetrazolium) assay, mouse fibroblasts (BALB/3T3 clone A31) in C18:1K (relative 
viability vs. control: 102.8%) demonstrated a significantly higher viability 
than those in SLES (30.1%) or SLS (18.1%, p < 0.05). In a lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) leakage assay, C18:1K (relative leakage vs. control: 108.9%) was found to 
be associated with a significantly lower LDH leakage from mouse fibroblasts than 
SLES or SLS (720.6% and 523.4%, respectively; p < 0.05). Potassium oleate 
demonstrated bactericidal effects against various species including 
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium 
difficile; removed significantly greater amounts of Staphylococcus aureus 
biofilm material than SLES and SLS; and maintained fibroblast viability; 
therefore, it might be useful for wound cleaning and peri-wound skin.

OBJECTIVES: To longitudinally assess the shedding of antimicrobial resistant 
Clostridium difficile strains by clinically healthy dogs raised at breeding 
facilities.
METHODS: 18 puppies from three different litters (#1, 2 and 3) were sampled 
weekly from parturition to day 20-55 postpartum. Faecal samples from the mothers 
of litters #2 and 3 were also available for analysis. Bacterial isolates were 
ribotyped, tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility and further 
characterised.
RESULTS: C. difficile was recovered from all sampled animals of litters #1 and 
2, and a third of puppies from litter #3, but marked differences in C. difficile 
recovery were detected in different age groups (0-100%). Recovered PCR ribotypes 
included 056 (22 isolates), 010 (6 isolates), 078 and 213 (2 isolates each), and 
009 and 020 (1 isolate each). Different ribotypes were shed by four individual 
animals. Regardless of their origin and ribotype, all isolates demonstrated full 
resistance to levofloxacin. Additionally, all but one isolate (belonging to 
ribotype 078) were resistant to ertapenem, and all ribotype 010 isolates 
displayed high-level resistance to clindamycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. 
A single ribotype 078 isolate showed metronidazole heteroresistance.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Healthy dogs can shed antimicrobial-resistant C. 
difficile strains.

Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of primary and recurrent 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in hospitalized patients. The disease 
is caused mainly by two exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB, produced by the bacteria. 
Recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI) constitutes one of the most significant 
clinical issues of this disease, occurs in more than 20% of patients after the 
first episode, and may be increasing in frequency. However, there is no 
well-established animal model of CDI relapse currently available for studying 
disease pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy. Here we report the establishment 
of a conventional mouse model of recurrence/relapse CDI. We found that the 
primary episode of CDI induced little or no protective antibody response against 
C. difficile toxins and mice continued shedding C. difficile spores. Antibiotic 
treatment of surviving mice induced a second episode of diarrhea, while a 
simultaneous reexposure of animals to C. difficile bacteria or spores elicited a 
full spectrum of CDI similar to that of the primary infection. Moreover, mice 
treated with immunosuppressive agents were prone to more severe and fulminant 
recurrent disease. Finally, utilizing this model, we demonstrated that 
vancomycin only delayed disease recurrence, whereas neutralizing polysera 
against both TcdA and TcdB completely protected mice against CDI relapse. In 
conclusion, we have established a mouse relapse CDI model that allows for future 
investigations of the role of the host immune response in the disease's 
pathogenesis and permits critical testing of new therapeutics targeting 
recurrent disease.

Clostridium difficile induces antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to the release 
of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), the latter being its main virulence 
factor. The epidemic strain NAP1/027 has an increased virulence attributed to 
different factors. We compared cellular intoxication by TcdBNAP1 with that by 
the reference strain VPI 10463 (TcdBVPI). In a mouse ligated intestinal loop 
model, TcdBNAP1 induced higher neutrophil recruitment, cytokine release, and 
epithelial damage than TcdBVPI. Both toxins modified the same panel of small 
GTPases and exhibited similar in vitro autoprocessing kinetics. On the basis of 
sequence variations in the frizzled-binding domain (FBD), we reasoned that 
TcdBVPI and TcdBNAP1 might have different receptor specificities. To test this 
possibility, we used a TcdB from a NAP1 variant strain (TcdBNAP1v) unable to 
glucosylate RhoA but with the same receptor-binding domains as TcdBNAP1. Cells 
were preincubated with TcdBNAP1v to block cellular receptors, prior to 
intoxication with either TcdBVPI or TcdBNAP1. Preincubation with TcdBNAP1v 
blocked RhoA glucosylation by TcdBNAP1 but not by TcdBVPI, indicating that the 
toxins use different host factors for cell entry. This crucial difference might 
explain the increased biological activity of TcdBNAP1 in the intestine, 
representing a contributing factor for the increased virulence of the NAP1/027 
strain.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the 
western world. Toxins (A, B, and binary toxins) generated by C. difficile 
bacteria damage intestinal epithelial cells. Hallmarks of host response to 
C. difficile infection (CDI) include upregulation of inflammatory mediators and 
tissue infiltration by immune cells. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
(MIF) is an inflammatory cytokine that is known to enhance the host immune 
response to infectious pathogens. Additionally, MIF can adversely impact host 
survival to numerous infections. The role of MIF in the pathogenesis of CDI 
remains poorly understood. Here, we show that patients with CDI had 
significantly higher circulating MIF compared to patients who had diarrhea but 
tested negative for C. difficile (non-CDI controls). Similarly, in a mouse 
model, C. difficile challenge significantly increased levels of plasma and 
tissue MIF. Antibody-mediated depletion of MIF decreased C. difficile-induced 
inflammatory responses, clinical disease, and mortality. Together, these results 
uncover a potential role for MIF in exacerbating CDI and suggest that use of 
anti-MIF antibodies may represent a therapeutic strategy to curb host 
inflammatory responses and improve disease outcomes in CDI.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) symptoms range from diarrhea to severe 
toxic megacolon and even death. Due to its rapid acquisition of resistance, 
C. difficile is listed as an urgent antibiotic-resistant threat, and has 
surpassed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the most common 
hospital-acquired infection in the USA. To combat this pathogen, a new 
structural class of pseudo-peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activities could 
play an important role. Herein we report a set of bis-cyclic guanidine compounds 
that show potent antibacterial activity against C. difficile with decent 
selectivity. Eight compounds showed high in vitro potency against C. difficile 
UK6 with MIC values of 1.0 μg mL-1 , and cytotoxic selectivity index (SI) values 
up to 37. Moreover, the most selective compound is also effective in the 
treatment of C. difficile-induced disease in a mouse model of CDI, and appears 
to be a very promising new candidate for the treatment of CDI.

Clostridium difficile releases two exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, which disrupt 
the epithelial cell barrier in the gut to increase mucosal permeability and 
trigger inflammation with severe diarrhea. Many studies have suggested that 
enteric nerves are also directly involved in the progression of this 
toxin-mediated inflammation and diarrhea. C. difficile toxin A is known to 
enhance neurotransmitter secretion, increase gut motility, and suppress 
sympathetic neurotransmission in the guinea pig colitis model. Although previous 
studies have examined the pathophysiological role of enteric nerves in gut 
inflammation, the direct effect of toxins on neuronal cells and the molecular 
mechanisms underlying toxin-induced neuronal stress remained to be unveiled. 
Here, we examined the toxicity of C. difficile toxin A against neuronal cells 
(SH-SY5Y). We found that toxin A treatment time- and dose-dependently decreased 
cell viability and triggered apoptosis accompanied by caspase-3 activation in 
this cell line. These effects were found to depend on the up-regulation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent activation of p38 MAPK and 
induction of p21Cip1/Waf1. Moreover, the N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)-induced 
down-regulation of ROS could recover the viability loss and apoptosis of toxin 
A-treated neuronal cells. These results collectively suggest that C. difficile 
toxin A is toxic for neuronal cells, and that this is associated with rapid ROS 
generation and subsequent p38 MAPK activation and p21Cip1/Waf1 up-regulation. 
Moreover, our data suggest that NAC could inhibit the toxicity of C. difficile 
toxin A toward enteric neurons.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 30-40% of children <1 year of age are Clostridium 
difficile colonized, and may represent a reservoir for adult C. difficile 
infections (CDI). Risk factors for colonization with toxigenic versus 
non-toxigenic C. difficile strains and longitudinal acquisition dynamics in 
infants remain incompletely characterized.
METHODS: Predominantly healthy infants (≤2 years) were recruited in Oxfordshire, 
UK, and provided ≥1 fecal samples. Independent risk factors for 
toxigenic/non-toxigenic C. difficile colonization and acquisition were 
identified using multivariable regression. Infant C. difficile isolates were 
whole-genome sequenced to assay genetic diversity and prevalence of 
toxin-associated genes, and compared with sequenced strains from Oxfordshire CDI 
cases.
RESULTS: 338/365 enrolled infants provided 1332 fecal samples, representing 158 
C. difficile colonization or carriage episodes (107[68%] toxigenic). Initial 
colonization was associated with age, and reduced with breastfeeding but 
increased with pet dogs. Acquisition was associated with older age, Caesarean 
delivery, and diarrhea. Breastfeeding and pre-existing C. difficile colonization 
reduced acquisition risk. Overall 13% of CDI C. difficile strains were 
genetically related to infant strains. 29(18%) infant C. difficile sequences 
were consistent with recent direct/indirect transmission to/from Oxfordshire CDI 
cases (≤2 single nucleotide variants [SNVs]); 79(50%) shared a common origin 
with an Oxfordshire CDI case within the last ~5 years (0-10 SNVs). The 
hypervirulent, epidemic ST1/ribotype 027 remained notably absent in infants in 
this large study, as did other lineages such as STs 10/44 (ribotype 015); the 
most common strain in infants was ST2 (ribotype 020/014)(22%).
CONCLUSIONS: In predominantly healthy infants without significant healthcare 
exposure C. difficile colonization and acquisition reflect environmental 
exposures, with pet dogs identified as a novel risk factor. Genetic overlap 
between some infant strains and those isolated from CDI cases suggest common 
community reservoirs of these C. difficile lineages, contrasting with those 
lineages found only in CDI cases, and therefore more consistent with 
healthcare-associated spread.

Molecular typing of Clostridium difficile isolates from animals and humans may 
be useful for evaluation of the possibility for interspecies transmission. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate C. difficile isolates from domestic 
animals and humans using PCR ribotyping. Isolates were also tested using PCR for 
the presence of genes encoding toxins A and B. One hundred and thirty-three 
isolates of C. difficile from dogs (n = 92), horses (n = 21) and humans (n = 
20), plus one each from a cat and a calf, were evaluated. Overall, 23 ribotypes 
were identified. Of these, nine were identified from dogs, 12 from horses, seven 
from humans and one each from the cat and calf. In dogs, humans and horses, one 
or two different ribotypes predominated. Overall, 25 % of isolates from humans 
were indistinguishable from isolates from one or more animal species. Genes 
encoding C. difficile toxins A and B were detected in all human, equine and 
bovine isolates, and in 69 % of canine isolates. While different ribotypes 
appear to predominate in different mammalian species, several indistinguishable 
strains may be found in multiple species. This suggests that there is a 
potential for interspecies transmission of C. difficile and epidemiological 
studies are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Successful clinical outcomes of faecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection have been reported in humans 
and a marmoset. However, it has been unclear whether oral FMT was effective for 
the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in dogs.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old, intact male French bulldog was presented with 
a 4-month history of intermittent large bowel diarrhoea. Physical and clinical 
examinations did not identify any specific causes for diarrhoea. Real-time PCR 
analysis and immunochromatography detected C. difficile antigen and toxin A&B 
genes and proteins in a faecal sample. Based on these findings, diarrhoea in the 
dog was considered to be induced by C. difficile-associated colitis. The dog was 
treated with oral FMT, in which a faecal solution obtained from a healthy beagle 
was orally administered to the subject. Stool consistency and frequency and 
faecal blood and mucus became normal 2-3 days after oral FMT, and real-time PCR 
analysis and immunochromatography was negative for C. difficile antigen and 
toxin A&B genes and proteins. No adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSION: The present case report demonstrated that oral FMT was an effective 
treatment for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in a dog. The findings in this 
report provide a rationale to evaluate clinical efficacy of oral FMT for other 
gastrointestinal diseases in dogs.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the high incidence of ribotype 078 
Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in the Netherlands is related to pig 
farming.
METHODS: We used data of hospitalised CDI patients (>2yrs of age) diagnosed 
between May 2009 and May 2015 in 26 hospitals participating in a national 
sentinel surveillance. We compared clinical and geographical characteristics of 
078 CDI to other CDI. We investigated the association between 078 CDI incidence 
and four indicators of pig farming (piglet, pig, piglet farm and pig farm 
density) by mixed-effects Poisson regression. We used a space-time permutation 
model to search for community-onset 078 CDI clusters (using SaTScan).
RESULTS: A total of 4,691 CDI were identified. Ribotype 078 was isolated in 493 
of 3,756 patients (13.1%) including a typing result. These patients had slightly 
higher community-onset disease and a 35% increase of 30-day mortality compared 
to non-078 CDI patients. The pooled overall and 078 incidence rates were 2.82 
(95% CI, 2.42-3.29) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21-0.31) CDI per 10,000 patients-days 
respectively. Hospital 078 CDI incidence was not associated with provincial pig 
(IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08), piglet (IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75-1.19), pig farm 
(IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.39), or piglet farm density (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 
0.56-1.79). No clusters of community-onset ribotype 078 CDI were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not indicate that the ribotype 078 CDI incidence in 
hospitals is related to pig (farm) or piglet (farm) density. However, 
transmission beyond provincial borders or in non-hospitalised patients cannot be 
excluded.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of infectious diarrhea 
among hospitalized patients. Probiotics could be instrumental in restoring the 
intestinal dysbiosis caused by CDI. Here, we examined the protective effect of 
Pediococcus pentosaceus LI05 in a mouse CDI model. C57BL/6 mice were 
administrated P. pentosaceus LI05 (LI05 group) or sterile anaerobic PBS (CDI 
group) everyday for 14 days. Mice were exposed to antibiotics cocktail for 5 
days; then challenged with C. difficile strain VPI10463. Mice were monitored 
daily for survival and weight loss. Colonic tissue and serum samples were 
assessed for intestinal histopathology, intestinal barrier function and systemic 
inflammation. The oral administration of P. pentosaceus LI05 improved the 
survival rate and alleviated the histopathological impact of C. difficile. 
Compared to the CDI group, the levels of inflammatory mediators in the colon as 
well as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in serum were substantially 
attenuated in the LI05 group. P. pentosaceus LI05 alleviated the CDI-induced of 
disruption of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1. Additionally, fecal microbiome 
analysis showed an enrichment in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae and 
Rikenellaceae, while, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae were 
decreased. Our results demonstrated that the preventive effect of P. pentosaceus 
LI05 against CDI was mediated via improving tight junction proteins and 
down-regulating the inflammatory response. Therefore, P. pentosaceus LI05 could 
be a promising probiotic in CDI.

Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2), a serine/threonine protein kinase, is a major 
inflammatory mediator in immune cells. The predominant inflammatory actions of 
TPL2 depend on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and 
the upregulated production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in macrophages and dendritic cells in response to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Significant increases in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-β, and IL-8 
levels in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have been 
reported. Both TNF-α and IL-6 have been postulated to play key roles in the 
systemic inflammatory response in CDI, and IL-8 is essential for the development 
of local intestinal inflammatory responses in CDI. The objective of this study 
was to elucidate the role of TPL2 in the pathogenesis of CDI. We found that TPL2 
was significantly activated in human and mouse intestinal tissues upon C. 
difficile toxin exposure or CDI. We further demonstrated that TPL2 knockout 
(TPL2-KO) mice were significantly more resistant to CDI than wild-type mice, 
with significantly reduced production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, KC (a mouse 
homologue of IL-8), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the ceca and colons of TPL2-KO 
mice. Finally, we found that TPL2 inhibition by a specific inhibitor or TPL2 
gene ablation significantly reduced TcdB-induced production of TNF-α, IL-6, 
IL-β, and KC by inhibiting the activation of p38, extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Taken together, our data 
suggest that TPL2 represents a potential therapeutic target for CDI treatment.

Clostridium difficile is currently the major cause of nosocomial intestinal 
diseases associated with antibiotic therapy in adults. In order to improve our 
knowledge of C. difficile-host interactions, we analyzed the genome-wide 
temporal expression of C. difficile 630 genes during the first 38 h of mouse 
colonization to identify genes whose expression is modulated in vivo, suggesting 
that they may play a role in facilitating the colonization process. In the ceca 
of the C. difficile-monoassociated mice, 549 genes of the C. difficile genome 
were differentially expressed compared to their expression during in vitro 
growth, and they were distributed in several functional categories. Overall, our 
results emphasize the roles of genes involved in host adaptation. Colonization 
results in a metabolic shift, with genes responsible for the fermentation as 
well as several other metabolic pathways being regulated inversely to those 
involved in carbon metabolism. In addition, several genes involved in stress 
responses, such as ferrous iron uptake or the response to oxidative stress, were 
regulated in vivo. Interestingly, many genes encoding conserved hypothetical 
proteins (CHP) were highly and specifically upregulated in vivo. Moreover, genes 
for all stages of sporulation were quickly induced in vivo, highlighting the 
observation that sporulation is central to the persistence of C. difficile in 
the gut and to its ability to spread in the environment. Finally, we inactivated 
two genes that were differentially expressed in vivo and evaluated the relative 
colonization fitness of the wild-type and mutant strains in coinfection 
experiments. We identified a CHP as a putative colonization factor, supporting 
the suggestion that the in vivo transcriptomic approach can unravel new C. 
difficile virulence genes.

Immunotherapy that targets N-linked glycans has not yet been developed due in 
large part to the lack of specificity of N-linked glycans between normal and 
malignant cells. N-Glycan chains are synthesized by the sequential action of 
glycosyl transferases in the Golgi apparatus. It is an overwhelming task to 
discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis 
of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells 
selectively. It has long been known that N-glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited 
by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate 
N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors 
have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require 
increased branching of N-linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, 
we discovered that an anti-Clostridium difficile molecule, aminouridyl 
phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with 
the IC50 value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits N-glycosylation 
of β-catenin at 2.5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and 
tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated 
(IC50 > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of 
tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 
inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (e.g. KB, LoVo, 
SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-432S, HCT116, Panc-1, and AsPC-1) at low μM concentrations, but 
does not inhibit growth of a leukemia cell (L1210) and the healthy cells (Vero 
and HPNE) at these concentrations. In vitro metabolic stability using rat liver 
microsomes indicated that a half-life (t 1/2) of APPB is sufficiently long 
(>60 min) for in vivo studies (PK/PD, safety profiles, and in vivo efficacy) 
using animal models. We have refined all steps in the previously reported 
synthesis for APPB for larger-scale. This article summarizes protocols of 
gram-scale synthesis of APPB and its physicochemical data, and a convenient 
DPAGT1 assay. •Remember that the abstract is what readers see first in

Toxin B (TcdB) is a major pathogenic factor of Clostridum difficile. However, 
the mechanism by which TcdB exerts its cytotoxic action in host cells is still 
not completely known. Herein, we report for the first time that TcdB induced 
autophagic cell death in cultured human colonocytes. The induction of autophagy 
was demonstrated by the increased levels of LC3-II, formation of LC3+ 
autophagosomes, accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles and reduced levels 
of the autophagic substrate p62/SQSTM1. TcdB-induced autophagy was also 
accompanied by the repression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 activity. 
Functionally, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or 
chloroquine or knockdown of autophagy-related genes Beclin 1, Atg5 and Atg7 
attenuated TcdB-induced cell death in colonocytes. Genetic ablation of Atg5, a 
gene required for autophagosome formation, also mitigated the cytotoxic effect 
of TcdB. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that autophagy serves as a 
pro-death mechanism mediating the cytotoxic action of TcdB in colonocytes. This 
discovery suggested that blockade of autophagy might be a novel therapeutic 
strategy for C. difficile infection.

Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dogs that visited human health-care facilities 
were at greater risk of acquiring certain health-care-associated pathogens, 
compared with dogs performing animal-assisted interventions in other settings, 
and to identify specific behaviors of dogs associated with an increased risk of 
acquiring these pathogens.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort and nested case-control studies.
ANIMALS: 96 dogs that visited human health-care facilities and 98 dogs involved 
in other animal-assisted interventions.
PROCEDURES: Fecal samples and nasal swab specimens were collected from dogs at 
the time of recruitment and every 2 months for 1 year and were tested for 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, and 
other selected bacteria. Information was also obtained on facilities visited 
during animal-assisted interventions, dog diet, dog illnesses, and antimicrobial 
use within the home. At the end of the study, dog handlers were asked about the 
behavior of their dogs during visits to health-care facilities.
RESULTS: Rates of acquisition of MRSA and C difficile were 4.7 and 2.4 times as 
high, respectively, among dogs that visited human health-care facilities, 
compared with rates among dogs involved in other animal-assisted interventions. 
Among dogs that visited human health-care facilities, those that licked patients 
or accepted treats during visits were more likely to be positive for MRSA and C 
difficile than were dogs that did not lick patients or accept treats.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that dogs that visited 
human health-care facilities were at risk of acquiring MRSA and C difficile, 
particularly when they licked patients or accepted treats during visits.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a principal cause of 
hospital-acquired infections and fatalities worldwide. The need for new, more 
potent anticlostridial agents is far from being met. Drug repurposing can be 
utilized as a rapid and cost-efficient method of drug development. The current 
study was conducted to evaluate the activity of ronidazole, a veterinary 
antiprotozoal drug, as a potential treatment for CDI. Ronidazole inhibited the 
growth of clinical C. difficile isolates (including NAP1 and toxigenic strains) 
at a very low concentration (0.125 µg/mL) and showed superior killing kinetics 
compared with metronidazole, an anticlostridial agent from the same chemical 
category. In addition, ronidazole did not inhibit growth of several commensal 
organisms naturally present in the human intestine that play a protective role 
in preventing CDIs. Furthermore, ronidazole was found to be non-toxic to human 
gut cells and permeated a monolayer of colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) at a 
slower rate than metronidazole. Finally, ronidazole outperformed metronidazole 
when both were tested at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily in a mouse model of CDI. 
Overall, ronidazole merits further investigation as a potential treatment for 
CDIs.

Clostridium difficile 027/BI/NAP1 encodes a hypertoxic and antigenically 
variable form of TcdB.

Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, United States of America.

The Clostridium difficile exotoxin, TcdB, which is a major virulence factor, 
varies between strains of this pathogen. Herein, we show that TcdB from the 
epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain of C. difficile is more lethal, causes more 
extensive brain hemorrhage, and is antigenically variable from TcdB produced by 
previously studied strains of this pathogen (TcdB003). In mouse intoxication 
assays, TcdB from a ribotype 027 strain (TcdB027) was at least four fold more 
lethal than TcdB003. TcdB027 caused a previously undescribed brain hemorrhage in 
mice and this correlated with a heightened sensitivity of brain microvascular 
endothelial cells to the toxin. TcdB003 and TcdB027 also differed in their 
antigenic profiles and did not share cross-neutralizing epitopes in a major 
immunogenic region of the protein. Solid phase humoral mapping of epitopes in 
the carboxy-terminal domains (CTD) of TcdB027 and TcdB003 identified 11 reactive 
epitopes that varied between the two forms of TcdB, and 13 epitopes that were 
shared or overlapping. Despite the epitope differences and absence of 
neutralizing epitopes in the CTD of TcdB027, a toxoid form of this toxin primed 
a strong protective response. These findings indicate TcdB027 is a more potent 
toxin than TcdB003 as measured by lethality assays and pathology, moreover the 
sequence differences between the two forms of TcdB alter antigenic epitopes and 
reduce cross-neutralization by antibodies targeting the CTD.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is currently the leading cause of infectious 
diarrhea in hospitalized patients. In addition to the infection due to toxigenic 
C. difficile in the gastrointestinal tract of susceptible hosts, other 
predisposing factors for C. difficile infection (CDI) are identified, including 
advanced age, a prolonged hospital stay, and use of acid-suppressive drugs. Of 
note, exposure to gastric acid-reducing agents, such as H2 blockers and proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs), remains a controversial risk factor, and has been 
associated with CDI in some studies but not in others. A mouse model of 
antibiotic-associated clostridial colitis was established to examine the role of 
PPIs for CDI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mouse model of antibiotic-associated clostridial 
colitis was set up. NF-κB reporter mice were used to address the in vivo spatial 
and temporal inflammatory patterns of C. difficile-associated colitis. Serum 
levels of lipopolysaccharide and dextran-FITC were measured to reflect the 
barrier permeability of affected intestines.
RESULTS: Mice with CDI that were exposed to PPI exhibited greater losses of 
stool consistency and body and cecal weights than those that were not exposed to 
PPI. Further, more neutrophilic infiltrations, epithelial damage, and 
inflammatory cytokine expression were noted in colon specimens of the mice with 
PPI exposure. More-evident inflammatory responses were detected by in vivo 
imaging of NF-κB reporter mice with CDI that were exposed to PPI. Gut barrier 
permeability was increased to a greater extent, as reflected by higher serum 
levels of lipopolysaccharide and dextran-FITC in mice with CDI that were exposed 
to PPI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our mouse model demonstrates that PPI exposure increases the 
severity of intestinal inflammation in mice with C. difficile-associated 
colitis.

Improved understanding of the interplay between host and microbes stands to 
illuminate new avenues for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Here, 
we provide a high-resolution view of the dynamics between host and gut 
microbiota during antibiotic-induced intestinal microbiota depletion, 
opportunistic Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium difficile pathogenesis, and 
recovery from these perturbed states in a mouse model. Host-centric proteome and 
microbial community profiles provide a nuanced longitudinal view, revealing the 
interdependence between host and microbiota in evolving dysbioses. Time- and 
condition-specific molecular and microbial signatures are evident and clearly 
distinguished from pathogen-independent inflammatory fingerprints. Our data 
reveal that mice recovering from antibiotic treatment or C. difficile infection 
retain lingering signatures of inflammation, despite compositional normalization 
of the microbiota, and host responses could be rapidly and durably relieved 
through fecal transplant. These experiments demonstrate insights that emerge 
from the combination of these orthogonal, untargeted approaches to the 
gastrointestinal ecosystem.

Clostridium difficile causes nosocomial/antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and 
pseudomembranous colitis. The major virulence factors are toxin A and toxin B 
(TcdB), which inactivate GTPases by monoglucosylation, leading to cytopathic 
(cytoskeleton alteration, cell rounding) and cytotoxic effects (cell-cycle 
arrest, apoptosis). C. difficile toxins breaching the intestinal epithelial 
barrier can act on underlying cells, enterocytes, colonocytes, and enteric 
neurons, as described in vitro and in vivo, but until now no data have been 
available on enteric glial cell (EGC) susceptibility. EGCs are crucial for 
regulating the enteric nervous system, gut homeostasis, the immune and 
inflammatory responses, and digestive and extradigestive diseases. Therefore, we 
evaluated the effects of C. difficile TcdB in EGCs. Rat-transformed EGCs were 
treated with TcdB at 0.1-10 ng/ml for 1.5-48 h, and several parameters were 
analysed. TcdB induces the following in EGCs: (1) early cell rounding with Rac1 
glucosylation; (2) early G2/M cell-cycle arrest by cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex 
inactivation caused by p27 upregulation, the downregulation of cyclin B1 and 
Cdc2 phosphorylated at Thr161 and Tyr15; and (3) apoptosis by a 
caspase-dependent but mitochondria-independent pathway. Most importantly, the 
stimulation of EGCs with TNF-α plus IFN-γ before, concomitantly or after TcdB 
treatment strongly increased TcdB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, EGCs that 
survived the cytotoxic effect of TcdB did not recover completely and showed not 
only persistent Rac1 glucosylation, cell-cycle arrest and low apoptosis but also 
increased production of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting 
self-rescuing mechanisms. In conclusion, the high susceptibility of EGCs to TcdB 
in vitro, the increased sensitivity to inflammatory cytokines related to 
apoptosis and the persistence of altered functions in surviving cells suggest an 
important in vivo role of EGCs in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile toxins A and B and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium 
flagellin in a mouse model of Clostridium difficile disease.

Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacillus that produces toxin-mediated 
enteric disease. C. difficile expresses two major virulence factors, toxin A 
(TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). Human and animal studies demonstrate a clear 
association between humoral immunity to these toxins and protection against C. 
difficile infection (CDI). The receptor binding-domains (RBDs) of TcdA and TcdB 
are known to be immunogenic. Here, we tested the immunoadjuvant properties of 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC) subunit D1 as an innate 
immune agonist expressed as a recombinant fusion vaccine targeting the RBDs of 
TcdA and TcdB in mice. Intraperitoneally immunized mice developed prominent 
anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB immunoglobulin G in serum. The protective efficacy of 
the recombinant vaccines, with or without an adjuvant, was tested in a mouse 
model of CDI that closely represents the human disease. Following 
intraperitoneal immunization equivalent to two doses of toxoid A and toxoid B 
vaccine adjuvanted with alum and oral challenge with C. difficile VPI 10463, 
C57BL/6 mice were able to mount a protective immune response that prevented 
diarrhea and death compared to mice immunzed with alum alone. These results are 
significantly different from those for control mice (P < 0.001). These results 
provide evidence that a recombinant protein-based vaccine targeting the RBDs of 
the C. difficile toxins adjuvanted with S. Typhimurium flagellin can induce 
rapid, high-level protection in a mouse model of CDI when challenged with the 
homologous strain from which the vaccine antigens were derived and warrant 
further preclinical testing against clinically relevant C. difficile strains in 
the mouse and hamster models of CDI.

Clostridium difficile is recognized as an important cause of nosocomial 
diarrhoea in humans especially in association with administration of 
antibiotics. In pigs, C. difficile can cause neonatal enteritis and can be 
isolated from faeces from both diseased and healthy animals. The presented 
prospective study describes how soon C. difficile can be isolated from newborn 
piglets after normal parturition and how C. difficile spreads within a pig farm. 
Six sows, their farrowing crates and their litters at one farm were sampled 
until C. difficile was found in all piglets. Within 48 h after birth, all 71 
piglets became positive for C. difficile (two piglets were already positive 
within 1h post partum), all sows became positive within 113 h after parturition 
and the farrowing crates were found intermittently positive. C. difficile could 
also be detected in air samples and in samples of teats of the sows. All 
isolates belonged to PCR ribotype 078. Twenty-one C. difficile ribotype 078 
isolates, found at the farm, were further analyzed by MLVA (multiple-locus 
variable-number tandem repeat analysis) and belonged to one clonal complex, 
except one isolate. To be sure that piglets were not born already infected with 
C. difficile ribotype 078, 38 caesarean derived piglets were sampled immediately 
after surgery. All piglets tested negative at delivery and stayed negative for 
C. difficile ribotype 078 during the 21 days in which they were kept in sterile 
incubators. This study shows that C. difficile ribotype 078 spreads easily 
between sows, piglets and the environment. Vertical transmission of C. difficile 
ribotype 078 was not found and is very unlikely to occur.

BACKGROUND: Over the past several decades, there has been a significant increase 
in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in patients suffering 
from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, a wild-type animal model is not 
available to study these comorbid diseases.
METHODS: We evaluated the susceptibility to CDI of mice with dextran sulfate 
sodium salt (DSS)-induced colitis (IBD mice) with or without antibiotic 
exposure; we examined the histopathology and cytokine response in the 
concomitant diseases after the model was created.
RESULTS: No CDI occurs in healthy control mice, wherease the incidence of CDI in 
IBD mice is 40%; however, in IBD mice that received antibiotics, the incidence 
of CDI is 100% and the disease is accompanied by high levels of toxins in the 
mouse feces and sera. Compared to IBD and CDI alone, those IBD mice infected 
with C. difficile have more severe symptoms, toxemia, histopathological damage, 
and higher mortality. Moreover, several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
are significantly elevated in the colon tissues from IBD mice infected with C. 
difficile.
CONCLUSIONS: We, for the first time, demonstrate in an animal model that mice 
with dextran sulfate sodium induced-inflammatory bowel disease are significantly 
more susceptible to C. difficile infection, and that the bacterial infection led 
to more severe disease and death. These findings are consistent with clinical 
observations, thus, the animal model will permit us to study the pathogenesis of 
these concurrent diseases and to develop therapeutic strategies against the 
comorbidity of IBD and CDI.

Cats and dogs being treated at two veterinary clinics were investigated for 
gastrointestinal carriage of Clostridium difficile using selective solid and 
enrichment media. Thirty-two (39.5%) of 81 stool samples yielded C. difficile. 
There were significant differences in isolation rates between clinics, 61.0% of 
animals being positive at one clinic compared to 17.5% at the other (Chi-square, 
P less than 0.005). Of 29 animals receiving antibiotics, 15 (52.0%) harboured C. 
difficile while 11 (23.9%) of 46 animals not receiving antibiotics were positive 
(Chi-square, P less than 0.01). There was no difference in carriage rate between 
cats (38.1%) and dogs (40.0%). The environment at both veterinary clinics was 
surveyed for the presence of C. difficile. Fifteen of 20 sites at one clinic 
were positive compared to 6 of 14 sites at the other clinic. Both cytotoxigenic 
and noncytotoxigenic isolates of C. difficile were recovered from animals and 
environmental sites. These findings suggest that household pets may be a 
potentially significant reservoir of infection with C. difficile.

Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Probiotics might offer an attractive alternative for 
standard antibiotic therapy to treat Clostridium difficile infections (CDI). We 
specifically selected a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain for its high in vitro 
antibacterial activity against C. difficile and tested its efficacy to prevent 
CDI in a mouse model.
METHODS: B. amyloliquefaciens supernatant was tested against a large collection 
of C. difficile strains using an agar well diffusion test. B. amyloliquefaciens 
was orally administered to C57BL/6 mice in which CDI was induced using C. 
difficile VPI 10463, and its effect was compared with control mice receiving no 
treatment and mice receiving Saccharomyces boulardii. Mice were followed up 
daily for signs of disease including weight loss. At necropsy, the colon was 
collected and subjected to histopathological analysis. C. difficile toxin A/B 
levels and colon weight/length and colon/body weight ratios were calculated.
RESULTS: B. amyloliquefaciens supernatant was able to inhibit the growth of all 
C. difficile strains. Results of the in vivo trial indicated a significant 
weight loss for untreated and S. boulardii-treated mice as compared to B. 
amyloliquefaciens-treated mice. C. difficile toxin A and B levels were 
significantly higher for untreated and S. boulardii-treated mice than B. 
amyloliquefaciens-treated mice. A significantly lower degree of colon damage was 
detected for B. amyloliquefaciens-treated mice as compared to untreated and S. 
boulardii-treated mice, based on histopathological analysis, colon weight/length 
and colon/body weight ratios.
CONCLUSION: Administration of B. amyloliquefaciens was successful in preventing 
CDI in a mouse model.

Clostridium difficile toxins and enterococcal translocation in vivo and in 
vitro.

USA. felti001@tc.umn.edu

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxins alter permeability in cultured 
enterocytes and may alter intestinal epithelial permeability to bacteria in 
vivo. Experiments were designed to test the effects of C. difficile toxins on in 
vitro interactions of Enterococcus gallinarum with cultured enterocytes, as well 
as on translocation of E. gallinarum in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mature Caco-2 and HT-29 enterocytes were pretreated with 
C. difficile toxin A or toxin B followed by incubation with E. gallinarum. E. 
gallinarum-enterocyte interactions were assessed by quantitative culture. For in 
vivo experiments, antibiotic-treated mice were orally inoculated with C. 
difficile or saline, and all mice were orally inoculated 24 h later with E. 
gallinarum and sacrificed after another 24 h for analysis of cecal bacteria, 
cecal C. difficile toxin, and enterococcal translocation. Cecal C. difficile 
toxin was assayed as cytopathic effects on human foreskin fibroblasts.
RESULTS: Although neither toxin had a noticeable effect on bacterial 
internalization by cultured enterocytes, C. difficile toxins were associated 
with increased E. gallinarum transmigration across confluent enterocyte 
cultures. Mice orally inoculated with saline rather than C. difficile (n = 29) 
had no detectable cecal toxin, while mice orally inoculated with C. difficile (n 
= 30) had detectable cecal toxin. Viable E. gallinarum was recovered from the 
mesenteric lymph nodes of 97% of mice orally inoculated with saline followed by 
oral E. gallinarum, but only 37% of mice orally inoculated with C. difficile 
followed by oral E. gallinarum (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that observations with cultured 
enterocytes, demonstrating that C. difficile toxins facilitated bacterial 
migration across the intestinal epithelium, might have little in vivo relevance 
in a mouse model of antibiotic-induced C. difficile overgrowth.

AIM: To investigate the effect of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection 
in an interleukin 10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mouse model of inflammatory bowel 
disease.
METHODS: Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells isolated from wild type (WT) and 
IL-10(-/-)mice were stimulated for 4 h with C. difficile toxin A (200 μg/mL), 
and gene expression of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-12 and IL-23 was determined by 
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. WT and IL-10(-/-) 
mice (n = 20 each) were exposed to an antibiotic cocktail for three days and 
then were injected with clindamycin (i.p.). Mice (n = 10 WT, 10 IL-10(-/-)) were 
then challenged with oral administration of C. difficile (1 × 10(5) colony 
forming units of strain VPI 10463). Animals were monitored daily for 7 d for 
signs of colitis. Colonic tissue samples were evaluated for cytokine gene 
expression and histopathologic analysis.
RESULTS: C. difficile toxin A treatment induced IFN-γ gene expression to a level 
that was significantly higher in BDMCs from IL-10(-/-) compared to those from WT 
mice (P < 0.05). However, expression of IL-12 and IL-23 was not different among 
the groups. Following C. difficile administration, mice developed diarrhea and 
lost weight within 2-3 d. Weight loss was significantly greater in IL-10(-/-) 
compared to WT mice (P < 0.05). C. difficile infection induced histopathologic 
features typical of colitis in both IL-10(-/-) and WT mice. The histopathologic 
severity score was significantly higher in the IL-10(-/-) than in WT mice (mean 
± standard error; 5.50 ± 0.53 vs 2.44 ± 0.46; P < 0.05). This was accompanied by 
a significantly greater increase in IFN-γ gene expression in colonic tissues 
from IL-10(-/-) than from WT mice challenged with C. difficile (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that colitis is more severe after C. 
difficile infection in IL-10(-/-)mice, and that IFN-γ expression is involved in 
this process.

2-Aminoimidazole Molecules Against Clostridium difficile.

Antibiotics are considered to be the first line of treatment for mild to 
moderately severe Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in humans. However, 
antibiotics are also risk factors for CDI as they decrease colonization 
resistance against C. difficile by altering the gut microbiota and metabolome. 
Finding compounds that selectively inhibit different stages of the C. difficile 
life cycle, while sparing the indigenous gut microbiota is important for the 
development of alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment. 2-aminoimidazole 
(2-AI) molecules are known to disrupt bacterial protection mechanisms in 
antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter 
baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus, but are yet to be evaluated against C. 
difficile. A comprehensive small molecule-screening pipeline was developed to 
investigate how novel small molecules affect different stages of the C. 
difficile life cycle (growth, toxin, and sporulation) in vitro, and a library of 
commensal bacteria that are associated with colonization resistance against C. 
difficile. The initial screening tested the efficacy of eleven 2-AI molecules 
(compound 1 through 11) against C. difficile R20291 compared to a vancomycin (2 
μg/ml) control. Molecules were selected for their ability to inhibit C. 
difficile growth, toxin activity, and sporulation. Further testing included 
growth inhibition of other C. difficile strains (CD196, M68, CF5, 630, BI9, 
M120) belonging to distinct PCR ribotypes, and a commensal panel (Bacteroides 
fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, C. scindens, C. hylemonae, Lactobacillus 
acidophilus, L. gasseri, Escherichia coli, B. longum subsp. infantis). Three 
molecules compound 1 and 2, and 3 were microbicidal, whereas compounds 4, 7, 9, 
and 11 inhibited toxin activity without affecting the growth of C. difficile 
strains and the commensal microbiota. The antimicrobial and anti-toxin effects 
of 2-AI molecules need to be further characterized for mode of action and 
validated in a mouse model of CDI.

PURPOSE: Mouse model experiments have demonstrated an increased Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI) severity with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs 
(NSAIDs) use. We aim to evaluate the impact of NSAIDs in humans after a 
diagnosis of CDI on primary outcomes defined as I) all-cause mortality and II) 
toxic mega-colon attributable to CDI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of CDI were 
divided into two groups; those with NSAIDs administered up to 10 days after 
onset of CDI versus no NSAIDs use. The primary outcomes were analyzed between 
the groups, while controlling for severity of CDI. A logistic regression 
analysis was performed to identify the predictors of worse outcomes.
RESULTS: NSAIDs were administered in 14% (n=80) of the 568 hospitalized visits 
for an average of 2.5 days after the CDI diagnosis. All-cause mortality was high 
in patients who did not receive NSAIDs as compared to those who did receive 
NSAIDs (16.6% vs 12.5%, p 0.354). Patients who were prescribed NSAIDs were more 
likely to have toxic mega-colon as compared to those who were not prescribed 
NSAIDs (2.5% vs 0.6%, p 0.094). Results were not statistically significant, even 
after controlling for CDI severity. Logistic regression analysis did not 
identify NSAIDs administration as a significant factor for all-cause mortality 
in CDI patients.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study results, contrary to mouse model, did not 
show association between NSAID use and CDI related mortality and toxic 
mega-colon. Shorter duration of NSAIDs use, younger people in study group, and 
timely CDI treatment may have resulted in contrasting results.

Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the 
United States. The primary virulence factors are two homologous 
glucosyltransferase toxins, TcdA and TcdB, that inactivate host Rho-family 
GTPases. The glucosyltransferase activity has been linked to a "cytopathic" 
disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to the disruption of tight 
junctions and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TcdB is also a 
potent cytotoxin that causes epithelium necrotic damage through an NADPH oxidase 
(NOX)-dependent mechanism. We conducted a small molecule screen to identify 
compounds that confer protection against TcdB-induced necrosis. We identified an 
enrichment of "hit compounds" with a dihydropyridine (DHP) core which led to the 
discovery of a key early stage calcium signal that serves as a mechanistic link 
between TcdB-induced NOX activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production. Disruption of TcdB-induced calcium signaling (with both DHP and 
non-DHP molecules) is sufficient to ablate ROS production and prevent subsequent 
necrosis in cells and in a mouse model of intoxication.

immunoglobulin receptor-deficient mice.

Clostridium difficile rivals methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the 
primary hospital-acquired infection. C. difficile infection (CDI) caused by 
toxins A and/or B can manifest as mild diarrhea to life-threatening 
pseudomembranous colitis. Although most patients recover fully from CDI, ~20% 
undergo recurrent disease. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation 
between anti-toxin antibody (Ab) and decreased recurrence; however, the 
contributions of the systemic and mucosal Ab responses remain unclear. Our goal 
was to use the CDI mouse model to characterize the protective immune response to 
C. difficile. C57BL/6 mice infected with epidemic C. difficile strain BI17 
developed protective immunity against CDI and did not develop CDI upon 
rechallenge; they generated systemic IgG and IgA as well as mucosal IgA Ab to 
toxin. To determine if protective immunity to C. difficile could be generated in 
immunodeficient individuals, we infected CD4(-/-) mice and found that they 
generated both mucosal and serum IgA anti-toxin Abs and were protected from CDI 
upon rechallenge, with protection dependent on major histocompatibility complex 
class II (MHCII) expression; no IgG anti-toxin Ab was found. We found that 
protection was likely due to neutralizing mucosal IgA Ab. In contrast, pIgR(-/-) 
mice, which lack the receptor to transcytose polymeric Ab across the epithelium, 
were also protected from CDI, suggesting that although mucosal anti-toxin Ab may 
contribute to protection, it is not required. We conclude that protection from 
CDI can occur by several mechanisms and that the mechanism of protection is 
determined by the state of immunocompetence of the host.

United Kingdom.

Clostridia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and 
animals. Some of the most common clostridial infections are those of the gut. 
The primary infections in humans are Clostridium perfringens food poisoning and 
Clostridium difficile-mediated antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Less 
common but important infections include non-food poisoning C. perfringens 
nosocomial diarrhea and C. perfringens type C necrotizing jejunitis (pig-bel). 
C. perfringens is also the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in 
animals, although Clostridium septicum causing braxy in sheep, Clostridium 
colinum causing ulcerative enteritis is avian species, and Clostridium 
spiroforme causing enterotoxemia in rabbits are important exceptions.

Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens are anaerobic, Gram-positive 
bacilli that are common causes of enteritis and enterotoxemias in both domestic 
animals and humans. Both organisms have been associated with acute and chronic 
large and small bowel diarrhea, and acute hemorrhagic diarrheal syndrome in the 
dog. The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial 
susceptibilities of canine C. difficile and C. perfringens isolates in an effort 
to optimize antimicrobial therapy for dogs with clostridial-associated diarrhea. 
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics recommended for 
treating C. difficile (metronidazole, vancomycin) and C. perfringens-associated 
diarrhea in the dog (ampicillin, erythromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, 
tylosin) were determined for 70 canine fecal C. difficile isolates and 131 C. 
perfringens isolates. All C. difficile isolates tested had an MIC of <or=1 for 
both metronidazole and vancomycin. Ninety-five percent (124/131) of C. 
perfringens isolates tested had an MIC for ampicillin of <or=0.125 microg/ml. 
Two C. perfringens isolates had an MIC of >or=256 microg/ml for both 
erythromycin and tylosin. A third C. perfringens isolate had an MIC of 32 
microg/ml for metronidazole. Based on the results of this study, ampicillin, 
erythromycin, metronidazole, and tylosin appear to be effective antibiotics for 
the treatment of C. perfringens-associated diarrhea, although resistant strains 
do exist. However, because there is limited information regarding breakpoints 
for veterinary anaerobes, and because intestinal concentrations are not known, 
in vitro results should be interpreted with caution.

A total of 250 fecal content samples were collected from 25 farrow-to-finish pig 
farms and examined for the prevalence of Clostridium difficile by using ethanol 
treatment followed by plating onto selective 
media--cycloserine-cefoxitin-mannitol agar--for the isolation of Clostridium 
difficile. Two specimens (0.8%, 95% confidential interval: 0-2.9%) were positive 
for C. difficile. One isolate was only positive for toxin B, and the other 
isolate was negative for both toxins A and B. Thus, prevalence of Clostridium 
difficile was found to be low among finishing pigs in Japan.

OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) caused by C. difficile is one 
of the most common nosocomial infections, however, little is known about 
infections related to antimicrobial use for pathogens other than C. difficile. 
We therefore aimed to provide insight into other bacterial causes of AAD, and 
how infection with these pathogens causes damage in the dysbiotic gut.
METHODS: Clinical isolates from C. difficile-negative AAD patients were whole 
genome sequenced for in silico analysis of potential virulence factors and 
antimicrobial resistance determinants. A mouse model of infection was developed 
to assess the capacity of these isolates to cause gastrointestinal damage, which 
was analysed by studying specific markers in the gastrointestinal mucosa of 
infected mice.
RESULTS: Several bacterial pathogens were isolated from patients with C. 
difficile-negative AAD. Each isolate showed the potential for virulence based on 
encoded virulence factors, as well as most showing antimicrobial resistance in 
vitro. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae were tested in the mouse model of infection, inducing damage 
primarily in the small intestine, affecting adherens junction integrity, 
cellular polarity, and cellular proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Several pathogens of clinical importance other than C. difficile 
are able to cause gastrointestinal infection following antimicrobial-mediated 
dysbiosis. The virulence potential and multidrug resistance identified in these 
isolates illuminates the importance of further diagnostic screening in cases of 
C. difficile-negative AAD.

Fate of ingested Clostridium difficile spores in mice.

Author information:

United States of America.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a major nosocomial complication. The infective 
form of C. difficile is the spore, a dormant and resistant structure that forms 
under stress. Although spore germination is the first committed step in CDI 
onset, the temporal and spatial distribution of ingested C. difficile spores is 
not clearly understood. We recently reported that CamSA, a synthetic bile salt 
analog, inhibits C. difficile spore germination in vitro and in vivo. In this 
study, we took advantage of the anti-germination activity of bile salts to 
determine the fate of ingested C. difficile spores. We tested four different 
bile salts for efficacy in preventing CDI. Since CamSA was the only 
anti-germinant tested able to prevent signs of CDI, we characterized CamSa's in 
vitro stability, distribution, and cytotoxicity. We report that CamSA is stable 
to simulated gastrointestinal (GI) environments, but will be degraded by members 
of the natural microbiota found in a healthy gut. Our data suggest that CamSA 
will not be systemically available, but instead will be localized to the GI 
tract. Since in vitro pharmacological parameters were acceptable, CamSA was used 
to probe the mouse model of CDI. By varying the timing of CamSA dosage, we 
estimated that C. difficile spores germinated and established infection less 
than 10 hours after ingestion. We also showed that ingested C. difficile spores 
rapidly transited through the GI tract and accumulated in the colon and cecum of 
CamSA-treated mice. From there, C. difficile spores were slowly shed over a 
96-hour period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using molecular 
probes to obtain disease progression information for C. difficile infection.

Freezing donor fecal microbiota has simplified fecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI). However, the 
optimal storage time for the frozen FMT products remains unknown. Using an 
established murine model of CDI, stability and efficacy of frozen and 
lyophilized FMT product was studied at time points from 2 months to 15 months. 
DNA was extracted from fecal samples from the mice with identification of 
specific bacterial species by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). FMT product 
stability and efficacy were measured by occurrence of diarrhea in the challenged 
mice together with stability of the microbiota composition. The results were 
analyzed and compared by SAS statistical software. All mice treated with only 
C. difficile developed diarrhea within 72 h. Mice treated with frozen 
(n = 5/group), lyophilized (n = 5/group) products stored for ≤ 7-month or fresh 
FMT product (n = 22) were protected from post C. difficile challenge diarrhea. 
There was no difference between frozen and lyophilized products (n = 5/group) 
stored for ≤ 7 months 95% CI 1.00 (0.38-2.64) and 1.00 (0.38-2.64), 
respectively. Prevention if CDI by frozen and lyophilized product was not 
different for storage of 9-, 11- and 15-months. qPCR results demonstrated there 
were no significant quantitative change in Bacteroides and Clostridium species 
during any of the storage times (P > 0.05). In the present study, frozen and 
lyophilized FMT products were stored up to 7 months without losing microbiota 
composition and therapeutic efficacy. The animal model described may be useful 
to study stability of human microbiota designed for FMT.

As a consequence of excessive antibiotic therapies in hospitalized patients, 
Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming intestinal 
pathogen, is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis. Drug 
treatments for these diseases are often complicated by antibiotic-resistant 
strains and a high frequency of treatment failures and relapse; therefore, novel 
nonantibiotic approaches may prove to be more effective. In this study, we 
recombinantly expressed a prophage lysin identified from a C. difficile strain, 
CD630, which we named PlyCD. PlyCD was found to have lytic activity against 
specific C. difficile strains. However, the recombinantly expressed catalytic 
domain of this protein, PlyCD1-174, displayed significantly greater lytic 
activity (>4-log kill) and a broader lytic spectrum against C. difficile strains 
while still retaining a high degree of specificity toward C. difficile versus 
commensal clostridia and other bacterial species. Our data also indicated that 
noneffective doses of vancomycin and PlyCD1-174 when combined in vitro could be 
significantly more bactericidal against C. difficile. In an ex vivo treatment 
model of mouse colon infection, we found that PlyCD1-174 functioned in the 
presence of intestinal contents, significantly decreasing colonizing C. 
difficile compared to controls. Together, these data suggest that PlyCD1-174 has 
potential as a novel therapeutic for clinical application against C. difficile 
infection, either alone or in combination with other preexisting treatments to 
improve their efficacy.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), an enterobacteria, flourishes and produces 
potent toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), after the disruption of the 
normal colonic microbiota by antibiotic therapy. C. difficile infection (CDI) 
may induce life-threatening complications such as fulminant colitis through 
damage of the intestinal wall by the toxins, therefore the prevention of CDI 
recurrence is the most important in CDI treatment. Bezlotoxumab is a human 
monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the activity of TcdB directly. The antibody 
inhibited cytotoxicity by TcdB derived from various ribotypes of C. difficile at 
a concentration (EC50) of 1/150 or less of the serum concentration (Cmax: 
169 μg/mL) in CDI patients at the clinical dose. Moreover the anti-cytotoxicity 
effects of the antibody were also observed against 81 clinically isolated C. 
difficile strains (incl. 018 [smz] and 369 [trf]: Japanese prevalent ribotypes; 
027: hypervirulent ribotype) obtained in Japan and western countries. The 
antibody prolonged survival time of hamster and rat CDI models in a 
dose-dependent manner. In clinical phase III studies (MODIFY I and II), the 
recurrence rate of CDI up to 12 weeks after administration of the bezlotoxumab 
group was significantly lower (P<0.0001) than the placebo group. Bezlotoxumab is 
the world's first drug with an indication for reduce recurrence of CDI. In 
Japan, bezlotoxumab was approved for marketing in September, and launched in 
December in 2017. Bezlotoxumab is effective for broad ribotypes of C. difficile, 
therefore it expects to contribute to CDI treatment through the reduce 
recurrence of the CDI.

BACKGROUND: The elderly host is highly susceptible to severe disease and 
treatment failure in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We investigated how 
treatment with vancomycin in the aged host influences systemic and intestinal 
humoral responses and select intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: Young (age, 2 months) and aged (age, 18 months) C57BL/6 mice were 
infected with VPI 10463 after exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Vancomycin 
was given 24 hours after infection, and treatment was continued for 5 days. At 
select time points, specimens of serum and intestinal tissue and contents were 
collected for histopathologic analysis, to measure antibody levels and the 
pathogen burden, and to determine the presence and levels of select intestinal 
microbiota and C. difficile toxin.
RESULTS: Levels of disease severity, relapse, and mortality were increased, and 
recovery from infection was slower in aged mice compared to young mice. Serum 
levels of immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin G against C. 
difficile toxin A were depressed in aged mice, and vancomycin treatment reduced 
antibody responses in both age groups. While baseline levels of total bacterial 
load, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Enterobacteriaceae were mostly similar, 
aged mice had a significant change in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio with 
vancomycin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin treatment decreases the systemic humoral response to 
CDI. Increased mortality from and recurrence of CDI in the aged host are 
associated with an impaired humoral response and a greater susceptibility to 
vancomycin-induced alteration of intestinal microbiota.

Vancomycin taper regimens are commonly used for the treatment of recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infections. One rationale for tapering and pulsing of the 
dose at the end of therapy is to reduce the selective pressure of vancomycin on 
the indigenous intestinal microbiota. Here, we used a mouse model to test the 
hypothesis that the indigenous microbiota that provide colonization resistance 
against C. difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is repopulated 
during tapering courses of vancomycin. Mice were treated orally with vancomycin 
daily for 10 days, vancomycin in a tapering dose for 42 days, fidaxomicin for 10 
days, or saline. To assess colonization resistance, subsets of mice were 
challenged with 104 CFU of C. difficile or VRE at multiple time points during 
and after completion of treatment. The impact of the treatments on the 
microbiome was measured by cultures, real-time PCR for selected anaerobic 
bacteria, and deep sequencing. Vancomycin taper-treated mice developed 
alterations of the microbiota and disruption of colonization resistance that was 
persistent 18 days after treatment. In contrast, mice treated with a 10-day 
course of vancomycin exhibited recovery of the microbiota and of colonization 
resistance by 15 days after treatment, and fidaxomicin-treated mice maintained 
intact colonization resistance. These findings demonstrate that alteration of 
the indigenous microbiota responsible for colonization resistance to C. 
difficile and VRE persist during and after completion of tapering courses of 
vancomycin.

Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium that is known to be a cause 
of enteric diseases in humans. It is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Recently, large outbreaks of C. 
difficile-associated diarrhea have been reported internationally, and there have 
been reports of increases in severe disease, mortality and relapse rates. At the 
moment, there is no vaccine against C. difficile, and the medical prevention of 
C. difficile infection is mostly based on the prophylactic use of antibiotics; 
however, this has led to an increase in the incidence of the disease. Here, we 
describe the chemical structure of C. difficile cell-surface polysaccharides. 
The polysaccharides of three C. difficile strains were structurally analyzed; 
ribotype 027 (North American pulsotype 1) strain was observed to express two 
polysaccharides, one was composed of a branched pentaglycosyl phosphate 
repeating unit: 
[-->4)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-[alpha-l-Rhap-(1-->3]-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->P] 
and the other was composed of a hexaglycosyl phosphate repeating unit: 
[-->6)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1-->]-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1-->P]. 
The latter polysaccharide was also observed to be produced by strains MOH900 and 
MOH718. The results described here represent the first literature report 
describing the covalent chemical structures of C. difficile cell-surface 
polysaccharides, of which PS-II appears to be a regular C. difficile antigen. 
These C. difficile teichoic-acid-like polysaccharides will be tested as 
immunogens in vaccine preparations in a rat and horse model.

As the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile is a 
serious problem in health care facilities worldwide. C. difficile produces two 
large toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which are the primary virulence factors in disease. 
The respective functions of these toxins have been difficult to discern, in part 
because the cytotoxicity profiles for these toxins differ with concentration and 
cell type. The goal of this study was to develop a cell culture model that would 
allow a side-by-side mechanistic comparison of the toxins. Conditionally 
immortalized, young adult mouse colonic (YAMC) epithelial cells demonstrate an 
exquisite sensitivity to both toxins with phenotypes that agree with 
observations in tissue explants. TcdA intoxication results in an apoptotic cell 
death that is dependent on the glucosyltransferase activity of the toxin. In 
contrast, TcdB has a bimodal mechanism; it induces apoptosis in a 
glucosyltransferase-dependent manner at lower concentrations and 
glucosyltransferase-independent necrotic death at higher concentrations. The 
direct comparison of the responses to TcdA and TcdB in cells and colonic 
explants provides the opportunity to unify a large body of observations made by 
many independent investigators.

Clostridium difficile (CD), Salmonella, Campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic 
Escherichia coli (EHEC) are major causes of morbidity in a variety of enteric 
diseases in humans and animals, but subclinical carriage in both is probably 
more common than are clinical cases. Little is known regarding the prevalence of 
these pathogens in animals raised for exhibit at Michigan county fairs or the 
frequency with which Michigan citizens raising these animals may have been 
subclinically colonized. To address these issues, 361 fecal specimens from 158 
humans and 203 of their farm animals were cultured for CD, Salmonella and 
Campylobacter. Additionally, 50 people and their cattle were tested for EHEC. No 
EHEC, Salmonella or Campylobacter were detected. However, 16 specimens (4.4%) 
were positive for CD: 13 humans, two horses and one pig. None of the farm animal 
specimens submitted by any of the 13 CD-positive humans were positive for CD. 
Strain characterization [toxinotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)] 
demonstrated that the human CD isolates were similar to what has been reported 
previously in the general US population. We conclude that horses and farm 
animals (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) at 1-2 months before market weight 
showed no evidence of wide-spread carriage of the common enteric pathogens, 
including the recently reported CD toxinotype V. These results provide no 
support to the hypothesis that 4-H members or others visiting county fair animal 
husbandry projects in these counties may be at increased risk for acquisition of 
CD, Salmonella, Campylobacter or EHEC from animals.

BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the 
underlying causes are poorly understood.
HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile 
Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs.
ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs.
METHODS: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 
80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, 
mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by 
ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, 
Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were 
detected via immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal 
mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated 
from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. 
perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before 
racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to 
test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P = .021); 
however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly 
associated with hematochezia or diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sled dogs participating in long distance 
racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not 
associated with common enteropathogens. It is possible that diarrhea and 
hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal 
tract.

Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a key virulence factor of bacterium and 
induces intestinal inflammatory disease. Because of its potent cytotoxic and 
proinflammatory activities, we investigated the utility of TcdB in developing 
anti-tumor immunity. TcdB induced cell death in mouse colorectal cancer CT26 
cells, and the intoxicated cells stimulated the activation of mouse bone 
marrow-derived dendritic cells and subsequent T cell activation in vitro. 
Immunization of BALB/c mice with toxin-treated CT26 cells elicited potent 
anti-tumor immunity that protected mice from a lethal challenge of the same 
tumor cells and rejected pre-injected tumors. The anti-tumor immunity generated 
was cell-mediated, long-term, and tumor-specific. Further experiments 
demonstrated that the intact cell bodies were important for the immunogenicity 
since lysing the toxin-treated tumor cells reduced their ability to induce 
antitumor immunity. Finally, we showed that TcdB is able to induce potent 
anti-tumor immunity in B16-F10 melanoma model. Taken together, these data 
demonstrate the utility of C. difficile toxin B for developing anti-tumor 
immunity.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the main cause of 
nosocomial antibiotic-associated colitis and increased incidence of 
community-associated diarrhea in industrialized countries. At present, the 
primary treatment of CDI is antibiotic administration, which is effective but 
often associated with recurrence, especially in the elderly. Pathogenic strains 
produce enterotoxin, toxin A (TcdA), and cytotoxin, toxin B (TcdB), which are 
necessary for C. difficile induced diarrhea and gut pathological changes. 
Administration of anti-toxin antibodies provides an alternative approach to 
treat CDI, and has shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. 
In the current study, several humanized anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB monoclonal 
antibodies were generated and their protective potency was characterized in a 
hamster infection model. The humanized anti-TcdA (CANmAbA4) and anti-TcdB 
(CANmAbB4 and CANmAbB1) antibodies showed broad spectrum in vitro neutralization 
of toxins from clinical strains and neutralization in a mouse toxin challenge 
model. Moreover, co-administration of humanized antibodies (CANmAbA4 and 
CANmAbB4 cocktail) provided a high level of protection in a dose dependent 
manner (85% versus 57% survival at day 22 for 50 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses, 
respectively) in a hamster gastrointestinal infection (GI) model. This study 
describes the protective effects conferred by novel neutralizing anti-toxin 
monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins and their potential as 
therapeutic agents in treating CDI.

Most pathogenic Clostridium difficile produce two major exotoxins TcdA and TcdB, 
in the absence of which the bacterium is non-pathogenic. While it is important 
to investigate the role of each toxin in the pathogenesis of C. difficile 
infection (CDI) using isogenic strains, it is impossible to precisely control 
the expression levels of individual toxins and exclude bacterial factors that 
may contribute to the toxins' effects during infection. In this study, we 
utilized an acute intestinal disease model by injecting purified toxins directly 
into mouse cecum after a midline laparotomy. We evaluated the physical condition 
of mice by clinical score and survival, and the intestinal tissue damage and 
inflammation by histology. Depending on the dose of the toxins, mice developed 
mild to severe colitis, experienced diarrhea or rapidly died. We found that both 
purified TcdA and TcdB were able to induce clinical disease, intestinal 
inflammation, and tissue damage that resembled CDI. TcdA was significantly 
faster in inducing intestinal inflammation and tissue damage, and was 
approximately five times more potent than TcdB in terms of inducing severe gut 
disease and death outcomes in mice. Moreover, we found that the two toxins had 
significant synergistic effects on disease induction. Comparison of the in vivo 
toxicity of TcdB from clinical strains revealed that TcdB from an epidemic RT 
027 strain was more toxic than the others. Our study thus demonstrates that both 
TcdA and TcdB, independent of other factors from C. difficile bacterium, are 
able to cause disease that resembles CDI and highlights the importance of 
targeting both toxins for vaccines and therapeutics against the disease.

The impact of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on healthcare is becoming 
increasingly recognized as it represents a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea. A 
rising number of CDI cases and outbreaks have been reported worldwide. Here, we 
developed the pig ileal-ligated loop model for semi-quantitative analysis 
comparing temporal differential proteomes in C. difficile following in vivo 
incubation with in vitro growth using isobaric tags for relative and absolute 
quantification (iTRAQ). Proteins retrieved from the in vitro cultures and the 
loop contents after 4, 8, and 12 h in vivo incubation were subjected to 
in-solution digestion, iTRAQ labeling, two-dimensional liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and statistical analyses. From a total 
of 1152 distinct proteins identified in this study, 705 proteins were available 
for quantitative measures at all time points in both biological and technical 
replicates; 109 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. With 
analysis of clusters of orthologous group and protein-protein network 
interactions, we identified the proteins that might play roles in adaptive 
responses to the host environment, hence enhancing pathogenicity during CDI. 
This report represents the quantitative proteomic analysis of C. difficile that 
demonstrates time-dependent protein expression changes under conditions that 
mimic in vivo infection and identifies potential candidates for diagnostic or 
therapeutic measures.

Tigecycline exhibits inhibitory activity against Clostridium difficile in the 
colon of mice and does not promote growth or toxin production.

Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic with potent in vitro 
activity against Clostridium difficile. We used a mouse model to test the 
hypothesis that tigecycline has a low propensity to promote colonization and 
toxin production by C. difficile due to inhibitory activity in the colon. Mice 
(5 to 8 per group) received subcutaneous injections of tigecycline (low and high 
doses) alone or in combination with clindamycin for 6 days. Growth of and toxin 
production by 3 strains of C. difficile (tigecycline MICs ≤ 0.012 μg/ml) were 
measured in cecal contents collected 6 h or 3 days after the final antibiotic 
dose. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using a bioassay, and 
concentrations of total anaerobes and Bacteroides spp. were measured. The 
effects of tigecycline on rendering mice susceptible to colonization with and 
reducing the burden of C. difficile were also examined. In comparison to saline 
controls, clindamycin promoted the growth of C. difficile (P < 0.001) in cecal 
contents, whereas tigecycline did not. Tigecycline did not suppress total 
anaerobes or Bacteroides spp. in comparison to saline controls. Concurrent 
administration of tigecycline prevented clindamycin-induced promotion of C. 
difficile in cecal contents collected 6 h or 3 days (high dose only) after the 
final antibiotic dose. Tigecycline did not promote the establishment of 
colonization in mice, yet it did not reduce concentrations of C. difficile in 
animals with established colonization. In summary, tigecycline did not promote 
the growth of or toxin production by C. difficile, probably due to inhibitory 
activity against C. difficile and relative sparing of indigenous anaerobic 
microflora.

Clostridium difficile infections are associated with the use of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics and result in an exuberant inflammatory response, leading to 
nosocomial diarrhea, colitis and even death. To better understand the dynamics 
of mucosal immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through 
expansion to resolution, we built a computational model of the mucosal immune 
response to the bacterium. The model was calibrated using data from a mouse 
model of C. difficile infection. The model demonstrates a crucial role of T 
helper 17 (Th17) effector responses in the colonic lamina propria and luminal 
commensal bacteria populations in the clearance of C. difficile and colonic 
pathology, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells responses are associated with the 
recovery phase. In addition, the production of anti-microbial peptides by 
inflamed epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C. difficile 
infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial commensal bacterial species. 
Computational simulations suggest that the removal of neutrophil and epithelial 
cell derived anti-microbial inhibitions, separately and together, on commensal 
bacterial regrowth promote recovery and minimize colonic inflammatory pathology. 
Simulation results predict a decrease in colonic inflammatory markers, such as 
neutrophilic influx and Th17 cells in the colonic lamina propria, and length of 
infection with accelerated commensal bacteria re-growth through altered 
anti-microbial inhibition. Computational modeling provides novel insights on the 
therapeutic value of repopulating the colonic microbiome and inducing regulatory 
mucosal immune responses during C. difficile infection. Thus, modeling mucosal 
immunity-gut microbiota interactions has the potential to guide the development 
of targeted fecal transplantation therapies in the context of precision medicine 
interventions.

Clostridium difficile is an important enteric pathogen of humans and the cause 
of diarrhea and enteritis in neonatal pigs. Outside Australia, prevalence in 
piglets can be up to 73%, with a single PCR ribotype (RT), 078, predominating. 
We investigated the prevalence and genotype of C. difficile in Australian pig 
herds. Rectal swabs (n = 229) were collected from piglets aged <7 days from 21 
farms across Australia. Selective culture for C. difficile was performed and 
isolates characterized by PCR for toxin genes and PCR ribotyping. C. difficile 
was isolated from 52% of samples by direct culture on chromogenic agar and 67% 
by enrichment culture (P = 0.001). No association between C. difficile recovery 
or genotype and diarrheic status of either farm or piglets was found. The 
majority (87%; 130/154) of isolates were toxigenic. Typing revealed 23 different 
RTs, several of which are known to cause disease in humans, including RT014, 
which was isolated most commonly (23%; 36/154). RT078 was not detected. This 
study shows that colonization of Australian neonatal piglets with C. difficile 
is widespread in the herds sampled.

BACKGROUND: The glycylcycline antibiotic tigecycline may have a relatively low 
propensity to promote Clostridium difficile infection in part because it causes 
less disruption of the indigenous intestinal microbiota than other 
broad-spectrum antibiotics. We used a mouse model to compare the effects of 
tigecycline versus other commonly used antibiotics on colonization resistance to 
C. difficile and on the metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: To assess in vivo colonization resistance to C. difficile, mice were 
challenged with oral C. difficile spores 1, 7, or 12 days after completion of 3 
days of treatment with subcutaneous saline, tigecycline, ceftriaxone, 
piperacillin-tazobactam, or linezolid. Levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal 
specimens of mice treated with the same antibiotics were analyzed using 
non-targeted metabolic profiling by gas chromatograph (GC)/mass spectrometry 
(MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS (UPLC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: All of the antibiotics disrupted colonization resistance to C. 
difficile when challenge occurred 2 days after treatment. Only 
piperacillin/tazobactam mice had disturbed colonization resistance at 7 days 
after treatment. All of the antibiotics altered fecal metabolites in comparison 
to controls, but tigecycline caused significantly less alteration than the other 
antibiotics, including less suppression of multiple amino acids, bile acids, and 
lipid metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline, linezolid, and ceftriaxone caused transient disruption 
of colonization resistance to C. difficile, whereas piperacillin/tazobactam 
caused disruption that persisted for 7 days post-treatment. Tigecycline caused 
less profound alteration of fecal bacterial metabolites than the other 
antibiotics, suggesting that the relatively short period of disruption of 
colonization resistance might be related in part to reduced alteration of the 
metabolic functions of the microbiota.

DS-2969b, a novel GyrB inhibitor, transiently and reversibly altered the counts 
of limited intestinal microbiota at around 10 μg/g of faecal levels in rats and 
monkeys. Considering the high activity of DS-2969b against Clostridium 
difficile, 10 μg/g of faecal levels would be sufficient for clearing 
C. difficile from the intestine.

The presence and characteristics of Clostridium difficile were investigated in 
839 faecal samples from seven different animal species in the Netherlands. The 
number of positive samples ranged from 3.4% (cattle) to 25.0% (dogs). Twenty-two 
different PCR ribotypes were identified. Among 96 isolates, 53% harboured toxin 
genes. All C. difficile isolates from pigs, cattle and poultry were toxinogenic, 
whereas the majority of isolates from pet animals consisted of non-toxinogenic 
PCR ribotypes 010 and 039. Ribotype 012 was most prevalent in cattle and 
ribotype 078 in pigs. No predominant ribotypes were present in horse and poultry 
samples. Overall, PCR ribotypes 012, 014 and 078 were the most frequently 
recovered toxinogenic ribotypes from animal samples. Comparison with human 
isolates from the Dutch Reference Laboratory for C. difficile at Leiden 
University Medical Centre (LUMC) showed that these types were also recovered 
from human hospitalized patients in 2009/2010, encompassing 0.8%, 11.4% and 9.8% 
of all isolates, respectively. Application of multiple-locus variable-number 
tandem-repeat analysis indicated a genotypic relation of animal and human 
ribotype 078 strains, but a clear genotypic distinction for ribotypes 012 and 
014. We conclude that toxinogenic C. difficile PCR ribotypes found in animals 
correspond to PCR ribotypes associated with human disease in hospitalized 
patients in the Netherlands. Contrary to PCR ribotype 078, significant genetic 
differences were observed between animal and human PCR ribotype 012 and 014 
isolates.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Immunosuppressive therapy may precipitate Clostridium 
difficile associated disease (CDAD). We evaluated the role of cyclosporin in the 
development of CDAD in the experimental mouse model and studied the effect of 
probiotic and epidermal growth factor (EGF) as biotherapeutics measures.
METHODS: BALB/c mice (n = 24) were divided into four groups. Group I animals not 
given any inoculum served as controls. Animals in the remaining three groups 
(Group II, III and IV) were given cyclosporin daily from days 1-7 followed by C. 
difficile inoculum on day 8. Additionally, the animals received Lactobacillus 
acidophilus (Group III) and EGF (Group IV) for one-week post C. difficile 
challenge. The animals were evaluated for colonization and toxin production by 
C. difficile, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histopathological changes.
RESULTS: Clostridium difficile was colonized and elaborated its toxins in 
animals receiving cyclosporin and C. difficile. MPO activity was significantly 
higher (P < 0.05) and histopathological epithelial damage, cryptitis and acute 
inflammatory changes were seen in the cecum and colon. C. difficile count, 
toxins A and B titers and MPO activity were significantly lowered (P < 0.05) in 
animals receiving probiotic and EGF. Histopathologically, mucodepletion and 
inflammatory infiltrate were decreased in the biotherapeutic receiving animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin led to the development of mild to moderate CDAD in 
animals. Administration of biotherapeutics reduced the severity of CDAD. Future 
clinical trials are needed for further investigation of these potential 
biotherapeutic measures.

Clostridium difficile causes mucosal damage and diarrhea by releasing two 
exotoxins: toxin A and toxin B. C. difficile colitis is associated with 
alterations in bowel flora and the failure to mount an effective antibody 
response. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether antitoxin sera 
prevent toxin-A-induced apoptosis, cytoskeletal disaggregation, cell detachment, 
and tight junction loss in cultured colonic epithelial cells. Serum samples were 
isolated from mice that survived a C. difficile infection following antibiotic 
treatment, and the antitoxin effects of these samples were investigated in 
toxin-A-exposed HT29 colonic epithelial cells and a toxin-A-induced animal model 
of gut inflammation. Unchallenged mice did not produce IgG against toxin A, 
whereas serum (antiserum) from C. difficile-challenged mice showed significant 
IgG responses against toxin A. Treatment with the antiserum markedly inhibited 
mucosal damage and inflammation in the toxin-A-treated mouse model. In contrast 
to control mouse serum, the antiserum also markedly inhibited toxin-A-induced 
DNA fragmentation, dephosphorylation of paxillin and Epo receptor (EpoR), 
deacetylation of tubulin, and upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53. Taken 
together, these results reveal that the generated antitoxin serum has 
biotherapeutic effects in preventing various C. difficile toxin-A-induced 
cellular toxicities.

Inducible Expression of spo0A as a Universal Tool for Studying Sporulation in 
Clostridium difficile.

Clostridium difficile remains a leading nosocomial pathogen, putting 
considerable strain on the healthcare system. The ability to form endospores, 
highly resistant to environmental insults, is key to its persistence and 
transmission. However, important differences exist between the sporulation 
pathways of C. difficile and the model Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis. 
Amongst the challenges in studying sporulation in C. difficile is the relatively 
poor levels of sporulation and high heterogeneity in the sporulation process. To 
overcome these limitations we placed Ptet regulatory elements upstream of the 
master regulator of sporulation, spo0A, generating a new strain that can be 
artificially induced to sporulate by addition of anhydrotetracycline (ATc). We 
demonstrate that this strain is asporogenous in the absence of ATc, and that ATc 
can be used to drive faster and more efficient sporulation. Induction of Spo0A 
is titratable and this can be used in the study of the spo0A regulon both in 
vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated using a mouse model of C. difficile infection 
(CDI). Insights into differences between the sporulation pathways in B. subtilis 
and C. difficile gained by study of the inducible strain are discussed, further 
highlighting the universal interest of this tool. The Ptet-spo0A strain provides 
a useful background in which to generate mutations in genes involved in 
sporulation, therefore providing an exciting new tool to unravel key aspects of 
sporulation in C. difficile.

One hypothesis for the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is that an altered 
or pathogenic microbiota causes inflammation in a genetically susceptible 
individual. Understanding the microbiota's role in the pathogenesis of the 
disease could lead to new IBD treatments aimed at shifting the bacteria in the 
gut back to eubiosis. Probiotics have some efficacy in the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis (UC), but our current repertoire is limited in potency. Fecal 
microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal 
and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory 
Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully 
treating UC. Further clinical studies are justified, and could be complemented 
by mouse models of fecal transplantation, in which variables can be controlled 
and manipulated.

The current study sought to delineate the gene expression profile of the host 
response in the caecum and colon during acute infection with Clostridium 
difficile in a mouse model of infection, and to investigate the nature of the 
unfolded protein response in this process. The infected mice displayed a 
significant up-regulation in the expression of chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2 and 
Ccl2), numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ifng, Il1b, Il6, and Il17f), as well 
as Il22 and a number of anti-microbial peptides (Defa1, Defa28, Defb1, Slpi and 
Reg3g) at the site(s) of infection. This was accompanied by a significant influx 
of neutrophils, dendritic cells, cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and 
all major subsets of lymphocytes to these site(s). However, CD4 T cells of the 
untreated and C. difficile-infected mice expressed similar levels of CD69 and 
CD25. Neither tissue had up-regulated levels of Tbx21, Gata3 or Rorc. The caeca 
and colons of the infected mice showed a significant increase in eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation, but neither the splicing of Xbp1 
nor the up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, casting doubt on the 
full-fledged induction of the unfolded protein response by C. difficile. They 
also displayed significantly higher phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), an indication of pro-survival 
signalling. These data underscore the local, innate, pro-inflammatory nature of 
the response to C. difficile and highlight eIF2α phosphorylation and the 
interleukin-22-pSTAT3-RegIIIγ axis as two of the pathways that could be used to 
contain and counteract the damage inflicted on the intestinal epithelium.

Clostridium difficile is mainly considered a nosocomial pathogen associated with 
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients. Austrian 
hospitals reported 2761 cases of C. difficile infection (including 277 lethal 
outcomes) in 2007, compared with 777 cases (including 54 lethal outcomes) in 
2003. The occurrence of community-acquired C. difficile infection is also 
increasingly reported. Recent studies have shown the occurrence of C. difficile 
in food and animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the 
occurrence of C. difficile in food and animals in Austria. Between March and 
July 2008, gut or fecal samples from 67 cows, 61 pigs and 59 broiler chickens 
were collected at Austrian abattoirs. Between February and April 2008 meat 
samples (51 beef [25 ground], 27 pork [17 ground] and 6 samples of chicken meat) 
were purchased at retail outlets. Of the 187 samples tested, eight yielded C. 
difficile: in cows 3/67 samples (4.5%) were positive, in pigs 2/61 (3.3%), in 
broiler chickens 3/59 (5%). Six of the eight isolates yielded toxigenic C. 
difficile (toxins A and B): 2/67 (3%) cow samples, 2/61 (3.3%) pig samples, 2/59 
(3.4%) chicken samples. Genes for the binary toxin were detected in one of the 
two pig isolates, a PCR ribotype 126 strain. None of the 84 meat samples yielded 
C. difficile. The results of this Austrian study suggest that animal reservoirs 
are possible sources, via food, of human C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis are 
typically treated with vancomycin or metronidazole, but recent increases in 
relapse incidence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of C. difficile 
indicate the need for new antibiotics. We previously isolated coprisin, an 
antibacterial peptide from Copris tripartitus, a Korean dung beetle, and 
identified a nine-amino-acid peptide in the α-helical region of it (LLCIALRKK) 
that had antimicrobial activity (J.-S. Hwang et al., Int. J. Pept., 2009, 
doi:10.1155/2009/136284). Here, we examined whether treatment with a coprisin 
analogue (a disulfide dimer of the nine peptides) prevented inflammation and 
mucosal damage in a mouse model of acute gut inflammation established by 
administration of antibiotics followed by C. difficile infection. In this model, 
coprisin treatment significantly ameliorated body weight decreases, improved the 
survival rate, and decreased mucosal damage and proinflammatory cytokine 
production. In contrast, the coprisin analogue had no apparent antibiotic 
activity against commensal bacteria, including Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium, which are known to inhibit the colonization of C. difficile. 
The exposure of C. difficile to the coprisin analogue caused a marked increase 
in nuclear propidium iodide (PI) staining, indicating membrane damage; the 
staining levels were similar to those seen with bacteria treated with a positive 
control for membrane disruption (EDTA). In contrast, coprisin analogue treatment 
did not trigger increases in the nuclear PI staining of Bifidobacterium 
thermophilum. This observation suggests that the antibiotic activity of the 
coprisin analogue may occur through specific membrane disruption of C. 
difficile. Thus, these results indicate that the coprisin analogue may prove 
useful as a therapeutic agent for C. difficile infection-associated inflammatory 
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis.

Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis result from the actions of bacterial 
exotoxins on the colonic mucosa. This study examined the ability of hyperimmune 
bovine colostral antibodies to neutralize the biological effects of these 
toxins. Anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate was prepared from 
the colostral milk of Holstein cows previously immunized with C. difficile 
toxoids. The anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate contained high 
levels of bovine immunoglobulin G specific for C. difficile toxins A and B, as 
evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-C. difficile bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate neutralized the cytotoxic effects of purified toxin A 
and toxin B on cultured human fibroblasts, whereas control bovine immunoglobulin 
concentrate had little toxin-neutralizing activity. Anti-C. difficile bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate also blocked the binding of toxin A to its enterocyte 
receptor and inhibited the enterotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins on the rat 
ileum, as measured by an increased rat ileal loop weight/length ratio (63% 
inhibition; P < 0.01), increased mannitol permeability (92% inhibition; P < 
0.01), and histologic grading of enteritis (P < 0.01 versus nonimmune bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate). Thus, anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin 
concentrate neutralizes the cytotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins in vitro 
and inhibits their enterotoxic effects in vivo. This agent may be clinically 
useful in the prevention and treatment of C. difficile diarrhea and colitis.

Intestinal epithelial cell culture is important for biological, functional, and 
immunological studies. Since enterocytes have a short in vivo life span due to 
anoikis, we aimed to establish a novel and reproducible method to prolong the 
survival of mouse and human cells. Cells were isolated following a standard 
procedure, and cultured on ordered-cow's collagen membranes. A prolonged cell 
life span was achieved; cells covered the complete surface of bio-membranes and 
showed a classical enterocyte morphology with high expression of enzymes 
supporting the possibility of cryopreservation. Apoptosis was dramatically 
reduced and cultured enterocytes expressed cytokeratin and LGR5 (low frequency). 
Cells exposed to LPS or flagellin showed the induction of TLR4 and TLR5 
expression and a functional phenotype upon exposure to the probiotic 
Bifidobacterium bifidum or the pathogenic Clostridium difficile. The secretion 
of the homeostatic (IL-25 and TSLP), inhibitory (IL-10 and TGF-β), or 
pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNF) were induced. In conclusion, this 
novel protocol using cow's collagen-ordered membrane provides a simple and 
reproducible method to maintain intestinal epithelial cells functional for 
cell-microorganism interaction studies and stem cell expansion. J. Cell.

Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat 
analysis (MLVA) and antimicrobial susceptibility were performed on 37 animal and 
human C. difficile isolates belonging to 15 different PCR-ribotypes in order to 
investigate the relatedness of human and animal isolates and to identify 
possible transmission routes. MLVA identified a total of 21 different types 
while MLST only distinguished 12 types. Identical C. difficile strains were 
detected in the same animal species for PCR-ribotypes 014, 078, UCL 16U and UCL 
36, irrespective of their origin or the isolation date. Non clonal strains were 
found among different hosts; however, a high genetic association between pig and 
cattle isolates belonging to PCR-ribotype 078 was revealed. MLVA also showed 
genetic differences that clearly distinguished human from animal strains. For a 
given PCR-ribotype, human and animal strains presented a similar susceptibility 
to the antimicrobials tested. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin, 
metronidazole, chloramphenicol and rifampicin, while PCR-ribotypes 078, UCL 5a, 
UCL 36 and UCL 103 were associated with erythromycin resistance. The data 
suggest a wide dissemination of clones at hospitals and breeding-farms or a 
contamination at the slaughterhouse, but less probability of interspecies 
transmission. However, further highly discriminatory genotyping methods are 
necessary to elucidate interspecies and zoonotic transmission of C. difficile.

Clostridium difficile is considered to be one of the major cause of infectious 
diarrhea in healthcare systems worldwide. Symptoms of C. difficile infection are 
caused largely by the production of two cytotoxins: toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B 
(TcdB). Vaccine development is considered desirable as it would decrease the 
mounting medical costs and mortality associated with C. difficile infections. 
Biodegradable nanoparticles composed of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and 
chitosan have proven to be a safe and effective antigen delivery system for many 
viral vaccines. However, few studies have used this efficient antigen carrier 
for bacterial vaccine development. In this study, we eliminated the toxin 
activity domain of toxin B by constructing a recombinant protein rTcdB consists 
of residues 1852-2363 of TcdB receptor binding domain. The rTcdB was 
encapsulated in nanoparticles composed of γ-PGA and chitosan. Three rounds of 
intraperitoneal vaccination led to high anti-TcdB antibody responses and 
afforded mice full protection mice from lethal dose of C. difficile spore 
challenge. Protection was associated with high levels of toxin-neutralizing 
antibodies, and the rTcdB-encapsulated NPs elicited a longer-lasting antibody 
titers than antigen with the conventional adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide. 
Significant reductions in the level of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
were observed in vaccinated mouse. These results suggested that polymeric 
nanocomplex-based vaccine design can be useful in developing vaccine against C. 
difficile infections.

Vancomycin is a preferred antibiotic for treating Clostridium difficile 
infection (CDI) and has been associated with a rate of recurrence of CDI of as 
high as 20% in treated patients. Recent studies have suggested that berberine, 
an alternative medical therapy for gastroenteritis and diarrhea, exhibits 
several beneficial effects, including induction of anti-inflammatory responses 
and restoration of the intestinal barrier function. This study investigated the 
therapeutic effects of berberine on preventing CDI relapse and restoring the gut 
microbiota in a mouse model. Berberine was administered through gavage to 
C57BL/6 mice with established CDI-induced intestinal injury and colitis. The 
disease activity index (DAI), mean relative weight, histopathology scores, and 
levels of toxins A and B in fecal samples were measured. An Illumina 
sequencing-based analysis of 16S rRNA genes was used to determine the overall 
structural change in the microbiota in the mouse ileocecum. Berberine 
administration significantly promoted the restoration of the intestinal 
microbiota by inhibiting the expansion of members of the family 
Enterobacteriaceae and counteracting the side effects of vancomycin treatment. 
Therapy consisting of vancomycin and berberine combined prevented weight loss, 
improved the DAI and the histopathology scores, and effectively decreased the 
mortality rate. Berberine prevented CDIs from relapsing and significantly 
improved survival in the mouse model of CDI. Our data indicate that a 
combination of berberine and vancomycin is more effective than vancomycin alone 
for treating CDI. One of the possible mechanisms by which berberine prevents a 
CDI relapse is through modulation of the gut microbiota. Although this 
conclusion was generated in the case of the mouse model, use of the combination 
of vancomycin and berberine and represent a novel therapeutic approach targeting 
CDI.

Clostridium difficile is responsible for a wide spectrum of infection from 
asymptomatic carriage to severe, relapsing colitis. Since 2003, C. difficile 
infections have increased with a higher morbidity and mortality due to the 
emergence of epidemic and hypervirulent C. difficile strains such as those of 
the epidemic lineage 027/BI/NAP1. To decipher the hypervirulence and epidemicity 
of 027 strains, we analyzed gene expression profiles of the R20291 027 strain 
using a monoxenic mouse model during the first 38h of infection. A total of 741 
genes were differentially expressed during the course of infection. They are 
mainly distributed in functional categories involved in host adaptation. Several 
genes of PTS and ABC transporters were significantly regulated during the 
infection, underlying the ability of strain R20291 to adapt its metabolism 
according to nutrient availability in the digestive tract. In this animal model, 
despite the early sporulation process, sporulation efficiency seems to indicate 
that growth of R20291 vegetative cells versus spores were favored during 
infection. The bacterial mechanisms associated to adaptability and flexibility 
within the gut environment, in addition to the virulence factor expression and 
antibiotic resistance, should contribute to the epidemicity and hypervirulence 
of the C. difficile 027 strains.

Interaction of Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli with microfloras in 
continuous-flow cultures and gnotobiotic mice.

Wilson KH, Freter R.

We studied the interactions between the entire cecal flora of hamsters and the 
pathogens Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli in gnotobiotic mice and in 
a continuous-flow (CF) culture system in which the growth medium consisted of an 
extract of fecal pellets from germfree mice. CF cultures and germfree mice were 
colonized first with C. difficile and E. coli and then with the cecal flora of 
hamsters. Both in vivo and in vitro hamster flora markedly suppressed the 
potential pathogens. Contents of CF cultures inoculated with hamster flora were 
introduced into gnotobiotic mice previously colonized with C. difficile and E. 
coli. These mice were compared with mice given homogenates of hamster ceca. In 
both groups, the C. difficile population decreased by a factor of more than 
10(6) and the E. coli population decreased by a factor of 10(4) to 10(5). CF 
culture contents also reduced the size of the dilated germfree mouse cecum to 
normal. When veal infusion broth was used as a medium, contents of CF cultures 
colonized with hamster flora failed to eliminate C. difficile from mice. Thus, 
the extract of fecal pellets appeared to contain a substance important for 
sustained colonization by important components of the cecal flora. We also 
studied the ability of collections of isolates to suppress the potential 
pathogens in both gnotobiotic mice and CF cultures. A total of 150 isolates 
obtained from predominant hamster flora at the ecologic climax stage (C flora) 
suppressed C. difficile and E. coli to 10 and 1 to 3%, respectively, of the 
population sizes attained in monoassociated mice. A total of 67 isolates 
obtained during ecologic succession combined with a C flora consisting of 100 
isolates suppressed the potential pathogens to 0.3 and 0.03% of their original 
levels, respectively. Similar degrees of suppression occurred in CF cultures, 
further indicating that anaerobic CF cultures are promising models for 
investigation of the microbial ecology of C. difficile.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major healthcare-associated disease 
with high recurrence rates. Host colonization is critical for the infectious 
process, both in first episodes and in recurrent disease, with biofilm formation 
playing a key role. The ability of C. difficile to form a biofilm on abiotic 
surfaces is established, but has not yet been confirmed in the intestinal tract. 
Here, four different isolates of C. difficile, which are in vitro biofilm 
producers, were studied for their ability to colonize germ-free mice. The level 
of colonization achieved was similar for all isolates in the different parts of 
the murine gastrointestinal tract, but pathogen burden was higher in the cecum 
and colon. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that C. difficile 
bacteria were distributed heterogeneously over the intestinal tissue, without 
contact with epithelial cells. The R20291 strain, which belongs to the Ribotype 
027 lineage, displayed a unique behavior compared to the other strains by 
forming numerous aggregates. By immunochemistry analyses, we showed that 
bacteria were localized inside and outside the mucus layer, irrespective of the 
strains tested. Most bacteria were entrapped in 3-D structures overlaying the 
mucus layer. For the R20291 strain, the cell-wall associated polysaccharide 
PS-II was detected in large amounts in the 3-D structure. As this component has 
been detected in the extrapolymeric matrix of in vitro C. difficile biofilms, 
our data suggest strongly that at least the R20291 strain is organized in the 
mono-associated mouse model in glycan-rich biofilm architecture, which 
sustainably maintains bacteria outside the mucus layer.

Kick the Bucket: One Hospital System's Journey to Reduce Clostridium Difficile.

PROBLEM: Albert Einstein defines insanity as doing the same thing over again but 
expecting different results. Although the United States claims to reduce 
antibiotic abuse, practice strict isolation, and clean meticulously, the burden 
of Clostridium difficile outpaces goals. Unless innovative approaches are tried, 
we risk culling elderly, immunosuppressed, and otherwise debilitated 
populations. Emergency departments are a primary access point for patients who 
are unable to wait for primary care. As a result, many patients with diarrhea 
are seen in emergency departments.
METHODS: This article describes one hospital system's quality improvement trial 
of disposable commode pails (DCPs) for high-acuity patients in 3 of 5 
institutions. The rationale was to prevent staff from touching surfaces heavily 
contaminated with C difficile. Staff members were not to wash or reuse commode 
buckets between patients. Instead, DCPs were substituted, and only the commode 
chairs were wiped. For quantitative date, C difficile infections (CDIs) were 
compared across hospitals. Staff members were surveyed for qualitative data.
RESULTS: According to Survey Monkey, the rate of employee satisfaction with the 
new process was 95%. Fewer sewage backups resulted because nonbiodegradable 
wipes were disposed inside DCPs rather than in toilets or hoppers. 
Implementation and product costs were justified through labor savings and a 
reduced incidence of CDIs. CDI improvements were noted in system hospital 
emergency departments that used DCPs. Moreover, in one hospital that used DCPs 
in all nursing units for 1 year, CDI rates were reduced by 32%.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Third-party hospital laboratories generated all CDI 
data, which reduced bias. However, laboratories were unable to stratify CDIs as 
inpatient and outpatient in origin. More research is recommended with larger ED 
patient sample sizes.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium that has re-emerged as a 
facultative pathogen and can cause nosocomial diarrhea, colitis or even death. 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ has been implicated in the 
prevention of inflammation in autoimmune and infectious diseases; however, its 
role in the immunoregulatory mechanisms modulating host responses to C. 
difficile and its toxins remains largely unknown. To characterize the role of 
PPARγ in C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD), immunity and gut pathology, we 
used a mouse model of C. difficile infection in wild-type and T cell-specific 
PPARγ null mice. The loss of PPARγ in T cells increased disease activity and 
colonic inflammatory lesions following C. difficile infection. Colonic 
expression of IL-17 was upregulated and IL-10 downregulated in colons of T 
cell-specific PPARγ null mice. Also, both the loss of PPARγ in T cells and C. 
difficile infection favored Th17 responses in spleen and colonic lamina propria 
of mice with CDAD. MicroRNA (miRNA)-sequencing analysis and RT-PCR validation 
indicated that miR-146b was significantly overexpressed and nuclear receptor 
co-activator 4 (NCOA4) suppressed in colons of C. difficile-infected mice. We 
next developed a computational model that predicts the upregulation of miR-146b, 
downregulation of the PPARγ co-activator NCOA4, and PPARγ, leading to 
upregulation of IL-17. Oral treatment of C. difficile-infected mice with the 
PPARγ agonist pioglitazone ameliorated colitis and suppressed pro-inflammatory 
gene expression. In conclusion, our data indicates that miRNA-146b and PPARγ 
activation may be implicated in the regulation of Th17 responses and colitis in 
C. difficile-infected mice.

Clostridium difficile colonization in pig intestine has been a public health 
concern. We analyzed C. difficile prevalence among piglets in Japan to clarify 
their origin and extent of the associated risk by using molecular and 
microbiological methods for both swine and human clinical isolates and foreign 
isolates. C. difficile was isolated from 120 neonatal piglet fecal samples. 
Toxin gene profile, antimicrobial susceptibilities, PCR ribotype, and 
multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) type of swine 
isolates were determined and compared with those of human clinical and foreign 
isolates. One-hundred C. difficile strains were isolated from 69 (57.5%) 
samples, and 61 isolates (61%) were toxin gene-positive. Some isolates were 
resistant to antimicrobials, contributing to antibiotic-associated diarrhea by 
C. difficile. These results suggest that C. difficile, prevalent among Japanese 
pigs, is a potential risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Furthermore, PCR 
ribotype 078 (12 isolates), which has been linked to multiple outbreaks 
worldwide, was the third-most frequently isolated of the 14 PCR ribotypes 
identified. Moreover, MLVA revealed that all 12 PCR ribotype 078 isolates were 
genetically related to European PCR ribotype 078 strains found in both humans 
and pigs. To date, in Japan, many breeding pigs have been imported from European 
countries. The genetic relatedness of C. difficile isolates of Japanese swine 
origin to those of European origin suggests that they were introduced into Japan 
via imported pigs.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a worldwide health threat that is 
typically triggered by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the 
natural gut microbiota and allow this Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen to 
thrive. The increased incidence and severity of disease coupled with decreased 
response, high recurrence rates, and emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant 
strains have created an urgent need for new therapies. We describe 
pharmacological targeting of the cysteine protease domain (CPD) within the C. 
difficile major virulence factor toxin B (TcdB). Through a targeted screen with 
an activity-based probe for this protease domain, we identified a number of 
potent CPD inhibitors, including one bioactive compound, ebselen, which is 
currently in human clinical trials for a clinically unrelated indication. This 
drug showed activity against both major virulence factors, TcdA and TcdB, in 
biochemical and cell-based studies. Treatment in a mouse model of CDI that 
closely resembles the human infection confirmed a therapeutic benefit in the 
form of reduced disease pathology in host tissues that correlated with 
inhibition of the release of the toxic glucosyltransferase domain (GTD). Our 
results show that this non-antibiotic drug can modulate the pathology of disease 
and therefore could potentially be developed as a therapeutic for the treatment 
of CDI.

Traditional Chinese medicine QPYF has a good effect for treating 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to 
test its efficacy to prevent Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) in 
a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with Clostridium difficile VPI 10463 
after exposure to antimicrobial mixture. QPYF was administered from 7 days prior 
to Clostridium difficile infection to 20 days after infection, and its effect 
was compared with no treatment and receiving placebo. The mice were monitored 
for 20 days and the percent survival, disease activity index, weight loss, colon 
histopathology, and the levels of toxins in the feces were measured. The 
expressions of TNF α, MCP-1, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in the colon were 
presented by immunohistochemistry. The survival rate of QPYF group (93.75%) was 
higher than that of model control group (65%). The mice treated with QPYF had a 
lower weight loss and disease activity index, compared to the mice with placebo. 
A significantly lower level of histopathology scores, toxins in the feces, and 
TNF α, MCP-1, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 were detected for QPYF-treated 
mice. Traditional Chinese medicine QPYF showed a good preventive effect for CDAD 
in a mouse model.

Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous 
colitis mainly through two exotoxins TcdA and TcdB that target intestinal 
epithelial cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in regulating 
intestinal inflammatory responses. In the current study, we explored the 
interaction of TcdB-intoxicated epithelial cells with mouse bone marrow-derived 
DCs. TcdB induced cell death and heat shock protein translocation in mouse 
intestinal epithelial CT26 cells. The intoxicated epithelial cells promoted the 
phagocytosis and the TNF-α secretion by DCs. Incubation with TcdB-intoxicated 
CT26 cells stimulated DC maturation. Moreover, TcdB-treated CT26 cells induced 
DC immigration when they were injected into mice subcutaneously. Taken together, 
these data demonstrate that TcdB-intoxicated intestinal epithelial cells are 
able to stimulate DC activation in vitro and attract DCs in vivo, indicating 
that epithelial cells may be able to regulate DC activation under the exposure 
of TcdB during C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile, which causes pseudomembranous colitis, releases toxin A 
and toxin B. These toxins are considered to be the main causative agents for the 
disease pathogenesis, and their expression is associated with a marked increase 
of apoptosis in mucosal epithelial cells. Colonic epithelial cells are believed 
to form a physical barrier between the lumen and the submucosa, and abnormally 
increased mucosal epithelial cell apoptosis is considered to be an initial step 
in gut inflammation responses. Therefore, one approach to treating 
pseudomembranous colitis would be to develop agents that block the mucosal 
epithelial cell apoptosis caused by toxin A, thus restoring barrier function and 
curing inflammatory responses in the gut. We recently isolated an antimicrobial 
peptide, Periplanetasin-2 (Peri-2, YPCKLNLKLGKVPFH) from the American cockroach, 
whose extracts have shown great potential for clinical use. Here, we assessed 
whether Peri-2 could inhibit the cell toxicity and inflammation caused by C. 
difficile toxin A. Indeed, in human colonocyte HT29 cells, Peri-2 inhibited the 
toxin A-induced decrease in cell proliferation and ameliorated the cell 
apoptosis induced by this toxin. Moreover, in the toxin A-induced mouse 
enteritis model, Peri-2 blocked the mucosal disruption and inflammatory response 
caused by toxin A. These results suggest that the American cockroach peptide 
Peri-2 could be a possible drug candidate for addressing the pseudomembranous 
colitis caused by C. difficile toxin A.

Clostridium difficile is an opportunistic pathogen causing gut inflammation 
generally associated with an intestinal dysbiosis due to antibiotics. Several 
virulence factors have been identified as playing a key role in gut 
colonization. The surface-layer proteins, comprised of two proteins, the high 
molecular weight SlpA (HMW-SLP) and the low molecular weight SlpA (LMW-SLP), are 
the most abundant proteins on the C. difficile surface. These two proteins are 
derived from the Cwp84-mediated cleavage of a single precursor protein SlpA. In 
this study, we assessed the immunogenic properties of a recombinant SlpA 
precursor derived from a toxigenic C. difficile strain (630) and its protective 
effect as a vaccine antigen co-administered with the cholera toxin as an 
adjuvant in both hamster and mouse models. First, we confirmed the 
immunogenicity of SlpA in humans. Sera from patients with C. difficile infection 
were analyzed by ELISA. Patients with CDI have a greater number of SlpA 
antibodies than healthy patients, confirming the immunogenicity of this protein 
during the pathogenic process. Then, rectal vaccination assays were performed in 
both conventional hamsters and mice. The animals' sera were sampled before and 
after vaccination, and were analyzed by ELISA. In addition, in the mouse model, 
feces were sampled after vaccination and IgA directed against SlpA were detected 
by ELISA. In both models, the intestinal colonization was evaluated by fecal 
bacterial count after challenge. Intra-rectal vaccination with SlpA and cholera 
toxin as an adjuvant induced a local and systemic humoral immune response in 
mice and hamsters potentially responsible for the weak decrease of C. difficile 
colonization in mice and the partial protection observed in a lethal-hamster 
model.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB), considered to 
be essential for C. difficile infection, affect the morphology of several cell 
types with different potencies and timing. However, morphological changes over 
various time scales are poorly characterized. The toxins' glucosyltransferase 
domains are critical to their deleterious effects, and cell responses to 
glucosyltransferase-independent activities are incompletely understood. By 
tracking morphological changes of multiple cell types to C. difficile toxins 
with high temporal resolution, cellular responses to TcdA, TcdB, and a 
glucosyltransferase-deficient TcdB (gdTcdB) are elucidated.
RESULTS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, J774 macrophage-like cells, and 
four epithelial cell lines (HCT8, T84, CHO, and immortalized mouse cecal 
epithelial cells) were treated with TcdA, TcdB, gdTcdB. Impedance across cell 
cultures was measured to track changes in cell morphology. Metrics from 
impedance data, developed to quantify rapid and long-lasting responses, produced 
standard curves with wide dynamic ranges that defined cell line sensitivities. 
Except for T84 cells, all cell lines were most sensitive to TcdB. J774 
macrophages stretched and increased in size in response to TcdA and TcdB but not 
gdTcdB. High concentrations of TcdB and gdTcdB (>10 ng/ml) greatly reduced 
macrophage viability. In HCT8 cells, gdTcdB did not induce a rapid cytopathic 
effect, yet it delayed TcdA and TcdB's rapid effects. gdTcdB did not clearly 
delay TcdA or TcdB's toxin-induced effects on macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial and endothelial cells have similar responses to toxins 
yet differ in timing and degree. Relative potencies of TcdA and TcdB in mouse 
epithelial cells in vitro do not correlate with potencies in vivo. TcdB requires 
glucosyltransferase activity to cause macrophages to spread, but cell death from 
high TcdB concentrations is glucosyltransferase-independent. Competition 
experiments with gdTcdB in epithelial cells confirm common TcdA and TcdB 
mechanisms, yet different responses of macrophages to TcdA and TcdB suggest 
different, additional mechanisms or targets in these cells. This first-time, 
precise quantification of the response of multiple cell lines to TcdA and TcdB 
provides a comparative framework for delineating the roles of different cell 
types and toxin-host interactions.

Recent reports suggest increased incidence and severity of Clostridium 
difficile-associated diseases. These facts have raised the need for additional 
clarification of pathogenesis and for a search for new therapeutic strategies. 
This study evaluated the effects of the polysaccharide fucoidin, an L-selectin 
blocker, on toxin-A-induced mouse enteritis. Fucoidin (25 mg/kg) or saline (0.1 
ml) were injected systemically (ocular plexus) 5 min prior to local challenge 
with toxin A (5 microg/ileal loop) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 
Intestinal fluid volume/length and ileal loop weight/length ratios were 
calculated 3 h later. Ileal tissues were collected for histopathology and 
measurement of myeloperoxidase and adenosine deaminase activity. Fucoidin 
significantly (P < 0.05) prevented the toxin-A-induced increase in weight/length 
and volume/length ratios and reduced mucosal disruption, as shown in 
histopathology. Fucoidin also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced toxin-A-induced 
myeloperoxidase and adenosine deaminase activities. In conclusion, fucoidin 
reduces tissue injury and inflammation in toxin-A-induced mouse enteritis.

Fidaxomicin is a novel macrocyclic antibiotic recently approved by the US Food 
and Drug Administration for the treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated 
diarrhea in adults. We reviewed safety data from nonclinical studies and 
clinical trials (phases 1, 2A, and 3) with fidaxomicin. In nonclinical studies, 
fidaxomicin was administered orally at approximately 1 g/kg/d to dogs for up to 
3 months with no significant target-organ toxicities observed. A total of 728 
adults have received oral fidaxomicin in clinical trials to date: 116 healthy 
volunteers and 612 patients with C. difficile infection. In phase 3 clinical 
trials, fidaxomicin was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with 
oral vancomycin. There were no differences in the incidence of death or serious 
adverse events between the 2 drugs. Fidaxomicin appears to be well tolerated. 
Continued monitoring of adverse events in the postmarketing setting will provide 
additional information about the full safety profile of fidaxomicin.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence and determine association between antimicrobia 
resistance and toxin gene profile of Clostridium difficile in commercial pigs at 
the preharvest food-safety level.
ANIMALS: 68 sows and 251 young pigs from 5 farms in North Carolina and 3 in 
Ohio.
PROCEDURES: Fecal samples were collected from sows (8/farm) and matched young 
pigs (32/farm) at farrowing and again at the nursery and finishing stages. 
Clostridium difficile isolates were tested for susceptibility to 6 
antimicrobials. A PCR assay was used to detect genes coding for enterotoxin A 
(tcdA), cytotoxin B (tcdB), and binary toxin (cdtB).
RESULTS: C difficile prevalence in young pigs at farrowing was 73% (n=183) with 
significantly higher prevalence in Ohio (875%) than in North Carolina (64%). 
Clostridium difficile was isolated from 32 (47%) sows with no significant 
difference between the 2 regions. A single pig had a positive test result at the 
nursery, and no isolate was recovered at the finishing farms. Resistance to 
ciprofloxacin was predominant in young pigs (91.3% of isolates) and sows (94%). 
The antimicrobial resistance profile ciprofloxacin-erythromycin-tetracycline was 
detected in 21.4% and 11.7% of isolates from young pigs and sows, respectively. 
Most isolates had positive results for tcdA (65%), tcdB (84%), and the binary 
toxin cdtB (77%) genes. Erythromycin resistance and tetracycline resistance were 
significantly associated with toxin gene profiles.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The common occurrence of 
antimicrobial-resistant C difficile and the significant association of toxigenic 
strains with antimicrobial resistance could contribute to high morbidity in 
farms with farrowing pigs.

TNP-2092 is a unique multitargeting drug conjugate with extremely low propensity 
for development of resistance. The in vitro activity of TNP-2092 against a panel 
of urease-producing bacteria was similar to that of rifaximin, a locally acting 
antibiotic approved for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, irritable bowel 
syndrome with diarrhea, and traveler's diarrhea. When given orally, TNP-2092 
exhibited low absorption and the majority of compound was recovered in feces as 
parent. The impact of oral TNP-2092 on gut microbiota was investigated in rats. 
TNP-2092 was administered to rats by oral gavage for 7 days. Feces samples were 
collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Although the total amount of 
bacterial load appeared relatively unchanged before, during, and after 
treatment, significant changes in the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria 
at family and genus levels were observed. Some of the changes are known to be 
associated with improvement of symptoms associated with liver cirrhosis and 
hepatic encephalopathy. The observed effects of TNP-2092 on gut microbiota in 
rats were similar to those of rifaximin. In vivo, TNP-2092 demonstrated potent 
efficacy in a mouse Clostridium difficile infection model, superior to 
metronidazole and vancomycin, with no relapse observed after treatment. TNP-2092 
is currently in clinical development for the treatment of symptoms associated 
with gastrointestinal and liver disorders.

The goal of this study was to determine the fecal prevalence of Clostridium 
difficile in dogs who were patients at a veterinary medical teaching hospital. 
Stool specimens collected from 152 dogs (in- and outpatients) were analyzed for 
the presence of C. difficile. An additional 42 stool specimens were collected 
and examined from dogs recently housed at local animal shelters. Following 
culture on selective medium, C. difficile was identified by a latex 
agglutination test, and the presence of the toxin A and B genes was determined 
individually by polymerase chain reaction. Clostridium difficile was isolated 
from the feces of 28 of the veterinary hospital patients (18.4%); isolates from 
14 of these patients (50.0%) were toxigenic. Diarrhea was a clinical finding in 
5 (35.7%) of the dogs carrying toxigenic isolates of C. difficile, whereas 
diarrhea was noted in only 2 of 14 dogs (14.3%) shedding nontoxigenic isolates. 
Three of 14 dogs (21.4%) shedding toxigenic isolates of C. difficile were 
receiving antibiotics at the time of stool collection, whereas 5 of 14 dogs 
(37.5%) shedding nontoxigenic strains of C. difficile were receiving 
antibiotics. The carriage rate of C. difficile was significantly higher for 
animals categorized as inpatients of the veterinary hospital. The carriage rate 
also provided evidence for an increased risk for fecal shedding with increasing 
age. Clostridium difficile was not isolated from any of the 42 dogs recently 
housed at local animal shelters. This study confirms the presence of toxigenic 
C. difficile in dogs at a veterinary teaching hospital.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic condition and the most common 
form of inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of standard treatment is mainly to 
induce and maintain remission with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive agents, 
and/or colectomy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used 
successfully to treat relapsing or refractory Clostridium difficile infection. 
The alteration of microbiota in mouse models of UC as well as in patients 
suggested the possibility of treating UC with FMT.
AIMS: To study the effects of FMT on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC 
model in mice.
METHODS: Littermates of BALB/c and C57BL/6J were randomized into four groups: 
normal control , treatment with DSS for 7 days (DSS - FMT), treatment with DSS 
followed by FMT for another 8 days (DSS + FMT), and treatment with DSS and FMT 
followed by another 5 days for recovery (remission). Body weight, survival rate, 
and DAI scores of mice in each group were recorded. Changes in distal colon were 
studied by histopathology. Alterations of spleen and lamina propria regulatory 
lymphocytes, major bacterial species in feces and inflammatory cytokines in 
colon were also studied.
RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice experienced more significant weight loss than BALB/c mice 
after DSS treatment, regardless of whether the two strains of mice were 
co-housed or not. FMT caused reversal of DAI scores in BALB/c but not in 
C57BL/6J mice. In BALB/c mice, FMT also reduced colon inflammation that was 
paralleled by decreased inflammatory cytokine levels, altered bacterial 
microbiota, and regulatory lymphocyte proportions.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT is effective in a mouse model of UC through its modulation on 
gut microbiota and the host immune system.

Clostridium difficile causes increasing numbers of life-threatening intestinal 
infections. Symptoms associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) are mediated 
by secreted protein toxins, whose virulence is modulated by intracellular 
auto-proteolysis following allosteric activation of their protease domains by 
inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Here, we explore the possibility of 
inactivating the C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) by triggering its auto-proteolysis 
in the gut lumen prior to cell uptake using gain-of-function small molecules. We 
anticipated that high calcium concentrations typically found in the gut would 
strongly chelate IP6, precluding it from pre-emptively inducing toxin 
auto-proteolysis if administered exogenously. We therefore designed IP6 analogs 
with reduced susceptibility to complexation by calcium, which maintained 
allosteric activity at physiological calcium concentrations. We found that oral 
administration of IP6 analogs attenuated inflammation and promoted survival in 
mouse models of CDI. Our data provide impetus to further develop small-molecule 
allosteric triggers of toxin auto-proteolysis as a therapeutic strategy.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Clostridium difficile infection cause 
gastrointestinal (GI) distension and, in severe cases, toxic megacolon with risk 
of perforation and death. Herpesviruses have been linked to severe GI 
dilatation. MHV-68 is a model for human gamma herpesvirus infection inducing GI 
dilatation in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice but is benign in wildtype 
mice. MHV-68 also causes lethal vasculitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in 
interferon gamma receptor-deficient (IFNγR-/-) mice, but GI dilatation has not 
been reported. In prior work the Myxomavirus-derived anti-inflammatory serpin, 
Serp-1, improved survival, reducing vasculitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in 
MHV-68-infected IFNγR-/- mice with significantly increased IL-10. IL-10 has been 
investigated as treatment for GI dilatation with variable efficacy. We report 
here that MHV-68 infection produces severe GI dilatation with inflammation and 
gut wall degradation in 28% of INFγR-/- mice. Macrophage invasion and smooth 
muscle degradation were accompanied by decreased concentrations of T helper 
(Th2), B, monocyte, and dendritic cells. Plasma and spleen IL-10 were 
significantly reduced in mice with GI dilatation, while interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and INFγ increased. Treatment 
of gamma herpesvirus-infected mice with exogenous IL-10 prevents severe GI 
inflammation and dilatation, suggesting benefit for herpesvirus-induced 
dilatation.

The changing epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection over the past 
decades presents a significant challenge in the management of C. difficile 
associated diseases. The gastrointestinal tract microbiota provides colonization 
resistance against C. difficile, and growing evidence suggests that gut 
microbial derived secondary bile acids (SBAs) play a role. We hypothesized that 
the C. difficile life cycle; spore germination and outgrowth, growth, and toxin 
production, of strains that vary by age and ribotype will differ in their 
sensitivity to SBAs. C. difficile strains R20291 and CD196 (ribotype 027), M68 
and CF5 (017), 630 (012), BI9 (001) and M120 (078) were used to define 
taurocholate (TCA) mediated spore germination and outgrowth, growth, and toxin 
activity in the absence and presence of gut microbial derived SBAs 
(deoxycholate, isodeoxycholate, lithocholate, isolithocholate, ursodeoxycholate, 
ω-muricholate, and hyodeoxycholate) found in the human and mouse large 
intestine. C. difficile strains varied in their rates of germination, growth 
kinetics, and toxin activity without the addition of SBAs. C. difficile M120, a 
highly divergent strain, had robust germination, growth, but significantly lower 
toxin activity compared to other strains. Many SBAs were able to inhibit TCA 
mediated spore germination and outgrowth, growth, and toxin activity in a dose 
dependent manner, but the level of inhibition and resistance varied across all 
strains and ribotypes. This study illustrates how clinically relevant 
C. difficile strains can have different responses when exposed to SBAs present 
in the gastrointestinal tract.

Clostridium difficile infection is the most common cause of severe cases of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and is a significant health burden. Recent 
increases in the rate of C. difficile infection have paralleled the emergence of 
a specific phylogenetic clade of C. difficile strains (ribotype 027; North 
American pulsed-field electrophoresis 1 [NAP1]; restriction endonuclease 
analysis [REA] group BI). Initial reports indicated that ribotype 027 strains 
were associated with increased morbidity and mortality and might be 
hypervirulent. Although subsequent work has raised some doubt as to whether 
ribotype 027 strains are hypervirulent, the strains are considered epidemic 
isolates that have caused severe outbreaks across the globe. We hypothesized 
that one factor that could lead to the increased prevalence of ribotype 027 
strains would be if these strains had increased competitive fitness compared to 
strains of other ribotypes. We developed a moderate-throughput in vitro model of 
C. difficile infection and used it to test competition between four ribotype 027 
clinical isolates and clinical isolates of four other ribotypes (001, 002, 014, 
and 053). We found that ribotype 027 strains outcompeted the strains of other 
ribotypes. A similar competitive advantage was observed when two ribotype pairs 
were competed in a mouse model of C. difficile infection. Based upon these 
results, we conclude that one possible mechanism through which ribotype 027 
strains have caused outbreaks worldwide is their increased ability to compete in 
the presence of a complex microbiota.

Neutralization of Clostridium difficile toxin by Clostridium sordellii 
antitoxins.

Chang TW, Gorbach SL, Bartlett JB.

Neutralization of Clostridium difficile toxin by Clostridium sordellii antitoxin 
was studied by cytotoxicity assay in tissue culture. The sources of toxin were 
stools from two patients with pseudomembranous colitis and a culture filtrate of 
C. difficile isolated from one of the patients. C. sordellii antitoxin was 
available either in monovalent form or as gas gangrene polyvalent antitoxin. The 
potency of antitoxins against C. difficile determined by cytotoxicity assay did 
not correlate with the established values reported for mouse protection tests 
against C. sordellii toxin. An equivalent zone of optimal neutralization was 
demonstrated for stool toxin, and a slightly different one for culture toxin. 
The rate of neutralization appeared to be instantaneous, either at 24 or at 37 
degrees C. The efficacy of antitoxin in preventing cytotoxicity in cultured 
cells preexposed to toxin decreased rapidly with preexposure time. The union 
between toxin and antitoxin could be readily dissociated by simple dilution or 
by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dissociated by simple dilution or 
by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dilution. Continued incubation of 
toxin-antitoxin mixture did not increase the firmness of the union; on the 
contrary, more dissociation occurred. The unusual looseness of the 
toxin-antitoxin union is probably relatd to lack of serological specificity or 
affinity. Based on these observations, a practical diagnostic method for 
antibiotic-induced colitis is outlined.

Clostridium difficile, a major cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea, triggers 
disease through the release of two toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). 
These toxins disrupt the cytoskeleton of the intestinal epithelial cell, 
increasing intestinal permeability and triggering the release of inflammatory 
mediators resulting in intestinal injury and inflammation. The most prevalent 
animal model to study TcdA/TcdB-induced intestinal injury involves injecting 
toxin into the lumen of a surgically generated "ileal loop." This model is 
time-consuming and exhibits variability depending on the expertise of the 
surgeon. Furthermore, the target organ of C. difficile infection (CDI) in humans 
is the colon, not the ileum. In the current study, we describe a new model of 
CDI that involves intrarectal instillation of TcdA/TcdB into the mouse colon. 
The administration of TcdA/TcdB triggered colonic inflammation and neutrophil 
and macrophage infiltration as well as increased epithelial barrier permeability 
and intestinal epithelial cell death. The damage and inflammation triggered by 
TcdA/TcdB isolates from the VPI and 630 strains correlated with the 
concentration of TcdA and TcdB produced. TcdA/TcdB exposure increased the 
expression of a number of inflammatory mediators associated with human CDI, 
including interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and IL-1β. Finally, we 
were able to demonstrate that TcdA was much more potent at inducing colonic 
injury than was TcdB but TcdB could act synergistically with TcdA to exacerbate 
injury. Taken together, our data indicate that the intrarectal murine model 
provides a robust and efficient system to examine the effects of TcdA/TcdB on 
the induction of inflammation and colonic tissue damage in the context of human 
CDI.

Farm animals are a potential reservoir for human Clostridium difficile infection 
(CDI), particularly PCR ribotype 078 which is frequently found in animals and 
humans. Here, whole genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was 
used to study the evolutionary relatedness of C. difficile 078 isolated from 
humans and animals on Dutch pig farms. All sequenced genomes were surveyed for 
potential antimicrobial resistance determinants and linked to an antimicrobial 
resistance phenotype. We sequenced the whole genome of 65 C. difficile 078 
isolates collected between 2002 and 2011 from pigs (n = 19), asymptomatic 
farmers (n = 15) and hospitalised patients (n = 31) in the Netherlands. The 
collection included 12 pairs of human and pig isolates from 2011 collected at 12 
different pig farms. A mutation rate of 1.1 SNPs per genome per year was 
determined for C. difficile 078. Importantly, we demonstrate that farmers and 
pigs were colonised with identical (no SNP differences) and nearly identical 
(less than two SNP differences) C. difficile clones. Identical tetracycline and 
streptomycin resistance determinants were present in human and animal C. 
difficile 078 isolates. Our observation that farmers and pigs share identical C. 
difficile strains suggests transmission between these populations, although we 
cannot exclude the possibility of transmission from a common environmental 
source.

Clostridium difficile toxin A causes acute colitis associated with intense 
infiltrating neutrophils. Although dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role 
in the regulation of inflammation, little is known about the effects of toxin A 
on the maturation and neutrophil-attracting chemokine expression in DCs. This 
study investigated whether C. difficile toxin A could influence the maturation 
of mouse bone-marrow-derived DCs and chemokine CXCL2 expression. Toxin A 
increased the DC maturation which was closely related to CXCL2 upregulation. 
Concurrently, toxin A activated the signals of p65/p50 nuclear factor kappa B 
(NF-kappaB) heterodimers and phospho-I kappa B kinase (IKK) in DCs. The 
increased DC maturation, CXCL2 expression, and neutrophil chemoattraction were 
significantly downregulated in the NF-kappaB knockout mice. In addition, toxin A 
activated the phosphorylated signals of mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(MAPKs), such as ERK, p38, and JNK. Of all three MAPK signals, p38 MAPK was 
significantly related to DC maturation. Thus, suppression of p38 activity using 
SB203580 and siRNA transfection resulted in the significant reduction of IKK 
activity, DC maturation, and CXCL2 upregulation by toxin A. These results 
suggest that p38 MAPK may lead to the activation of IKK and NF-kappaB signaling, 
resulting in enhanced DC maturation and CXCL2 expression in response to C. 
difficile toxin A stimulation.

Clostridium difficile pathogenesis is mainly due to toxins A and B. However, the 
first step of pathogenesis is the colonization process. We evaluated C. 
difficile surface proteins as vaccine antigens to diminish intestinal 
colonization in a human flora-associated mouse model. First, we used the 
flagellar cap protein FliD of C. difficile, in order to test several 
immunization routes: intranasal, rectal, and intragastric. The rectal route, 
which is the most efficient, was used to vaccine groups of mice with different 
antigen combinations. After immunizations, the mice were challenged with the 
toxigenic C. difficile and a significant statistical difference between the 
control group and the immunized groups was observed in the colonization levels 
of C. difficile.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the main cause of hospital-acquired 
diarrhea that can cause colitis or even death. The medical-treatment cost and 
deaths caused by CDI are increasing annually worldwide. New approaches for 
prevention and treatment of these infections are needed, such as the use of 
probiotics. Probiotics, including Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus, are 
microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when administered in 
adequate amounts. The effect of Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707 on infectious 
disease caused by C. difficile 027 was investigated in a mouse model. The 
survival rates for mice given the pathogen alone, and with live cells, or dead 
cells of B. longum were 40, 70, and 60%, respectively. In addition, the 
intestinal tissues of the B. longum-treated group maintained structural 
integrity with some degree of damage. These findings suggested that B. longum 
ATCC 15707 has a function in repressing the infectious disease caused by C. 
difficile 027.

Longitudinal study of Clostridium difficile and Methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus associated with pigs from weaning through to the end of 
processing.

There has been a recent increase in community-associated infections linked to 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. It 
is established that both pathogens can be recovered from retail pork, although 
it is unclear to what degree contamination is acquired at the farm in comparison 
to that acquired during processing. To address this gap, the following study 
reports on the carriage of MRSA and C. difficile on pigs from birth through to 
the end of processing. C. difficile was isolated from 28 (93%) of 30 pigs at 1 
day of age, but prevalence declined sharply to 1 of 26 by market age (188 days). 
MRSA prevalence peaked at 74 days of age, with 19 (68%) of 28 pigs testing 
positive, but declined to 3 of 26 at 150 days of age, with no pig being detected 
as positive at market age. At the processing facility, C. difficile was isolated 
from the holding area, with a single carcass testing positive for the pathogen 
at preevisceration. MRSA was primarily isolated from nasal swabs with 8 (31%) 
carcasses testing positive at postbleed, which increased to 14 (54%) positive at 
postscald tanks. Only one carcass (sampled at postbleed) tested positive for 
MRSA, with no recovery of the pathogen from environmental samples taken. C. 
difficile ribotype 078 predominated in the longitudinal portion of the study, 
accounting for all of the 68 isolates recovered from pigs. Only three C. 
difficile isolates, which were identified as ribotype 078, were recovered at the 
slaughterhouse. MRSA spa type 539 (t034) predominated in pigs on the farm and 
samples taken at the slaughterhouse, accounting for 80% of all isolates 
recovered. The study demonstrated that both C. difficile and MRSA acquired on 
the farm can be transferred through to processing, although no evidence for 
significant cross-contamination between carcasses or the slaughterhouse 
environment was evident.

A total of 70 puppies and their dams, distributed in 14 litters, were submitted 
to weekly fecal examinations for C. difficile during the first 10 weeks after 
birth. During the study, 94.3% of the puppies and 42.9% of the dams harboured C. 
difficile at least once in their feces. We calculated that 58% of the puppies 
carried toxigenic C. difficile at least once during the survey. In the puppies, 
C. difficile carriage rates ranging from 3.1% to 67.1% were observed at 
different moments of the observation period. In comparison, C. difficile 
carriage rate was 1.4% in a control group of healthy dogs more than 3 months 
old. Discrepancies in the toxigenic phenotype of the C. difficile strains 
isolated in the same litter showed that the neonate dogs were transiently 
infected with different strains, and that the dam is often not the source of 
infection with C. difficile. We could not demonstrate any pathogenicity of C. 
difficile for neonate dogs.

Earlier, we reported that three Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, 
trifluoperazine (TFP; an antipsychotic), amoxapine (AXPN; an antidepressant), 
and doxapram (DXP; a breathing stimulant), identified from an in vitro murine 
macrophage cytotoxicity screen, provided mice with 40 to 60% protection against 
pneumonic plague when administered at the time of infection for 1 to 3 days. In 
the present study, the therapeutic potential of these drugs against pneumonic 
plague in mice was further evaluated when they were administered at up to 48 h 
postinfection. While the efficacy of TFP was somewhat diminished as treatment 
was delayed to 24 h, the protection of mice with AXPN and DXP increased as 
treatment was progressively delayed to 24 h. At 48 h postinfection, these drugs 
provided the animals with significant protection (up to 100%) against challenge 
with the agent of pneumonic or bubonic plague when they were administered in 
combination with levofloxacin. Likewise, when they were used in combination with 
vancomycin, all three drugs provided mice with 80 to 100% protection from fatal 
oral Clostridium difficile infection when they were administered at 24 h 
postinfection. Furthermore, AXPN provided 40 to 60% protection against 
respiratory infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae when it was administered at the 
time of infection or at 24 h postinfection. Using the same in vitro cytotoxicity 
assay, we identified an additional 76/780 nonantibiotic drugs effective against 
K. pneumoniae For Acinetobacter baumannii, 121 nonantibiotic drugs were 
identified to inhibit bacterium-induced cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Of 
these 121 drugs, 13 inhibited the macrophage cytotoxicity induced by two 
additional multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains. Six of these drugs decreased 
the intracellular survival of all three A. baumannii strains in macrophages. 
These results provided further evidence of the broad applicability and 
utilization of drug repurposing screening to identify new therapeutics to combat 
multidrug-resistant pathogens of public health concern.

Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of health care-associated diarrhea with 
significant morbidity and mortality, and new options for the treatment of C. 
difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are needed. Cadazolid is a new 
oxazolidinone-type antibiotic that is currently in clinical development for 
treatment of CDAD. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial 
evaluation of cadazolid against C. difficile. Cadazolid showed potent in vitro 
activity against C. difficile with a MIC range of 0.125 to 0.5 μg/ml, including 
strains resistant to linezolid and fluoroquinolones. In time-kill kinetics 
experiments, cadazolid showed a bactericidal effect against C. difficile 
isolates, with >99.9% killing in 24 h, and was more bactericidal than 
vancomycin. In contrast to metronidazole and vancomycin, cadazolid strongly 
inhibited de novo toxin A and B formation in stationary-phase cultures of 
toxigenic C. difficile. Cadazolid also inhibited C. difficile spore formation 
substantially at growth-inhibitory concentrations. In the hamster and mouse 
models for CDAD, cadazolid was active, conferring full protection from diarrhea 
and death with a potency similar to that of vancomycin. These findings support 
further investigations of cadazolid for the treatment of CDAD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial 
infectious diarrhea. Antibiotic resistance and increased virulence of strains 
have increased the number of C difficile-related deaths worldwide. The innate 
host response mechanisms to C difficile are not resolved; we propose that 
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) has an innate, protective role in C difficile 
colitis. We studied the impact of C difficile toxins on the regulation of HIF-1 
and evaluated the role of HIF-1alpha in C difficile-mediated 
injury/inflammation.
METHODS: We assessed HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein levels and DNA binding in human 
mucosal biopsy samples and Caco-2 cells following exposure to C difficile 
toxins. We used the mouse ileal loop model of C difficile toxin-induced 
intestinal injury. Mice with targeted deletion of HIF-1alpha in the intestinal 
epithelium were used to assess the effects of HIF-1alpha signaling in response 
to C difficile toxin.
RESULTS: Mucosal biopsy specimens and Caco-2 cells exposed to C difficile toxin 
had a significant increase in HIF-1alpha transcription and protein levels. 
Toxin-induced DNA binding was also observed in Caco-2 cells. Toxin-induced 
HIF-1alpha accumulation was attenuated by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. In 
vivo deletion of intestinal epithelial HIF-1alpha resulted in more severe, 
toxin-induced intestinal injury and inflammation. In contrast, stabilization of 
HIF-1alpha with dimethyloxallyl glycine attenuated toxin-induced injury and 
inflammation. This was associated with induction of HIF-1-regulated protective 
factors (such as vascular endothelial growth factor-alpha, CD73, and intestinal 
trefoil factor) and down-regulation of proinflammatory molecules such as tumor 
necrosis factor and Cxcl1.
CONCLUSIONS: HIF-1alpha protects the intestinal mucosa from C difficile toxins. 
The innate protective actions of HIF-1alpha in response to C difficile toxins be 
developed as therapeutics for C difficile-associated disease.

A pig ligated loop model was used to analyze the in vivo transcriptome response 
of Clostridium difficile. Bacterial RNA from the loops was retrieved at 
different times and was used for microarray analysis. Several 
virulence-associated genes and genes involved in sporulation cascade were 
differentially expressed (DE). In concordance with observed upregulation of 
toxin genes in microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay estimation of total 
toxin showed high amounts of toxin in the loops. Several genes that were absent 
in primary annotation of C. difficile 630 but annotated in a secondary 
annotation were found to be DE. Pathway comparison of DE genes in vitro and in 
vivo showed that when several pathways were expressed in all conditions, several 
of the C. difficile pathways were uniquely expressed only in vivo. The pathways 
observed to be modulated only in this study could be targets of new therapeutic 
agents against C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) results in toxin-induced epithelial injury 
and marked intestinal inflammation. Fecal markers of intestinal inflammation 
correlate with CDI disease severity, but regulation of the inflammatory response 
is poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that C. difficile toxin TcdA 
activates p38 kinase in tissue culture cells and mouse ilium, resulting in 
interleukin-8 (IL-8) release. Here, we investigated the role of phosphorylated 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase (MK2 kinase, 
pMK2), a key mediator of p38-dependent inflammation, in CDI. Exposure of 
cultured intestinal epithelial cells to the C. difficile toxins TcdA and TcdB 
resulted in p38-dependent MK2 activation. Toxin-induced IL-8 and GROα release 
required MK2 activity. We found that p38 and MK2 are activated in response to 
other actin-disrupting agents, suggesting that toxin-induced cytoskeleton 
disruption is the trigger for kinase-dependent cytokine response. Phosphorylated 
MK2 was detected in the intestines of C. difficile-infected hamsters and mice, 
demonstrating for the first time that the pathway is activated in infected 
animals. Furthermore, we found that elevated pMK2 correlated with the presence 
of toxigenic C. difficile among 100 patient stool samples submitted for C. 
difficile testing. In conclusion, we find that MK2 kinase is activated by TcdA 
and TcdB and regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation 
of p38-MK2 in infected animals and humans suggests that this pathway is a key 
driver of intestinal inflammation in patients with CDI.

Clostridium difficile is the etiological agent of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea, a potentially serious condition frequently affecting elderly 
hospitalized patients. While tissue damage is primarily induced by two toxins, 
the mechanism of gut colonization, and particularly the role of bacterial 
adherence to the mucosa, remains to be clarified. Previous studies have shown 
binding of C. difficile whole cells to cultured cell lines and suggested the 
existence of multiple adhesins, only one of which has been molecularly 
characterized. In this paper, we have investigated tissue binding of C. 
difficile surface layer proteins (SLPs), which are the predominant outer surface 
components and are encoded by the slpA gene. The adherence of C. difficile to 
HEp-2 cells was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 
fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, which showed that antibodies to the 
high-molecular-weight (MW) SLP inhibited adherence. Immunohistochemical analysis 
of human gastrointestinal tissue sections revealed strong binding both to the 
surface epithelium lining the digestive cavities and to the subjacent lamina 
propria, while glands were negative. A similar pattern was observed in the 
mouse. By using purified recombinant SLPs, we show that binding is largely 
mediated by the high-MW SLP. By Western blotting analysis, we have identified 
two potential ligands of the C. difficile SLPs, one of which may be specific to 
the gut. By using purified extracellular matrix components immobilized on 
nitrocellulose, we also show SLP binding to collagen I, thrombospondin, and 
vitronectin, but not to collagen IV, fibronectin, or laminin. These results 
raise the possibility that the SLPs play a role both in the initial colonization 
of the gut by C. difficile and in the subsequent inflammatory reaction.

Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and 
has become an urgent public health threat requiring immediate attention. 
Epidemic lineages of the BI/NAP1/027 strain type have emerged and spread through 
health care systems across the globe over the past decade. Limiting 
person-to-person transmission and eradicating C. difficile, especially the 
BI/NAP1/027 strain type, from health care facilities are difficult due to the 
abundant shedding of spores that are impervious to most interventions. Effective 
prophylaxis for C. difficile infection (CDI) is lacking. We have genetically 
modified a contractile R-type bacteriocin ("diffocin") from C. difficile strain 
CD4 to kill BI/NAP1/027-type strains for this purpose. The natural receptor 
binding protein (RBP) responsible for diffocin targeting was replaced with a 
newly discovered RBP identified within a prophage of a BI/NAP1/027-type target 
strain by genome mining. The resulting modified diffocins (a.k.a. Avidocin-CDs), 
Av-CD291.1 and Av-CD291.2, were stable and killed all 16 tested BI/NAP1/027-type 
strains. Av-CD291.2 administered in drinking water survived passage through the 
mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract, did not detectably alter the mouse gut 
microbiota or disrupt natural colonization resistance to C. difficile or the 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), and prevented 
antibiotic-induced colonization of mice inoculated with BI/NAP1/027-type spores. 
Given the high incidence and virulence of the pathogen, preventing colonization 
by BI/NAP1/027-type strains and limiting their transmission could significantly 
reduce the occurrence of the most severe CDIs. This modified diffocin represents 
a prototype of an Avidocin-CD platform capable of producing targetable, 
precision anti-C. difficile agents that can prevent and potentially treat CDIs 
without disrupting protective indigenous microbiota.
IMPORTANCE: Treatment and prevention strategies for bacterial diseases rely 
heavily on traditional antibiotics, which impose strong selection for resistance 
and disrupt protective microbiota. One consequence has been an upsurge of 
opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, that exploit 
antibiotic-induced disruptions in gut microbiota to proliferate and cause 
life-threatening diseases. We have developed alternative agents that utilize 
contractile bactericidal protein complexes (R-type bacteriocins) to kill 
specific C. difficile pathogens. Efficacy in a preclinical animal study 
indicates these molecules warrant further development as potential prophylactic 
agents to prevent C. difficile infections in humans. Since these agents do not 
detectably alter the indigenous gut microbiota or colonization resistance in 
mice, we believe they will be safe to administer as a prophylactic to block 
transmission in high-risk environments without rendering patients susceptible to 
enteric infection after cessation of treatment.

Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 046 is common among neonatal pigs and humans 
in Sweden.

Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 046 was found in 67% of neonatal piglets 
(45/67) sampled from three separate pig-breeding farms in Sweden. Sows from the 
same farms were tested and 50% were colonized in faeces and 30% were colonized 
on skin. An environmental source was suggested because identical PCR ribotypes 
were isolated from faeces as well as externally. Human C. difficile infection 
outbreaks in southern Sweden by the identical PCR ribotype 046 indicate its 
zoonotic potential.

Clostridium difficile TcdB harbors a glucosyltransferase that targets host Rho 
GTPases. However, the role of the enzyme activity in the induction of host 
intestinal disease has not been demonstrated. In this study, we established a 
mouse acute intestinal disease model by cecum injection of wild type and 
glucosyltransferase-deficient TcdB and a chronic model by delivering toxin 
intraluminally via engineered surrogate host Bacillus megaterium. We 
demonstrated, for the first time, that the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdB 
is essential for inducing disease symptoms and intestinal pathological responses 
that resemble human disease, highlighting the importance of targeting toxin 
glucosyltransferase activity for future therapy.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is a recognised cause of typhlocolitis and 
diarrhoea in neonatal pigs but has never been confirmed in association with 
pathology and disease in Irish pigs.
CASE PRESENTATION: Four neonatal piglets, with a history of diarrhoea were 
referred to the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Backweston for necropsy. 
They were from a fully integrated, commercial pig farm with approximately 1000 
sows. Three piglets had acute, superficial, erosive and suppurative 
typhlocolitis and the other had mild suppurative mesocolitis. Clostridium 
difficile (C. difficile) toxins A/B were detected using ELISA in the colonic 
contents from each piglet. C. difficile isolates from two of the piglets were 
PCR-ribotyped as 078 and an isolate from a third pig was ribotyped as 110.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report confirming C. difficile in association 
with typhlocolitis in Irish pigs.

An apparent outbreak of enteric disease occurred in dogs and cats at a 
veterinary teaching hospital. Clostridium difficile Toxin A or B or both were 
identified in 1 or more fecal samples from 48 of 93 (52%) dogs over a 5-month 
period, 30 of which were identified in the 1st 26 days, after which strict 
infection control measures, including closure to elective cases, were 
implemented. Affected animals included in-patients, out-patients that were 
housed temporarily in the wards, and resident blood donor dogs. Infection 
control measures, including partial depopulation, isolation, hospital and yard 
cleaning, and barrier precautions, were instituted, after which, the incidence 
of nosocomial diarrhea decreased from 19 cases per 1,000 admissions to 2.5 cases 
per 1,000 admissions (P < 0.001).

challenge.

Clostridium (C.) difficile is a common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in horses. 
Vancomycin and metronidazole have been used as standard treatments but are only 
moderately effective, which highlights the need for a novel alternative therapy. 
In the current study, we prepared antiserum of equine origin against both C. 
difficile toxins A and B as well as whole-cell bacteria. The toxin-neutralizing 
activities of the antibodies were evaluated in vitro and the prophylactic 
effects of in vivo passive immunotherapy were demonstrated using a conventional 
mouse model. The data demonstrated that immunized horses generated antibodies 
against both toxins A and B that possessed toxin-neutralizing activity. 
Additionally, mice treated with the antiserum lost less weight without any sign 
of illness and regained weight back to a normal range more rapidly compared to 
the control group when challenged orally with 10(7) C. difficile spores 1 day 
after serum injection. These results indicate that intravenous delivery of 
hyperimmune serum can protect animals from C. difficile challenge in a 
dose-dependent manner. Hence, immunotherapy may be a promising prophylactic 
strategy for preventing C. difficile infection in horses.

Clostridium difficile toxin A in rat colon.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nearly all human sera contain an immunoglobulin G antibody 
(antigalactose) that binds the trisaccharide Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc 
expressed on cells from most mammals but not humans. Because the Clostridium 
difficile toxin A receptor in rodents contains this trisaccharide, the aim of 
this study was to examine whether antigalactose could mimic the enterotoxic 
effects of toxin A and bind to receptors containing this trisaccharide.
METHODS: Fluid secretion, [3H]-mannitol permeability, and release of rat mast 
cell protease II and prostaglandin E2 were measured after luminal exposure of 
rat colon to either purified human anti-galactose, control immunoglobulin G, 
toxin A, or buffer.
RESULTS: Toxin A (5 micrograms) and antigalactose (250 micrograms) but not 
control immunoglobulin (250 micrograms) stimulated colonic fluid secretion and 
caused increased mannitol permeability and rat mast cell protease II release. 
Antigalactose and toxin A and, to a lesser degree, control immunoglobulin G also 
stimulated release of prostaglandin E2, but only toxin A produced acute 
inflammation of rat colonic mucosa. Antigalactose and toxin A bound specifically 
to a single class of colonic brush border receptors with dissociation constants 
of 10(-6) mol/L and 5.4 x 10(-8) mol/L, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Fluid secretion, increased permeability, and mast cell activation 
occur in rat colon when toxin A or human antigalactose immunoglobulin G bind to 
receptors bearing the trisaccharide Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc.

We evaluated the operating characteristics of 2 comparably trained dogs as a 
"point-of-care" diagnostic tool to detect toxin gene-positive Clostridium 
difficile. Although each dog could detect toxin gene-positive C difficile in 
stool specimens with sensitivities of 77.6 and 92.6 and specificities of 85.1 
and 84.5, respectively, interrater reliability is only modest (Cohen's kappa 
0.52), limiting widespread application.

Review article: tolevamer, a novel toxin-binding polymer: overview of 
preclinical pharmacology and physicochemical properties.

BACKGROUND: Tolevamer is a novel toxin-binding polymer that is currently being 
investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of patients who have 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea.
AIMS: To summarize the results of in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies of 
tolevamer. In contrast to antibiotics, tolevamer binds C. difficile toxins to 
interrupt toxin-mediated intestinal inflammation and tissue damage, and does not 
demonstrate direct antimicrobial activity.
METHODS: Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were studied in rats and dogs; 
efficacy was studied in a hamster model.
RESULTS: Studies in rats and dogs indicate that tolevamer is essentially 
non-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and show that drug interactions 
with commonly used therapies are unlikely. Pharmacologic studies indicate that 
tolevamer reduces disease severity and recurrence rates in the hamster model of 
C. difficile-associated diarrhoea and blocks the enterotoxic effects of toxin A 
in rat ileum. The binding parameters calculated for the interaction of tolevamer 
with toxins A and B provide a reasonable physicochemical model that supports the 
potential clinical utility of tolevamer.
CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical results are consistent with the effectiveness and 
safety profile of tolevamer observed in clinical studies in patients with C. 
difficile-associated diarrhoea.

[The occurrence of Clostridium difficile in fecal samples of dogs and cats].

[Article in German]

Weber A, Kroth P, Heil G.

Fecal samples of 150 dogs and 175 cats originating from different veterinary 
practices were investigated for assessing the occurrence of Clostridium (Cl.) 
difficile by using a selective medium for cultural isolation. From dogs without 
enteric symptoms 7 (9.3%) of 75 samples were positive for Cl. difficile, with 2 
strains being cytotoxic for bovine embryonic lung fibroblast cells, which could 
be neutralized by Cl. difficile-antitoxin. In samples of 75 dogs with enteric 
symptoms Cl. difficile could be isolated in 2 cases (2.7%). In cats 9 (9%) of 
100 fecal samples deriving from animals without enteric symptoms contained Cl. 
difficile, while in 75 cats with enteric symptoms, the isolation rate was 6.7% 
(5 strains). Of either group only 1 Cl. difficile-strain showed cytotoxicity for 
tissue culture. The results of this study allow to conclude, that in contrast to 
the significance for man Cl. difficile is neither for dogs nor for cats an 
important enteric agent. However these pets can harbour and shed strains of Cl. 
difficile, even cytotoxigenic ones, in faeces. In view of these findings the 
possibility of occasional human infections by household dogs or cats needs 
attention and further investigation.

The current treatment paradigm in Clostridium difficile infection is the 
administration of antibiotics contributing to the high rates of recurrent 
infections. Recent alternative strategies, such as fecal microbiome 
transplantation and anti-toxin antibodies, have shown similar efficacy in the 
treatment of C. difficile associated disease (CDAD). However, barriers exist for 
either treatment or other novel treatments to displace antibiotics as the 
standard of care. To aid in the comparison of these and future treatments in 
CDAD, we developed an in silico pipeline to predict clinical efficacy with 
nonclinical results. The pipeline combines an ordinary differential equation 
(ODE)-based model, describing the immunological and microbial interactions in 
the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, with machine learning algorithms to translate 
simulated output quantities (i.e. time of clearance, quantity of commensal 
bacteria, T cell ratios) into clinical predictions based on prior preclinical, 
translational and clinical trial data. As a use case, we compare the efficacy of 
lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), a novel immunoregulatory target with 
promising efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), activation with 
antibiotics, fecal microbiome transplantation and anti-toxin antibodies in the 
treatment of CDAD. We further validate the potential of LANCL2 pathway 
activation, in a mouse model of C. difficile infection in which it displays an 
ability to decrease weight loss and inflammatory cell types while protecting 
against mortality. The computational pipeline can serve as an important resource 
in the development of new treatment modalities.

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in the 
United States, adding billions of dollars per year to health care costs. A 
vaccine targeted against the bacterium would be extremely beneficial in 
decreasing the morbidity and mortality caused by C. difficile-associated 
disease; a vaccine directed against a colonization factor would hinder the 
spread of the bacterium as well as prevent disease. Type IV pili (T4Ps) are 
extracellular appendages composed of protein monomers called pilins. They are 
involved in adhesion and colonization in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea, 
and are putative colonization factors in C. difficile. We hypothesized that 
vaccinating mice with pilins would lead to generation of anti-pilin antibodies, 
and would protect against C. difficile challenge. We found that immunizing 
C57Bl/6 mice with various pilins, whether combined or as individual proteins, 
led to low anti-pilin antibody titers and no protection upon C. difficile 
challenge. Passive transfer of anti-pilin antibodies led to high serum 
anti-pilin IgG titers, but to undetectable fecal anti-pilin IgG titers and did 
not protect against challenge. The low antibody titers observed in these 
experiments may be due to the particular strain of mice used. Further 
experiments, possibly with a different animal model of C. difficile infection, 
are needed to determine if an anti-T4P vaccine would be protective against C. 
difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium capable of 
colonizing the gastrointestinal tract of humans following disruption of the 
normal microbiota, typically from antibiotic therapy for an unrelated infection. 
With approximately 500,000 confirmed infections leading to 29,000 deaths per 
year in the United States, C. difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent public 
health threat. We previously determined that C. difficile survives in up to 3% 
oxygen. Low levels of oxygen are present in the intestinal tract, with the 
higher concentrations being associated with the epithelial cell surface. 
Additionally, antibiotic treatment, the greatest risk factor for CDI, increases 
the intestinal oxygen concentration. Therefore, we hypothesized that the C. 
difficile genome encodes mechanisms for survival during oxidative stress. 
Previous data have shown that cysteine desulfurases involved in iron-sulfur 
cluster assembly are involved in protecting bacteria from oxidative stress. In 
this study, deletion of a putative cysteine desulfurase (Cd630_12790/IscS2) 
involved in the iron-sulfur cluster (Isc) system caused a severe growth defect 
in the presence of 2% oxygen. Additionally, this mutant delayed colonization in 
a conventional mouse model of CDI and failed to colonize in a germfree model, 
which has higher intestinal oxygen levels. These data imply an undefined role 
for this cysteine desulfurase in protecting C. difficile from low levels of 
oxygen in the gut.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal inflammation is associated with increased 
synthesis of nitric oxide, whereas inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) reduces 
experimental chronic intestinal inflammation. The aim of this study was to test 
the effects of NO blockers and donors on acute intestinal inflammation induced 
by Clostridium difficile toxin A in rat ileum.
METHODS: Rats received NOS inhibitors or NO donors before measurement of 
toxin-mediated ileal secretion and permeability changes. Mucosal mast cell and 
neutrophil activity were measured by release of rat mast cell protease II and 
myeloperoxidase activity, respectively.
RESULTS: NOS inhibitors augmented but an NO donor inhibited toxin A-mediated 
ileal secretion and permeability when given before but not after toxin 
administration. Neither an NOS inhibitor nor an NO donor had any effect on 
cholera toxin-mediated secretion. Mast cell degranulation and neutrophil 
infiltration occurred after injection of toxin A or an NOS inhibitor, whereas 
the NO donor blocked both toxin A effects.
CONCLUSIONS: NOS inhibitors augmented and an NO donor blocked the intestinal 
effects of toxin A but not of cholera toxin. NO protects against toxin A by 
inhibition of intestinal mast cells and neutrophils, which are activated by 
toxin A, but not by cholera toxin.

Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like 
regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency 
is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the 
healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. 
Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile 
acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various 
intestinal bile acid species play an important role in the resistance to 
intestinal colonization by pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. Antibiotic 
therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of 
protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile acid transformation is 
7α-dehydroxylation, producing deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). 
The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow 
phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is 
Clostridium scindens. Like many other intestinal commensal species, 
7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied in vivo. Conventional animals 
contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms 
that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a 
specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the 
present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse 
model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse 
microbiota" (Oligo-MM12). It is representative of the major murine intestinal 
bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the 
Oligo-MM12 consortium carries out bile acid deconjugation, a prerequisite for 
7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to C. difficile infection (CDI). 
Amendment of Oligo-MM12 with C. scindens normalized the large intestinal bile 
acid composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only 
minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM12, but significantly 
decreased early large intestinal C. difficile colonization and pathogenesis. The 
delayed pathogenesis of C. difficile in C. scindens-colonized mice was 
associated with breakdown of cecal microbial bile acid transformation.

Many reports have shown that crude extracts of the American cockroach have 
therapeutic effects on inflammation. In a previous study, our research group 
showed that an antimicrobial peptide (Periplanetasin-2) derived from the 
American cockroach via de novo transcriptome analysis inhibited apoptosis of 
human colonocytes and inflammatory responses of the mouse gut caused by 
Clostridium difficile toxin A. Here, we examined whether Periplanetasin-4 
(Peri-4), another antimicrobial peptide identified via de novo transcriptome 
analysis of the American cockroach, could also inhibit the various toxicities 
induced by C. difficile toxin A. We found that Peri-4 significantly reduced the 
cell viability loss and cell apoptosis caused by toxin A in vitro. Peri-4 also 
ameliorated the severe inflammatory responses seen in the toxin A-induced mouse 
enteritis model, rescuing the villus disruption and interleukin-6 production 
induced by luminal injection of toxin A into the mouse gut. Mechanistically, we 
found that Peri-4 could reduce toxin A-induced reactive oxygen species 
production to inhibit the activations of p38MAPK and p21Cip1/Waf1 , which are 
critical for the cell damages induced by toxin A. These results collectively 
suggest that the Peri-4 may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating toxin 
A-induced pseudomembranous colitis. Copyright © 2017 European Peptide Society

Fourteen dogs had shown chronic or intermittent diarrhea for more than 1 year. 
Diarrhea had been successfully treated with tylosin for at least 6 months but 
recurred when treatment was withdrawn on at least 2 occasions. 
Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) affects typically middle-aged, large-breed 
dogs and clinical signs indicate that TRD affects both the small and large 
intestine. Treatment with tylosin eliminated diarrhea in all dogs within 3 days 
and in most dogs within 24 hours. Tylosin administration controlled diarrhea in 
all dogs, but after it was discontinued, diarrhea reappeared in 12 (85.7%) of 14 
dogs within 30 days. Prednisone given for 3 days did not completely resolve 
diarrhea. Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG did not prevent the relapse of 
diarrhea in any of 9 dogs so treated. The etiology of TRD, a likely form of 
antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD) is unclear. The following reasons for 
chronic diarrhea were excluded or found to be unlikely: parasites, exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial 
overgrowth, enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., 
Yersinia spp., or Lawsoni intracellularis), and Clostridium perfringens 
enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile A toxin. A possible etiologic factor is a 
specific enteropathogenic organism that is a common resident in the canine 
gastrointestinal tract and is sensitive to tylosin but difficult to eradicate. 
Additional studies are required to identify the specific cause of TRD.

Clostridium difficile is emerging as pathogen in both humans and animals. In 
2000 it was described as one of the causes of neonatal enteritis in piglets, and 
it is now the most common cause of neonatal diarrhea in the United States. In 
Europe, C. difficile infection (CDI) in both neonatal piglets and adult sows has 
also been reported. Diagnosis of this infection is based on detection of the 
bacterium C. difficile or its toxins A and B. Most detection methods, however, 
are only validated for diagnosing human infections. In this study three 
commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and a commercial real-time-PCR 
(Becton, Dickinson, and Company) were evaluated by testing 172 pig fecal 
specimens (139 diarrheic and 33 nondiarrheic piglets). The results of each test 
were compared to those of cytotoxicity assays (CTAs) and toxigenic culture as 
the "gold standards." Compared to CTAs, the sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were, respectively, 
as follows: for real-time PCR, 91.6, 37.1, 57.6, and 82.5%; for Premier Toxins 
A&B (Meridian), 83.1, 31.5, 53.1, and 66.7%; for ImmunoCard Toxins A&B kit 
(ICTAB; Meridian), 86.6, 56.8, 66.9, and 80.7%; and for VIDAS (bioMérieux), 
54.8, 92.6, 85.0, and 72.8%. Compared to toxigenic culture, the sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, and NPV were, respectively, as follows: for real-time PCR, 
93.0, 34.7, 50.0, and 87.5%; for Premier Toxins A&B, 80.3, 27.7, 43.8, and 
66.7%; and for ICTAB, 80.0, 46.2, 52.8, and 75.4%; and for VIDAS, 56.4, 89.8, 
77.5, and 76.7%. We conclude that all tests had an unacceptably low performance 
as a single test for the detection of C. difficile in pig herds and that a 
two-step algorithm is necessary, similar to that in cases of human CDI. Of all 
of the assays, the real-time PCR had the highest NPV compared to both reference 
methods and is therefore the most appropriate test to screen for the absence of 
C. difficile in pigs as a first step in the algorithm. The second step would be 
a confirmation of the positive results by toxigenic culture.

Hawa'i, Hilo, HI 96720, USA. kehauhowe@gmail.com

A 23-year-old man living on the island of Hawa'i developed a life threatening 
case of eosinophilic meningitis caused by infection with Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis (rat lungworm disease: RLWD). He was comatose for 3 months, 
incurring brain and nerve damage sufficiently extensive that he was not expected 
to recover. The case was complicated by secondary infections of 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and 
pneumonia, which resulted in an empyema requiring a thoracoscopy and 
decortication. He was treated with prednisone, mebendozal, and pain medication 
for RLWD, and antibiotics and antifungal medications for the secondary 
infections. The administration of herbal supplements was requested by the family 
and approved, and these were administered through a gastric tube. Less than a 
month after being declared in a persistent vegetative state the man was able to 
talk, eat, and had regained some muscle functions. After release from the 
hospital he continued the use of supplements and received treatments of 
intravenous vitamin therapy. Four years after onset of the illness he is able to 
ride a bicycle, is a part time student, plays guitar, and is fluent in two 
foreign languages. RLWD is an emerging tropical disease of growing importance in 
Hawa'i.

Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of the most frequently reported 
nosocomial diarrhea worldwide. The high incidence of recurrent infection is the 
main clinical challenge of C. difficile infections (CDI). Formation of C. 
difficile spores of the epidemic strain R20291 has been shown to be essential 
for recurrent infection and transmission of the disease in a mouse model. 
However, the underlying mechanisms of how these spores persist in the colonic 
environment remains unclear. In this work, we characterized the adherence 
properties of epidemic R20291 spores to components of the intestinal mucosa, and 
we assessed the role of the exosporium integrity in the adherence properties by 
using cdeC mutant spores with a defective exosporium layer. Our results showed 
that spores and vegetative cells of the epidemic R20291 strain adhered at high 
levels to monolayers of Caco-2 cells and mucin. Transmission electron 
micrographs of Caco-2 cells demonstrated that the hair-like projections on the 
surface of R20291 spores are in close proximity with the plasma membrane and 
microvilli of undifferentiated and differentiated monolayers of Caco-2 cells. 
Competitive-binding assay in differentiated Caco-2 cells suggests that 
spore-adherence is mediated by specific binding sites. By using spores of a cdeC 
mutant we demonstrated that the integrity of the exosporium layer determines the 
affinity of adherence of C. difficile spores to Caco-2 cells and mucin. Binding 
of fibronectin and vitronectin to the spore surface was concentration-dependent, 
and depending on the concentration, spore-adherence to Caco-2 cells was 
enhanced. In the presence of an aberrantly-assembled exosporium (cdeC spores), 
binding of fibronectin, but not vitronectin, was increased. Notably, independent 
of the exosporium integrity, only a fraction of the spores had fibronectin and 
vitronectin molecules binding to their surface. Collectively, these results 
demonstrate that the integrity of the exosporium layer of strain R20291 
contributes to selective spore adherence to components of the intestinal mucosa.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Clostridium difficile 
toxin A (TxA) on intestinal epithelial cell migration, apoptosis, and 
transepithelial resistance and to evaluate the effect of glutamine (Gln) and its 
stable derivative, alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln), on TxA-induced damage. Migration 
was measured in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) 6 and 24 hr after a 
razor scrape of the cell monolayer. Cell proliferation was indirectly measured 
utilizing the tetrazolium salt WST-1. The cells were incubated with TxA (1-100 
ng/ml) in medium without Gln or medium containing Gln or Ala-Gln (1-30 mM). 
Apoptosis was quantified in IEC-6 cells using annexin V assay. Transepithelial 
resistance was measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter across T84 cells seeded 
on a transwell filter. TxA-induced a dose-dependent reduction of migration and 
also caused dose and time-dependent apoptosis in IEC-6 cells. Gln and Aln-Gln 
significantly enhanced IEC-6 cell migration and proliferation. Gln and Ala-Gln 
also prevented the inhibition of migration, apoptosis, and the initial drop in 
transepithelial resistance induced by TxA. In conclusion, both peptides reduced 
toxin-induced epithelial damage and thus might play an adjunctive role in C. 
difficile-induced colitis therapy.

Soft feces and a decreased delivery rate were observed in a 
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C3H-scid mouse breeding colony. Grossly, the ceca 
were shrunken and edematous in the affected mice. Histopathologically, severe 
edema in the cecal submucosa as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells in 
the lamina propria and submucosa of the ceca and colon were observed. No 
pathogenic microorganisms were detected by the routine microbiological tests. By 
anaerobic bacterial-examination, Clostridium (C.) difficile with toxin A was 
isolated from the cecal contents of the affected mice. The mice were diagnosed 
with C. difficile-associated colitis. This case appears to be the first report 
of natural infection with C. difficile in SPF mice with clinical signs.

A molecular characterization of Clostridium difficile isolates from humans, 
animals and their environments.

It is generally accepted that most patients with Clostridium 
difficile-associated diarrhoea acquire the organism from the environment. 
Recently we demonstrated that household pets may constitute a significant 
reservoir of C. difficile through gastrointestinal carriage in up to 39% of cats 
and dogs. These findings suggested that direct transmission from household pets, 
or contamination of the environment by them, may be a factor in the pathogenesis 
of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea. To investigate this possibility, we 
examined isolates of C. difficile from humans, pets and the environment by 
restriction enzyme analysis (REA) and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) typing using enhanced chemiluminescence. Both REA and RFLP typing methods 
used Hind III digests of chromosomal DNA. A total of 116 isolates of C. 
difficile from pets (26), veterinary clinic environmental sites (33), humans 
(37) and hospital environmental sites (20) was examined. REA was far more 
discriminatory than RFLP typing and for all isolates there were 34 REA types 
versus 6 RFLP types. There was good correlation between the REA types found in 
isolates from pets and from the veterinary clinic environment, and between 
isolates from humans and from those found in the hospital environment. There 
was, however, no correlation between REA type of C. difficile found in pets and 
isolates of human origin. We conclude that there may still be a risk of humans 
acquiring C. difficile from domestic pets as these findings may be the result of 
geographical variation.

The efficacy of oral tigecycline treatment (2 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days) 
of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was evaluated in the gnotobiotic pig 
model, and its effect on human gut microflora transplanted into the gnotobiotic 
pig was determined. Tigecycline oral treatment improved survival, clinical 
signs, and lesion severity and markedly decreased concentrations of Firmicutes 
but did not promote CDI. Our data showed that oral tigecycline treatment has a 
potential beneficial effect on the treatment of CDI.

Clostridium difficile toxin A excites enteric neurones and suppresses 
sympathetic neurotransmission in the guinea pig.

Public Health, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence suggests that the intestinal actions of 
Clostridium difficile toxin A-stimulation of secretion and motility, and an 
acute inflammatory response-have a neurally mediated component.
METHODS: Direct intracellular electrophysiological recording of electrical and 
synaptic behaviour in enteric neurones was performed in the submucous plexus of 
guinea pig small intestine during exposure to the toxin.
RESULTS: Application of toxin A affected both the electrical behaviour of the 
neuronal cell bodies and inhibitory noradrenergic neurotransmission to the cell 
bodies. Altered electrical behaviour included depolarisation and increased 
excitability. Tetrodotoxin or a histamine H(2) receptor antagonist did not 
affect the depolarisation evoked by toxin A. Failure of the histamine antagonist 
to suppress the actions of toxin A is evidence that its actions were not 
mediated by degranulation of intramural mast cells. The action of toxin A on 
neurotransmission was suppression of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials evoked 
in the neuronal cell bodies by stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibres that 
synapsed with the cell bodies. The inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were 
mediated by norepinephrine (noradrenaline) acting at postsynaptic alpha 
adrenoceptors on the cell bodies. Hyperpolarising responses evoked in the cell 
bodies by micropressure application of norepinephrine were unaffected by toxin 
A. This fulfils criteria for a presynaptic inhibitory action of toxin A to 
suppress release of norepinephrine from sympathetic postganglionic axons.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the neural component of the action of toxin A 
involves both direct excitation of enteric neurones and suppression of 
norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibres in the 
enteric nervous system.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) causes nosocomial antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea and colitis in the developed world. Two potent cytotoxins, toxin A 
(TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are the virulence factors of this disease and can be a 
good vaccine candidate against CDI. In the present study, we genetically 
engineered Lactococcus lactis to express the nontoxic, recombinant fragments 
derived from TcdA and TcdB C-terminal receptor binding domains (Tcd-AC and 
Tcd-BC) as an oral vaccine candidate. The immunogenicity of the genetically 
engineered L. lactis oral vaccine delivery system (animal groups LAC and LBC or 
the combination of both, LACBC) was compared with the recombinant TcdA and TcdB 
C-terminal receptor binding domain proteins (animal groups PAC and PBC or the 
combination of both, PACBC), which were expressed and purified from E. coli. 
After the C. difficile challenge, the control groups received PBS or engineered 
L. lactis with empty vector, showed severe diarrhea symptoms and died within 2-3 
days. However, both the oral vaccine and recombinant protein vaccine groups had 
significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases and histopathologic 
lesions than the control sham-vaccine groups (p<0.05) except group LBC which 
only had a 31% survival rate after the challenge. The data of post infection 
survival showed that an average of 86% of animals survived in groups PAC and 
PACBC, 75% of animals survived in group LACBC, and 65% of animals survived in 
group LAC. All of the vaccinated animals produced higher titers of both IgG and 
IgA than the control groups (p<0.05), and the antibodies were able to neutralize 
the cytopathic effect of toxins in vitro. The results of this study indicate 
that there is a potential to use L. lactis as a delivery system to develop a 
cost effective oral vaccine against CDI.

When functioning properly, the intestine is one of the key interfaces between 
the human body and its environment. It is responsible for extracting nutrients 
from our food and excreting our waste products. It provides an environment for a 
host of healthful microbes and serves as a first defense against pathogenic 
ones. These processes require tight homeostatic controls, which are provided by 
the interactions of a complex mix of epithelial, stromal, neural and immune 
cells, as well as the resident microflora. This homeostasis can be disrupted by 
invasive microbes, genetic lesions, and carcinogens, resulting in diseases such 
Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. 
Enormous strides have been made in understanding how this important organ 
functions in health and disease using everything from cell culture systems to 
animal models to human tissue samples. This has resulted in better therapies for 
all of these diseases, but there is still significant room for improvement. In 
the United States alone, 14,000 people per year die of C. difficile, up to 1.6 
million people suffer from IBD, and more than 50,000 people die every year from 
colon cancer. Because these and other intestinal diseases arise from complex 
interactions between the different components of the gut ecosystem, we propose 
that systems approaches that address this complexity in an integrative manner 
may eventually lead to improved therapeutics that deliver lasting cures. This 
review will discuss the use of systems biology for studying intestinal diseases 
in vivo with particular emphasis on mouse models. Additionally, it will focus on 
established experimental techniques that have been used to drive this 
systems-level analysis, and emerging techniques that will push this field 
forward in the future.

Clostridium difficile is a pathogen which is responsible for diarrhea and 
colitis, particularly after treatment with antibiotics. Clinical signs are 
mainly due to two toxins, TcdA and TcdB. However, the first step of pathogenesis 
is the colonization process. We evaluated C. difficile surface proteins as 
vaccine antigens in the hamster model to prevent intestinal colonization. This 
vaccination induced a partial protection of hamsters against death after a C. 
difficile challenge. A proteomic analysis of animal sera allowed us to identify 
proteins which could be responsible for the protection observed. Among these 
proteins, we identified the GroEL heat shock protein. To confirm the role of the 
specific GroEL antibodies in the delayed C. difficile colonization of hamsters, 
we performed an immunization assay in a mouse model. After intranasal 
immunization with the recombinant protein GroEL, we observed a lower C. 
difficile intestinal colonization in the immunized group as compared to the 
control group.

colon carcinoma to toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile.

The effect of toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile on human colon carcinoma 
cells (HT-29, epithelial), rhesus monkey kidney cells (MA-104, epithelial) and 
green monkey kidney cells (VERO, fibroblast) was studied. Both toxins caused 
rounding of HT-29 cells and rounding with projections remaining attached to the 
substrate in MA-104 and VERO cells; however, the sensitivity to each toxin 
varies considerably. Toxin A was detected in ng by VERO, pg by HT-29 and 
fractions of pg by MA-104 cells; for toxin B, pg were detected by VERO, ng by 
MA-104 and micrograms by HT-29 cells. HT-29 cells were grown with galactose to 
allow their differentiation to enterocytes, and their sensitivity to the toxins 
during the process was studied. At early stages, the sensitivity to both toxins 
was similar, and as the differentiation proceeded, the response to both toxins 
decreased continuously, and after 16 days no evident morphological effect was 
observed, even with micrograms amounts of either toxin. In contrast to all cell 
lines reported to date, HT-29 and MA-104 epithelial cells are exquisitely 
sensitive to toxin A and less responsive to toxin B. The rounding of HT-29 by 
these toxins depends on the degree of differentiation of the cell.

This study investigated the use of a newly developed chitosan-Ca pectinate 
microbead formulation for the colon-targeted delivery of anti-A/B toxin 
immunoglobulin of egg yolk (IgY) to inhibit toxin binding to colon mucosa cells. 
The effect of the three components (pectinate, calcium chloride, and chitosan) 
used for the microbead production was examined with the aim of identifying the 
optimal levels to improve drug encapsulation efficiency, swelling ratio, and 
cumulative IgY release rate. The optimized IgY-loaded bead component was pectin 
5% (w/v), CaCl2 3% (w/v), and chitosan 0.5% (w/v). Formulated beads were 
spherical with 1.2-mm diameter, and the drug loading was 45%. An in vitro 
release study revealed that chitosan-Ca pectinate microbeads inhibited IgY 
release in the upper gastrointestinal tract and significantly improved the 
site-specific release of IgY in the colon. An in vivo rat study demonstrated 
that 72.6% of biologically active IgY was released specifically in the colon. 
These results demonstrated that anti-A/B toxin IgY-loaded chitosan-Ca pectinate 
oral microbeads improved IgY release behavior in vivo, which could be used as an 
effective oral delivery platform for the biological treatment of Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI).

There is growing interest in the ability of the intestinal microbiome to 
influence host function within and beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Here we 
review evidence of microbiome-brain interactions in mice and focus on the 
ability to transfer behavioral traits between mouse strains using fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT). Transplantation alters brain chemistry and 
behavior in recipient ex-germ free mice, raising the possibility of using FMT 
for disorders of the central nervous system, and prompting caution in the 
selection of FMT donors for conditions that may include refractory Clostridium 
difficile infection, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in treating recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Bacterial colonization in recipients 
after FMT has been studied, but little is known about the role of the gut fungal 
community, or mycobiota. Here, we show evidence of gut fungal dysbiosis in CDI, 
and that donor-derived fungal colonization in recipients is associated with FMT 
response. CDI is accompanied by over-representation of Candida albicans and 
decreased fungal diversity, richness, and evenness. Cure after FMT is associated 
with increased colonization of donor-derived fungal taxa in recipients. 
Recipients of successful FMT ("responders") display, after FMT, a high relative 
abundance of Saccharomyces and Aspergillus, whereas "nonresponders" and 
individuals treated with antibiotics display a dominant presence of Candida. 
High abundance of C. albicans in donor stool also correlates with reduced FMT 
efficacy. Furthermore, C. albicans reduces FMT efficacy in a mouse model of CDI, 
while antifungal treatment reestablishes its efficacy, supporting a potential 
causal relationship between gut fungal dysbiosis and FMT outcome.

Evaluation of five enzyme immunoassays compared with the cytotoxicity assay for 
diagnosis of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in dogs.

Clostridium difficile-associated-diarrhea (CDAD) is a nosocomial infection in 
dogs. Diagnosis of this infection is dependent on clinical signs of disease 
supported by laboratory detection of C. difficile toxins A or B, or both, in 
fecal specimens via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Unfortunately, to 
the authors' knowledge, commercially available ELISAs have not been validated in 
dogs to date. We evaluated 5 ELISAs done on 143 canine fecal specimens (100 
diarrheic and 43 nondiarrheic dogs) and on 29 C. difficile isolates. The results 
of each ELISA were compared with the cytotoxin B tissue culture assay (CTA). 
Clostridium difficile was isolated from 23% of the fecal specimens. Eighteen of 
the 143 fecal specimens were toxin positive (15 diarrheic and 3 nondiarrheic 
dogs). On the basis of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 
toxin-A and -B genes, 72% of the isolates were toxigenic. The carriage rate of 
toxigenic isolates in diarrheic dogs was higher than that in the nondiarrheic 
dogs; however, these differences were not statistically significant. A good 
correlation was found between CTA, PCR, and culture results. The ELISAs done on 
fecal specimens collected from diarrheic dogs had low sensitivity (7-33%). In 
contrast, ELISA for toxin A or B, or both, performed on toxigenic isolates had 
high sensitivity (93%). These results suggest that commercially available human 
ELISAs are inadequate for the diagnosis of canine C. difficile-associated 
diarrhea when tested on fecal specimens. In contrast, the Premier ToxinA/B and 
Techlab ToxinA/B ELISAs may be useful for the diagnosis of canine CDAD when used 
on toxigenic isolates.

Visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is 
known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare 
settings. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents 
in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across Ontario. 
Between May and July 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized 
questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. One 
specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and 
pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific 
pathogens. All dogs were judged to be in good health. Zoonotic agents were 
isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. The primary pathogen was Clostridium 
difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. Seventy-one 
percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. Extended-spectrum 
beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, 
extended-spectrum cephalosporinase E. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, 
and organisms of the genus Salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. 
Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral 
swabs, and Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. 
Giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while Toxocara 
canis and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, 
respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci, Campylobacter spp., Microsporum canis, group A streptococci, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. Further 
information is needed before the full implications of these findings for 
infection control can be assessed properly.

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea, and recent outbreaks of strains with increased virulence underscore 
the importance of identifying novel approaches to treat and prevent relapse of 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). CDAD pathology is induced by 
two exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, which have been shown to be cytotoxic and, 
in the case of toxin A, enterotoxic. In this report we describe fully human 
monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) that neutralize these toxins and prevent disease 
in hamsters. Transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin genes were used to 
isolate HuMAbs that neutralize the cytotoxic effects of either toxin A or toxin 
B in cell-based in vitro neutralization assays. Three anti-toxin A HuMAbs (3H2, 
CDA1, and 1B11) could all inhibit the enterotoxicity of toxin A in mouse 
intestinal loops and the in vivo toxicity in a systemic mouse model. Four 
anti-toxin B HuMAbs (MDX-1388, 103-174, 1G10, and 2A11) could neutralize 
cytotoxicity in vitro, although systemic toxicity in the mouse could not be 
neutralized. Anti-toxin A HuMAb CDA1 and anti-toxin B HuMAb MDX-1388 were tested 
in the well-established hamster model of C. difficile disease. CDA1 alone 
resulted in a statistically significant reduction of mortality in hamsters; 
however, the combination treatment offered enhanced protection. Compared to 
controls, combination therapy reduced mortality from 100% to 45% (P<0.0001) in 
the primary disease hamster model and from 78% to 32% (P<0.0001) in the less 
stringent relapse model.

Clostridium difficile is the main agent responsible for hospital acquired 
antibiotic associated diarrhoea. In recent years, epidemic strains have emerged 
causing more severe infections. Whilst C. difficile has two major virulence 
factors, toxins TcdA and TcdB, it is generally accepted that other virulence 
components of the bacterium contribute to disease. Previously, it has been 
suggested that flagella expression from pathogenic bacteria might be implicated 
in virulence. In a recent study, we observed an increased mortality in a 
gnotobiotic mouse model when animals were colonized with an isogenic fliC mutant 
constructed in the PCR-ribotype 027 (B1/NAP1) strain R20291, while animals 
survived when colonized by the parental strain or after colonization by other 
high-toxin-producing C. difficile strains. To understand the reasons for this 
increased virulence, we compared the global gene expression profiles between the 
fliC-R20291 mutant and its parental strain using an in vitro and in vivo 
transcriptomic approach. The latter made use of the gnotobiotic mouse model. 
Interestingly, in the fliC mutant, we observed considerable up-regulation of 
genes involved in mobility, membrane transport systems (PTS, ABC transporters), 
carbon metabolism, known virulence factors and sporulation. A smaller but 
significant up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth, fermentation, 
metabolism, stress and antibiotic resistance was also apparent. All of these 
genes may be associated with the increased virulence of the fliC-R20921 mutant. 
We confirmed that the fliC mutation is solely responsible for the observed 
changes in gene expression in the mutant strain since expression profiles were 
restored to that of the wild-type strain in the fliC-complemented strain. Thus, 
the absence of FliC is directly or indirectly involved in the high mortality 
observed in the fliC mutant infected animals. Therefore, we provide the first 
evidence that when the major structural component of the flagellum is 
neutralized, deregulation of gene expression can occur during infection.

Enterotoxins from Clostridium difficile; diarrhoeogenic potency and 
morphological effects in the rat intestine.

The action of toxins A, B, and C from Clostridium difficile was studied in the 
small intestine and colon of rats. All three caused fluid accumulation in the 
small intestine, maximal secretion being induced by 1 micrograms of toxin A, 20 
micrograms of B, and 15 micrograms of C. Both toxins A and C caused shedding of 
epithelial cells from the villi without visible damage to crypt cells; toxin A 
caused further extensive necrosis and bleeding. Toxin B caused secretion without 
visible damage to the epithelial cells, though this activity was unstable and 
decreased significantly after one week of storage. In the colon, toxin A caused 
secretion and shedding of surface epithelial cells without damage to crypt 
cells, toxin C caused only a weak secretion, and toxin B had no effect at all. 
In terms of immunohistochemistry, it was found that toxin A bound to the 
enterocytes at the tips of the villi but not to goblet and crypt cells. The 
complex expression or interaction of the toxins produced by Cl difficile may 
explain the broad spectrum of disease (diarrhoea, colitis, and pseudomembranous 
colitis) associated with this micro-organism.

Bacillus polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic inflammation by promoting 
cytoprotective effects in colitic mice.

of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

Although human consumption of Bacillus polyfermenticus provides several health 
benefits, the probiotic effect of this bacterium against colonic inflammation 
has not yet, to our knowledge, been studied. Therefore, we induced colitis in 
mice by oral or intrarectal administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) or 
trinitrobenzenosulfonic acid (TNBS), respectively, and investigated the effect 
of B. polyfermenticus on colitis. We found that mice treated with DSS or TNBS 
along with B. polyfermenticus had reduced mortality and severity of colitis 
(weight loss, diarrhea, and mucosal damages) than mice treated with DSS or TNBS 
alone. B. polyfermenticus also reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules, 
including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, intercellular adhesion molecule, and 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but enhanced the expression of the antiinflammatory 
cytokine interleukin-10 in the inflamed mouse colon. Moreover, B. 
polyfermenticus suppressed apoptosis both in vivo in inflamed colonic mucosa and 
in vitro in colonic epithelial cells stimulated with apoptosis-inducing agents 
(FasL or Clostridium difficile Toxin A) when the apoptotic response was 
determined by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling 
assay and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or caspase-3, respectively. 
Treating colonic epithelial cells with B. polyfermenticus-conditioned medium 
(BPCM) enhanced cell proliferation and induced the phosphoinositide 
3-kinases/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting that this bacterium can promote 
epithelial cell proliferation. BPCM also promoted the migration of colonic 
epithelial cells. These data suggest that B. polyfermenticus ameliorates colonic 
inflammation by suppressing apoptosis and promoting epithelial cell 
proliferation and migration.

The mechanisms by which Clostridium difficile causes diarrhoea are unknown. The 
expression of putative virulence factors by 44 Clostridium difficile strains 
isolated from patients with and without diarrhoea was studied. Toxins A and B 
were tested in CHO and MRC-5 cells, respectively; adherence was measured in two 
substrates: HEp-2 cells and polystyrene plates. The in vitro expression of 
toxins A and B by strains isolated from patients with diarrhoea was not 
significantly different from that by strains isolated from patients without 
diarrhoea. The ability of adherence to both HEp-2 cells and polystyrene by 
strains isolated from patients with diarrhoea was not significantly different 
when compared with strains isolated from patients without diarrhoea; however, 
strains isolated from adults with diarrhoea seem to adhere to a greater extent 
to both substrates than strains isolated from adults without diarrhoea. Twenty 
three strains which did not produce toxins A and B were tested for 
enterotoxicity in rat small intestine. Eight such strains induced fluid 
accumulation and seven of them were isolated from children. Adherence to cells 
and to polystyrene might be an important virulence factor in strains causing 
diarrhoea in adults; whereas the production of toxins other than A and B might 
be an important pathogenic mechanism in strains causing diarrhoea in children.

Clostridium difficile is the cause of emerging nosocomial infections that result 
in abundant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Thus, the development of a 
vaccine to kill the bacteria to prevent this disease is highly desirable. 
Several recently identified bacterial surface glycans, such as PS-I and PS-II, 
are promising vaccine candidates to preclude C. difficile infection. To 
circumvent difficulties with the generation of natural PS-I due to its low 
expression levels in bacterial cultures, improved chemical synthesis protocols 
for the pentasaccharide repeating unit of PS-I and oligosaccharide substructures 
were utilized to produce large quantities of well-defined PS-I related glycans. 
The analysis of stool and serum samples obtained from C. difficile patients 
using glycan microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharide epitopes revealed humoral 
immune responses to the PS-I related glycan epitopes. Two different vaccine 
candidates were evaluated in the mouse model. A synthetic PS-I repeating unit 
CRM197 conjugate was immunogenic in mice and induced immunoglobulin class 
switching as well as affinity maturation. Microarray screening employing PS-I 
repeating unit substructures revealed the disaccharide Rha-(1→3)-Glc as a 
minimal epitope. A CRM197-Rha-(1→3)-Glc disaccharide conjugate was able to 
elicit antibodies recognizing the C. difficile PS-I pentasaccharide. We herein 
demonstrate that glycan microarrays exposing defined oligosaccharide epitopes 
help to determine the minimal immunogenic epitopes of complex oligosaccharide 
antigens. The synthetic PS-I pentasaccharide repeating unit as well as the 
Rha-(1→3)-Glc disaccharide are promising novel vaccine candidates against C. 
difficile that are currently in preclinical evaluation.

Clostridium difficile is the main cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis in humans and animals. Its pathogenicity is primarily 
linked to the secretion of two exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB). Although great 
progress in the toxic mechanism of TcdA and TcdB has been achieved, there are 
many conflicting reports about the apoptotic mechanism. More importantly, 
apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported in cells treated 
with Shiga toxins-another kind of cytotoxins that can cause diarrhea and 
colitis. Herein we checked whether TcdB can induce ER stress. The results showed 
that recombinant TcdB (rTcdB) activated molecular markers of unfolded protein 
response, suggesting that rTcdB induced ER stress in CT26 cells. However, rTcdB 
did not induce the up-regulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a classic 
mediator of apoptotic ER stress, but it activated the precursor of cysteine 
aspartic acid-specific protease 12 (caspase-12), a controversial mediator of 
apoptotic ER stress. Besides, glucosyltransferase activity-deficient mutant 
recombinant TcdB induced ER stress, though it has no cytotoxic or cytopathic 
effect on CT26 cells. Altogether, these data demonstrated that ER stress induced 
by rTcdB is glucosyltransferase-independent, indicating that ER stress induced 
by rTcdB is non-apoptotic. This work also offers us a new insight into the 
molecular mechanism of CHOP protein expression regulation and the role of CHOP 
expression in ER stress.

A total of 313 faecal samples from three pig farms and two cattle farms was 
collected, and Clostridium difficile was isolated from 133/257 piglet samples 
(51.8%) and from 1/56 calf samples (1.8%). Toxins were tested only in calf 
samples and were positive in 44.6% (25/56). The only bovine isolate belonged to 
toxinotype XIa (A(-)B(-)CDT(+)). Porcine isolates belonged to toxinotype 0 
(A(+)B(+)CDT(-)) and toxinotype V (A(+)B(+)CDT(+)). Of the two ribotypes usually 
found in toxinotype V, the strains isolated in this study showed a greater 
similarity to ribotype 066 than to ribotype 078.

Clostridium difficile is a frequent cause of severe, recurrent post-antibiotic 
diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The surface layer (S-layer) is the 
predominant outer surface component of C. difficile which is involved in 
pathogen-host interactions critical to pathogenesis. In this study, we 
characterized the S-layer protein A (SlpA) of animal and human strains belonging 
to different PCR-ribotypes (PR) and compared the in vitro adherence and in vivo 
colonization properties of strains showing different SlpA variants. Since each 
SlpA variant has been recently associated with an S-layer cassette, we were able 
to deduce the cassette for each of our strains. In this study, an identity of 
99-100 % was found among the SlpA of isolates belonging to PR 012, 014/020, 045 
and 078. One exception was the SlpA of a poultry isolate, PR 014/020, which 
showed 99 % identity with that of strain 0160, another PR 014/020 which contains 
an S-layer cassette 6. Interestingly, this cassette has also been found in a PR 
018 strain, an emerging virulent type currently predominant in Italy. Five other 
SlpA variants (v014/020a-e) were identified in strains PR 014/020. In vitro 
adherence assays and in vivo colonization experiments were performed on five PR 
014/020 strains: human 1064 (v014/020e), human 4684/08 (v014/020b), human IT1106 
(v078a), poultry P30 (v014/020d) and poultry PB90 (v014/020b) strains. Adhesion 
assays indicate that C. difficile strains vary in their capacity to adhere to 
cells in culture and that adhesion seems to be independent of the SlpA variant. 
Colonization properties were assessed in vivo using a dixenic mouse model of 
colonization. The kinetics of faecal shedding and caecal colonization were 
similar when human 4684/08 (v014/020b) strain was compared with human 1064 
(v014/020e) and poultry PB90 (v014/020b) strain. In contrast, poultry P30 
(v014/020d) strain outcompeted both human 4684/08 (v014/020b) and IT1106 (v078a) 
strains and its adherence to caeca at day 7 was significantly higher. The 
peculiar characteristics of C. difficile P30 seem to advantage it in colonizing 
the intestinal mice niche, increasing its ability to compete and adapt. The 
results obtained underline the need of an increased attention to the genetic 
evolution of C. difficile to prevent and limit the consequences of the emergence 
of increasingly virulent strains.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxin A is the principal mediator of 
inflammatory enterocolitis in experimental animals. The purpose of this study 
was to explore the effect of ketotifen, an anti-inflammatory drug, on toxin 
A-induced enterotoxicity in rat ileum.
METHODS: The effects of intragastric administration of ketotifen on secretion, 
mannitol permeability, histological damage, and mucosal levels of leukotriene 
B4, leukotriene C4, and platelet activating factor in toxin A-exposed rat ileal 
loops were measured in vivo. The effects of ketotifen on toxin A-mediated 
release of rat mast cell protease II (rat mucosa mast cell product) release were 
also measured in rat ileal explants in vitro. The effect of ketotifen on 
neutrophil migration in vitro was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Ketotifen pretreatment inhibited toxin A-associated intestinal 
secretion by 42.5% and mannitol permeability by 56.3% and reduced epithelial 
cell inflammation and necrosis. These effects were associated with reduced 
levels of leukotriene B4 by 65.8%, leukotriene C4 by 88.8%, platelet activating 
factor by 77.8%, and inhibition of rat mast cell protease II by 58.4%. In 
addition, pretreatment of neutrophils with ketotifen inhibited neutrophil 
migration in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of ketotifen in this animal model was 
associated with significant inhibition of release of mast cells and neutrophil 
derived mediators, supporting their involvement in C. difficile enteritis.

during normoxic lung ischemia.

Abrupt reduction of flow (ischemia) leads to endothelial cell membrane 
depolarization, NADPH oxidase activation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation in isolated rat and mouse lungs and in flow-adapted endothelial cells 
in vitro. Here we evaluated the role of PI-3-kinase and rac in activation of 
endothelial NADPH oxidase. Endothelium of isolated perfused mouse lungs labeled 
with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H(2)DCF) or hydroethidine (HE) showed 
increased ROS generation with ischemia; these results were supported by TBARS 
measurement in whole-lung homogenate and by in vitro studies using flow-adapted 
mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Ischemia-induced ROS generation 
in intact lung or isolated cells was blocked by pretreatment with Clostridium 
difficile toxin B, a rac inhibitor, and by wortmannin or LY294002, PI3 kinase 
inhibitors. In cells, immunofluorescence and immunoblot after subcellular 
fractionation showed ischemia-induced translocation of rac, p47(phox), and 
p67(phox) to the plasma membrane. Increased extracellular K(+) also resulted in 
rac translocation, providing evidence that this pathway is sensitive to 
alterations of endothelial cell membrane potential. These results indicate that 
PI-3-kinase and the small G protein rac are involved in the activation of 
endothelial cell NADPH oxidase that is associated with the acute loss of shear 
stress.

profile induction in vivo.

PURPOSE: Rho GTPases play a central role in actin-based cytoskeleton 
reorganization and regulate multiple signaling pathways that control gene 
transcription, cell survival, and proliferation. We investigated the effect of 
Rho GTPases on cell cycle regulation and progenitor genes expression on mouse 
ciliary epithelium (CE), a potential source of progenitor/stem cells in the 
adult retina.
METHODS: Rho GTPases were activated by intraocular injection of lysophosphatidic 
acid and inactivated by Clostridium difficile Toxin A (general Rho GTPase 
inhibitor), NSC23766 (Rac1 activation inhibitor), or Y27632 (Rho-associated 
protein kinase [ROCK] inhibitor). Thereafter, we assayed for RhoA, RhoB, and 
Rac1 protein localization in CE cells. Proliferation was examined by the 
expression levels of cell cycle regulators p27(kip), p16(INK4a), and Ki67 and 
the effects on progenitors by determining the changes in Pax6 and Chx10 
progenitor markers expression.
RESULTS: All GTPases investigated were expressed in mouse CE cells. Activation 
increased the coexpression of Pax6 and Chx10, but had no significant effect on 
the proliferation of CE cells. In contrast, Rho GTPases inactivation increased 
cell proliferation and potentiated the proliferative effect of growth factors. 
Specific inactivation of Rac1 or ROCK increased the levels of Ki67 and decreased 
the expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p27(kip) and p16(INK4a).
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports that Rho GTPase modulation (activation and 
inactivation) controls the expression of retinal progenitor genes and 
proliferation, respectively, in the adult ciliary epithelial progenitor/stem 
cells of rodent eyes. The modulation of these two different mechanisms 
(proliferation and reprogramming) may provide a potential new approach in 
retinal repair.

Experiments reported in this communication showed that the highly toxinogenic Cd 
79685, Cd 4784, and Wilkins Clostridium difficile strains and the moderately 
toxinogenic FD strain grown in the presence of blood adhere to polarized 
monolayers of two cultured human intestinal cell lines: the human colonic 
epithelial Caco-2 cells and the human mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells. Scanning 
electron microscopy revealed that the bacteria interacted with well-defined 
apical microvilli of differentiated Caco-2 cells and that the bacteria strongly 
bind to the mucus layer that entirely covers the surface of the HT29-MTX cells. 
The binding of C. difficile to Caco-2 cells developed in parallel with the 
differentiation features of the Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the protein(s) 
which constitute C. difficile-binding sites are differentiation-related brush 
border protein(s). To better define this interaction, we tentatively 
characterized the mechanism(s) of adhesion of C. difficile with adherence 
assays. It was shown that heating of C. difficile grown in the presence of blood 
enhanced the bacterial interaction with the brush border of the enterocyte-like 
Caco-2 cells and the human mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells. A labile 
surface-associated component was involved in C. difficile adhesion since washes 
of C. difficile grown in the presence of blood without heat shock decreased 
adhesion. After heating, washes of C. difficile grown in the presence of blood 
did not modify adhesion. Analysis of surface-associated proteins of C. difficile 
subjected to different culture conditions was conducted. After growth of C. 
difficile Cd 79685, Cd 4784, FD and Wilkins strains in the presence of blood and 
heating, two predominant SDS-extractable proteins with molecular masses of 12 
and 27 kDa were observed and two other proteins with masses of 48 and 31 kDa 
disappeared. Direct involvement of the 12 and 27 kDa surface-associated proteins 
in the adhesion of C. difficile strains was demonstrated by using rat 
polycolonal antibodies pAb 12 and pAb 27 directed against the 12 and 27 kDa 
proteins. Indeed, adhesion to Caco-2 cell monolayers of C. difficile strains 
grown in the presence of blood, without or with heat-shock, was blocked. Taken 
together, our results suggest that C. difficile may utilize blood components as 
adhesins to adhere to human intestinal cultured cells.

intestinal mucosa in experimental models of Clostridium difficile infection.

Bacteraemia and subsequent sepsis is one possible complication of Clostridium 
difficile infection. The aim of this study was to examine a correlation between 
bacterial translocation with morphological changes of intestinal mucosa and 
shifts of intestinal microflora in experimental models of C. difficile 
infection. A mouse model was used to study post-antibiotic shifts and mild C. 
difficile infection, and hamsters were used to study fatal enterocolitis. The 
influence of pro- and pre-biotics (lactobacilli and xylitol) were also studied 
in the hamster model. The quantitative composition of luminal and mucosal 
microflora was evaluated in different intestinal loci, inflammatory changes of 
mucosa were estimated in histological sections and bacterial translocation was 
detected in samples from blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. In 
cases of mild C. difficile infection, the extent of disturbance of intestinal 
microflora appeared to be a more important promoting factor in translocation 
than inflammatory activity in the mucosa. Translocation was frequent in fatal 
enterocolitis, with facultative species predominating in the intestinal mucosa 
and also C. difficile in some cases. The combination of lactobacilli and xylitol 
had some protective effect against C. difficile infection in these models.

The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a member of the order 
Rodentia and the family Sciuridae. Ecologically, prairie dogs are a keystone 
species in prairie ecology. This species is used as an animal model for human 
gallbladder disease and diseases caused by infection with Clostridium difficile, 
Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and most recently, Orthopoxvirus. 
Despite increasing numbers of prairie dogs used in research and kept as pets, 
few data are available on their baseline physiology in animal facility housing 
conditions. To establish baseline physiologic reference ranges, we designed a 
study using 18 wild-caught black-tailed prairie dogs. Telemetry data were 
analyzed to establish circadian rhythms for activity and temperature. In 
addition, hematologic and serum chemistry analyses were performed. Baseline 
measurements were used to establish the mean for each animal, which then were 
compiled and analyzed to determine the reference ranges. Here we present 
physiologic data on serum chemistry and hematology profiles, as well as weight, 
core body temperature, and daily activity patterns for black-tailed prairie 
dogs. These results reflect the use of multiple measurements from species- and 
age-matched prairie dogs and likely will be useful to ecologists, scientists 
interested in using this animal model in research, and veterinarians caring for 
pet prairie dogs.

Saccharomyces boulardii protease inhibits Clostridium difficile toxin A effects 
in the rat ileum.

Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.

Saccharomyces boulardii, a nonpathogenic yeast, is effective in treating some 
patients with Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis. We have previously 
reported that S. boulardii inhibits rat ileal secretion in response to C. 
difficile toxin A possibly by releasing a protease that digests the intestinal 
receptor for this toxin (C. Pothoulakis, C. P. Kelly, M. A. Joshi, N. Gao, C. J. 
O'Keane, I. Castagliuolo, and J. T. LaMont, Gastroenterology 104: 1108-1115, 
1993). The aim of this study was to purify and characterize this protease. S. 
boulardii protease was partially purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and 
octyl-Sepharose. The effect of S. boulardii protease on rat ileal secretion, 
epithelial permeability, and morphology in response to toxin A was examined in 
rat ileal loops in vivo. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis of the purified S. boulardii protease revealed a major band at 
54 kDa. Pretreatment of rat ileal brush border (BB) membranes with partially 
purified protease reduced specific toxin A receptor binding (by 26%). Partially 
purified protease digested the toxin A molecule and significantly reduced its 
binding to BB membranes in vitro (by 42%). Preincubation of toxin A with S. 
boulardii protease inhibited ileal secretion (46% inhibition, P < 0.01), 
mannitol permeability (74% inhibition, P < 0.01), and histologic damage caused 
by toxin A. Thus, S. boulardii protease inhibits the intestinal effects of C. 
difficile toxin A by proteolysis of the toxin and inhibition of toxin A binding 
to its BB receptor. Our results may be relevant to the mechanism by which S. 
boulardii exerts its protective effects in C. difficile infection in humans.

The protein antisecretory factor (AF) inhibits intestinal fluid secretion 
induced by the cholera toxin (CT) and Clostridium difficile toxin A (CDA). The 
present work investigated whether CT-induced AF protects against the enterotoxin 
action by CDA. Rats were pretreated perorally with CT or buffer as control, 
whereafter CDA-induced fluid secretion and cytotoxicity was tested in vivo in 
ligated intestinal loops; the mucosal level of AF was estimated using the 
Western blot technique. Rats given repeated peroral doses of CT became tolerant 
to CDA, the inhibition of fluid secretion and of cytotoxicity being 79% in eight 
out of nine animals. The repeated CT-treatment also induced long-lasting rise of 
AF in the mucosal epithelium. Recombinant AF given either perorally or 
intravenously inhibited both fluid secretion and cytotoxicity by CDA; similar 
results were obtained with a truncated 16-mer AF peptide.
IN CONCLUSION: peroral CT-treatment induced tolerance to CDA in rat small 
intestine. The tolerance was probably mediated by AF induced via action of 
cholera toxin on the enteric nervous and immune system.

Clostridium difficile is a frequent cause of severe, recurrent, post-antibiotic 
diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. Its pathogenicity is mediated mainly by 
two toxins, TcdA and TcdB. However, different adhesins have also been described 
as important colonization factors which are implicated in the first step of the 
intestinal infection. In this study, we focused our interest on one of these 
adhesins, fibronectin-binding protein A (FbpA), and on its role in the 
intestinal colonization process. A mutant of FbpA (CDΔFbpA) was constructed in 
C. difficile strain 630Δerm by using ClosTron technology. This mutant was 
characterized in vitro and in vivo and compared to the isogenic wild-type 
strain. Adhesion of the CDΔFbpA mutant to the human colonic epithelial cell line 
Caco-2 and to mucus-secreting HT29-MTX cells was examined. Surprisingly, the 
CDΔFbpA mutant adhered more than the wild-type parental strain. The CDΔFbpA 
mutant was also analysed in three different mouse models by following the 
intestinal implantation kinetics (faecal shedding) and caecal colonization (7 
days post-challenge). We showed that in monoxenic mice, CDΔFbpA shed C. 
difficile in faeces at the same rate as that of the isogenic wild-type strain 
but its colonization of the caecal wall was significantly reduced. In dixenic 
mice, the shedding rate was slower for the CDΔFbpA mutant than for the isogenic 
wild-type strain during the first days of infection, but no significant 
difference was observed in caecal colonization. Similar rates of intestinal 
implantation and caecal colonization were observed for both strains in assays 
performed in human microbiota-associated mice. Taken together, our data suggest 
that FbpA plays a role in intestinal colonization by C. difficile.

Mechanisms of constitutive and ATP-evoked ATP release in neonatal mouse 
olfactory epithelium.

Lansing, MI 48824, USA.

BACKGROUND: ATP is an extracellular signaling molecule with many ascribed 
functions in sensory systems, including the olfactory epithelium. The 
mechanism(s) by which ATP is released in the olfactory epithelium has not been 
investigated. Quantitative luciferin-luciferase assays were used to monitor ATP 
release, and confocal imaging of the fluorescent ATP marker quinacrine was used 
to monitor ATP release via exocytosis in Swiss Webster mouse neonatal olfactory 
epithelial slices.
RESULTS: Under control conditions, constitutive release of ATP occurs via 
exocytosis, hemichannels and ABC transporters and is inhibited by vesicular 
fusion inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin A and hemichannel and ABC 
transporter inhibitor probenecid. Constitutive ATP release is negatively 
regulated by the ATP breakdown product ADP through activation of P2Y receptors, 
likely via the cAMP/PKA pathway. In vivo studies indicate that constitutive ATP 
may play a role in neuronal homeostasis as inhibition of exocytosis inhibited 
normal proliferation in the OE. ATP-evoked ATP release is also present in mouse 
neonatal OE, triggered by several ionotropic P2X purinergic receptor agonists 
(ATP, αβMeATP and Bz-ATP) and a G protein-coupled P2Y receptor agonist (UTP). 
Calcium imaging of P2X2-transfected HEK293 "biosensor" cells confirmed the 
presence of evoked ATP release. Following purinergic receptor stimulation, ATP 
is released via calcium-dependent exocytosis, activated P2X1,7 receptors, 
activated P2X7 receptors that form a complex with pannexin channels, or ABC 
transporters. The ATP-evoked ATP release is inhibited by the purinergic receptor 
inhibitor PPADS, Clostridium difficile toxin A and two inhibitors of pannexin 
channels: probenecid and carbenoxolone.
CONCLUSIONS: The constitutive release of ATP might be involved in normal cell 
turn-over or modulation of odorant sensitivity in physiological conditions. 
Given the growth-promoting effects of ATP, ATP-evoked ATP release following 
injury could lead to progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation and 
regeneration. Thus, understanding mechanisms of ATP release is of paramount 
importance to improve our knowledge about tissue homeostasis and post-injury 
neuroregeneration. It will lead to development of treatments to restore loss of 
smell and, when transposed to the central nervous system, improve recovery 
following central nervous system injury.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The stem bark of Mammea africana is widely 
distributed in tropical Africa and commonly used in traditional medicine. This 
study aims to identify the active compound in Mammea africana and to evaluate 
its antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol extract from the bark of the Mammea africana was 
separated by liquid-liquid extraction, followed by open column chromatography. A 
principal antimicrobial compound was purified by high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) and its structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The antibacterial 
activity of the purified compound was determined using the broth microdilution 
method against 7 common pathogenic bacteria. The compound was also evaluated for 
cytotoxicity by cell proliferation assay (MTS) using the mouse embryonic 
fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 and the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549.
RESULTS: The purified active compound was determined to be mammea A/AA and was 
found to be highly active against Campylobacter jejuni (MIC=0.5 μg/ml), 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC=0.25 μg/ml), and Clostridium difficile (MIC=0.25 
μg/ml). The compound exhibited significant antiproliferative activities against 
both NIH 3T3 and A549 cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Mammea A/AA isolated from Mammea africana exerts specific inhibitory 
activity against Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 
Campylobacter difficile. Mammea A/AA was also found to exhibit significant 
cytotoxicity against both cancer and normal cell lines.

In order to ascertain the importance of Campylobacter spp., C.difficile, 
C.perfringens and Salmonella as agents of bacterial gastroenteritis in dogs, two 
groups of animals were studied prospectively. The first group consisted of 77 
puppies in 14 litters, with fecal cultures performed weekly for 10 weeks, 
starting at birth. The second group consisted of a kennel population with every 
dog cultured at entry, and at two-month intervals thereafter. Incidence of 
Campylobacter spp. was 32 and 31 per 100 dog-month of observation for healthy 
pups and healthy adult dogs respectively, 46 and 0 for C.difficile, 51 and 36 
for C.perfringens and 6.5 and 1.3 for Salmonella. The incidence of Campylobacter 
spp. in pups peaked at 8 weeks of age. This incidence (43 per 100 dog-months) 
was higher in pups reared together with older dogs than in pups reared without 
contact to other dogs (0 per 100 dog-months). Toxigenic strains of C.difficile 
were found in 61.5% of the healthy neonate dogs. None of the cases of non-watery 
and non-inflammatory diarrhea we observed was associated with any of the 
pathogens studied. Furthermore newly acquired colonization with Campylobacter 
spp. or Salmonella was never associated with episodes of diarrhea. No 
conclusions could be drawn about the role of bacterial pathogens for causation 
of watery or inflammatory diarrhea which were not observed in our study.

Clostridium difficile toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) induce a pronounced systemic 
and intestinal inflammatory response. A(2B) adenosine receptors (A(2B)ARs) are 
the predominant adenosine receptors in the intestinal epithelium. We 
investigated whether A(2B)ARs are upregulated in human intestinal cells by TcdA 
or TcdB and whether blockade of A(2B)ARs can ameliorate C. difficile 
TcdA-induced enteritis and alter the outcome of C. difficile infection (CDI). 
Adenosine receptor subtype (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) mRNAs were assayed in 
HCT-8 cells. Ileal loops from wild-type rabbits and mice and A(2B)AR(-/-) mice 
were treated with TcdA, with or without the selective A(2B)AR antagonist ATL692 
or PSB1115. A murine model of CDI was used to determine the effect of A(2B)AR 
deletion or blockade with the orally available agent ATL801, on clinical 
outcome, histopathology and intestinal interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression from 
infection. TcdA and TcdB upregulated A(2B)AR gene expression in HCT-8 cells. 
ATL692 decreased TcdA-induced secretion and epithelial injury in rabbit ileum. 
Deletion of A(2B)ARs reduced secretion and histopathology in TcdA-challenged 
mouse ileum. Deletion or blockade of A(2B)ARs reduced histopathology, IL-6 
expression, weight loss, diarrhea, and mortality in C. difficile-infected mice. 
A(2B)ARs mediate C. difficile toxin-induced enteritis and disease. Inhibition of 
A(2B)AR activation may be a potential strategy to limit morbidity and mortality 
from CDI.

A Pilot Study on the Contamination of Assistance Dogs' Paws and Their Users' 
Shoe Soles in Relation to Admittance to Hospitals and (In)Visible Disability.

Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, P.O. Box 80178, 
3508 TD Utrecht, The Netherlands.

(1) Background: People with disabilities may benefit from an assistance dog 
(AD). Despite regulations that prohibit the denial of ADs to public places, this 
still occurs on a regular basis. The main argument for denial of access is that 
dogs compromise hygiene with their presence, which could cause a health hazard. 
Meanwhile, people are allowed to walk into and out of public places freely. (2) 
Objective: As a pilot study, to investigate the number of Enterobacteriaceae and 
the presence of Clostridium difficile bacteria on the paws of ADs and pet dogs 
(PDs) as well as the shoe soles of their users and owners. With the results, an 
assessment can be made as to whether measures are required to reduce 
environmental contamination (e.g., in hospitals). (3) Methods: In total, 25 ADs, 
25 PDs, and their 50 users/owners participated in the study. Each participant 
walked their dog for 15-30 min prior to the sampling of the front paws. Each PD 
owner or AD user filled out a general questionnaire about the care of their 
dogs, and AD users were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire on their 
experiences regarding the admittance of their ADs to public places (in 
particular, hospitals). Dutch hospitals were questioned on their protocols 
regarding the admittance of ADs and their visitor numbers, including the 
percentage of AD users, to put these numbers into perspective. (4) Results: Dog 
paws were more often negative for Enterobacteriaceae compared to shoe soles (72% 
and 42%, respectively) and also had significantly lower bacterial counts (mean 
of 3.54log10 and 5.03log10 colony-forming units (CFUs), respectively; p < 0.05). 
This was most distinct in the comparison between PDs and their owners (3.75log10 
and 5.25log10 CFUs; p < 0.05); the numbers were similar between ADs and their 
users (3.09log10 and 4.58log10 CFUs; p = 0.2). C. difficile was found on one 
(4%) AD user's shoe soles. Moreover, 81% of AD users had been denied access with 
their current AD once or several times, the main reason being hygiene. The 
results of the visibly and invisibly disabled were significantly different. The 
number of AD users as opposed to the total number of hospital visitors was 0.03% 
in one hospital and is estimated to be 0.02% in the Netherlands. (5) 
Conclusions: The general hygiene of dogs' paws is far better than that of shoe 
soles, mostly demonstrated by the better general hygiene of PD paws compared 
with their owners' shoe soles; ADs and their users had comparable levels of 
general hygiene. In addition, the number of AD users amongst the total number of 
hospital visitors in the Netherlands is very limited. Thus, hygiene measures to 
reduce any contamination due to dog paws do not seem necessary.

Bacterial infections present a serious challenge to healthcare practitioners due 
to the emergence of resistance to numerous conventional antibacterial drugs. 
Therefore, new bacterial targets and new antimicrobials are unmet medical needs. 
Rhodanine derivatives have been shown to possess potent antimicrobial activity 
via a novel mechanism. However, their potential use as antibacterials has not 
been fully examined. In this study, we determined the spectrum of activity of 
seven rhodanine derivatives (compounds Rh 1-7) against clinical isolates of 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and Candida albicans. We also 
synthesized and tested three additional compounds, ethyl ester and amide of 
rhodanine 2 (Rh 8 and Rh 10, respectively) and ethyl ester of rhodanine 3 (Rh 9) 
to determine the significance of the carboxyl group modification towards 
antibacterial activity and human serum albumin binding. A broth microdilution 
assay confirmed Rh 1-7 exhibit bactericidal activity against Gram-positive 
pathogens. Rh 2 had significant activity against various vancomycin-resistant 
(MIC90 = 4 μM) and methicillin-resistant (MIC90 = 4 μM) Staphylococcus aureus 
(VRSA and MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC = 4 μM) and 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains (MIC90 = 8 μM). The rhodanine 
compounds exhibited potent activity against Bacillus spp., including Bacillus 
anthracis, with MIC range of 2-8 μM. In addition, they had potent activity 
against Clostridium difficile. The most potent compound, Rh 2, at 4 and 8 times 
its MIC, significantly decreased S. epidermidis biofilm mass by more than 35% 
and 45%, respectively. None of the rhodanine compounds showed antimicrobial 
activity (MIC > 128 μM) against various 1) Gram-negative pathogens 
(Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, and Salmonella Typhimurium) or 2) strains of Candida albicans (MIC > 
64 μM). The MTS assay confirmed that rhodanines were not toxic to mouse murine 
macrophage (J774.1A) up to 64 μM, human keratinocytes (HaCat) up to 32 μM, and 
human ileocecal colorectal cell (HRT-18) up to 128 μM. Overall, these data 
suggest that certain rhodanine compounds may have potential use for the 
treatment of several multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory 
disease worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the inflammasome adaptor Pyrin, 
but how FMF mutations alter signaling in FMF patients is unknown. Herein, we 
establish Clostridium difficile and its enterotoxin A (TcdA) as Pyrin-activating 
agents and show that wild-type and FMF Pyrin are differentially controlled by 
microtubules. Diverse microtubule assembly inhibitors prevented Pyrin-mediated 
caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 from mouse macrophages and 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Remarkably, Pyrin inflammasome 
activation persisted upon microtubule disassembly in PBMCs of FMF patients but 
not in cells of patients afflicted with other autoinflammatory diseases. We 
further demonstrate that microtubules control Pyrin activation downstream of 
Pyrin dephosphorylation and that FMF mutations enable microtubule-independent 
assembly of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase 
recruitment domain (ASC) micrometer-sized perinuclear structures (specks). The 
discovery that Pyrin mutations remove the obligatory requirement for 
microtubules in inflammasome activation provides a conceptual framework for 
understanding FMF and enables immunological screening of FMF mutations.

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea 
and pseudomembranous colitis. While the role of toxins in pathogenesis has been 
extensively described, the contribution of surface determinants to intestinal 
colonization is still poorly understood. We focused our study on a novel member 
of the MSCRAMM family, named CbpA (Collagen binding protein A), for its adhesive 
properties towards collagen. We demonstrate that CbpA, which carries an 
LPXTG-like cell wall anchoring domain, is expressed on the bacterial surface of 
C. difficile and that the recombinant protein binds at high affinity to 
collagens I and V (apparent Kd in the order of 10(-9 ) M). These findings were 
validated by confocal microscopy studies showing the colocalization of the 
protein with type I and V collagen fibres produced by human fibroblasts and 
mouse intestinal tissues. However, the collagen binding activity of the 
wild-type C. difficile 630 strain was indistinguishable to the cbpA knock-out 
strain. To overcome this apparent clostridial adherence redundancy, we 
engineered a Lactococcus lactis strain for the heterologous expression of CbpA. 
When exposed on the surface of L. lactis, CbpA significantly enhances the 
ability of the bacterium to interact with collagen and to adhere to 
ECM-producing cells. The binding activity of L. lactis-CbpA strain was prevented 
by an antiserum raised against CbpA, demonstrating the specificity of the 
interaction. These results suggest that CbpA is a newsurface-exposed adhesin 
contributing to the C. difficile interaction with the host.

Clostridium difficile toxin A is known to cause deacetylation of tubulin 
proteins, which blocks microtubule formation and triggers barrier dysfunction in 
the gut. Based on our previous finding that the Clostridium difficile toxin 
A-dependent activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC-6) is responsible for 
tubulin deacetylation and subsequent microtubule disassembly, we herein examined 
the possible effect of potassium acetate (PA; whose acetyl group prevents the 
binding of tubulin to HDAC-6) as a competitive/false substrate. Our results 
revealed that PA inhibited toxin A-induced deacetylation of tubulin and 
recovered toxin A-induced microtubule disassembly. In addition, PA treatment 
significantly decreased the production of IL-6 (a marker of inflamed tissue) in 
the toxin A-induced mouse enteritis model. An in vitro HDAC assay revealed that 
PA directly inhibited HDAC-6-mediated tubulin deacetylation, indicating that PA 
acted as a false substrate for HDAC-6. These results collectively indicate that 
PA treatment inhibits HDAC-6, thereby reducing the cytotoxicity and inflammatory 
responses caused by C. difficile toxin A.

Clostridium difficile, the main cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients, 
produces toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB), which affect intestinal epithelial cell 
survival, proliferation, and migration and induce an intense inflammatory 
response. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine 
affecting enterocyte and immune/inflammatory responses. However, it has been 
shown that exposure of intestinal epithelium to a low concentration of TcdA 
induces the release of TGF-β1, which has a protective effect on epithelial 
resistance and a TcdA/TGF-β signaling pathway interaction. The activation of 
this pathway in vivo has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the role of the TGF-β1 pathway in TcdA-induced damage in a rat 
intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-6) and in a mouse model of an ileal loop. 
TcdA increased the expression of TGF-β1 and its receptor, TβRII, in vitro and in 
vivo TcdA induced nuclear translocation of the transcription factors SMAD2/3, a 
hallmark of TGF-β1 pathway activation, both in IEC cells and in mouse ileal 
tissue. The addition of recombinant TGF-β1 (rTGF-β) prevented TcdA-induced 
apoptosis/necrosis and restored proliferation and repair activity in IEC-6 cells 
in the presence of TcdA. Together, these data show that TcdA induces TGF-β1 
signaling pathway activation and suggest that this pathway might play a 
protective role against the effect of C. difficile-toxin.

The gut microbiome, composed of the microflora that inhabit the gastrointestinal 
tract and their genomes, make up a complex ecosystem that can be disrupted by 
antibiotic use. The ensuing dysbiosis is conducive to the emergence of 
opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. A novel approach to 
protect the microbiome from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis is the use of 
beta-lactamase enzymes to degrade residual antibiotics in the gastrointestinal 
tract before the microflora are harmed. Here we present the preclinical 
development and early clinical studies of the beta-lactamase enzymes, P3A, 
currently referred to as SYN-004, and its precursor, P1A. Both P1A and SYN-004 
were designed as orally-delivered, non-systemically available therapeutics for 
use with intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics. SYN-004 was engineered from P1A, a 
beta-lactamase isolated from Bacillus licheniformis, to broaden its antibiotic 
degradation profile. SYN-004 efficiently hydrolyses penicillins and 
cephalosporins, the most widely used IV beta-lactam antibiotics. In animal 
studies, SYN-004 degraded ceftriaxone in the GI tract of dogs and protected the 
microbiome of pigs from ceftriaxone-induced changes. Phase I clinical studies 
demonstrated SYN-004 safety and tolerability. Phase 2 studies are in progress to 
assess the utility of SYN-004 for the prevention of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea and Clostridium difficile disease.

This survey was undertaken to determine the relative frequency of agents that 
are currently associated with neonatal diarrhea in swine, including Clostridium 
difficile and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The 
subjects for this study were the first 100 live 1-7-day-old piglets submitted to 
the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory with a clinical 
signalment of diarrhea, beginning on January 1, 2000. The evaluation of each pig 
included bacterial culture of a section of ileum, 2 sections of jejunum, and a 
single section of colon; a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) or 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); 
ELISA's for rotavirus and C. difficile toxins; IHC for PRRSV; and microscopic 
examination of ileum, midjejunum, spiral colon, liver, spleen, and lung. Survey 
results demonstrate a decline in the relative number of diagnoses of TGEV, 
Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C compared with retrospective 
data. The combined case frequency rate for these 3 pathogens dropped from 70% in 
1988 to 21% in 2000. This survey also demonstrated the emergence of C. difficile 
as an important pathogen of neonatal swine. Clostridium difficle toxin was 
detected in the colon contents of 29% of the piglets, and at least 1 
toxin-positive animal was identified in 55% of the cases. All 29 C. difficile 
toxin-positive piglets had mesocolonic edema, and colitis was observed in 21 of 
29 toxin-positive animals. PRRSV-positive macrophages were detected in the 
lamina propria of intestinal villi by IHC in 10 piglets with diarrhea. In 6 of 
these cases, PRRSV was the only pathogen detected. Gross and microscopic lung 
lesions were not a reliable indicator of PRRSV infection in these neonatal pigs 
with diarrhea. The addition of tests for C. difficile and PRRSV to a routine 
neonatal diarrhea diagnostic protocol resulted in a significant increase in 
thediagnostic success rate on both individual animal and case bases.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile disease is the leading antibiotic-associated 
cause of diarrhea and nosocomial acquired infection in the western world. The 
per annum burden in the USA alone amounts to 250,000 cases with 14,000 ascribed 
deaths and medical costs in excess of a billion dollars. Novel models for the 
study of C. difficile infection are therefore pertinent.
RESULTS: Germ free C57BL/6 mice gavaged with a healthy human fecal microbiota 
maintained a stable "humanized" microbiota over multiple generations when housed 
under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. As with mice containing a 
conventional microbiota, treatment with a five-antibiotic cocktail followed by a 
single dose of clindamycin renders the animals susceptible to C. difficile 
infection (CDI). Interestingly, after recovery from the initial CDI infection, a 
single intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin is sufficient to induce CDI 
relapse. Relapse of CDI can be induced up to 35 days postinfection after 
recovery from the initial infection, and multiple episodes of relapse can be 
induced.
CONCLUSIONS: This model enables the study of recurrent C. difficile disease in a 
host containing a human-derived microbiota. Probiotic treatments using 
human-derived microbes, either prophylactic or curative, can be tested within 
the model. The identification and testing of human-derived microbial communities 
within a humanized microbiota mouse model may enable a higher rate of successful 
transfer of bacteria-based treatments from the lab to human patients due to the 
microbes involved initiating from, and being adapted to, the human GI tract.

therapy dogs fed raw diets in Ontario and Alberta.

Dogs that participate in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), often called 
'therapy dogs', commonly interact with humans whose immune systems are not 
functioning optimally. The advisability of feeding raw meat (including poultry) 
to these animals remains a highly contentious issue, in spite of increasing 
evidence that raw meat is frequently contaminated with Salmonella. We set out to 
determine if consuming raw meat influences the risk of therapy dogs shedding 
Salmonella and other pathogens. Two hundred healthy therapy dogs from Ontario 
and Alberta were enrolled. Between May 2005 and November 2006, fecal specimens 
were collected from each dog every 2 months for 1 year, along with a log of 
places visited, antimicrobial use within the home, dog health status and diet. 
Specimens were cultured for Salmonella, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum 
cephalosporinase (ESC) Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. Forty (20%) 
of the dogs were reported to have been fed raw meat at some point during the 
year. The incidence rate of Salmonella shedding in the raw meat-fed dogs was 
0.61 cases/dog-year, compared with 0.08 cases/dog-year in dogs that were not fed 
raw meat (P<0.001). Controlling for therapy dog group, the repeated measures, 
and pig ear consumption and diarrhoea in the 2 months prior to specimen 
submission, dogs that consumed raw meat were significantly more likely to test 
positive for Salmonella at least once during the year than dogs that did not eat 
raw meat [odds ratio (OR) 22.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-58.8; P<0.001]. 
Specific Salmonella serovars were more common among dogs that consumed raw meat 
versus those that did not include S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg and S. Kentucky. 
Raw meat consumption was also significantly associated with shedding ESC E. coli 
(OR 17.2; 95% CI 9.4-32.3). No associations between C. difficile, MRSA or VRE 
and consumption of raw meat were detected. We recommend that dogs fed raw meat 
should be excluded from AAI programmes, particularly when the programmes involve 
interaction with humans at high risk of infection or adverse sequelae 
attributable to infection. Furthermore, although AAI dogs may not be 
representative of the general population of dogs, we also recommend that feeding 
of raw meat to dogs is to be avoided in homes where immunocompromised people 
live.

Group VIA PLA2 (iPLA2β) is activated upstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) in pancreatic islet β-cell signaling.

Group VIA phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)β) in pancreatic islet β-cells participates 
in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPase 
(SERCA) inhibitor-induced apoptosis, and both are attenuated by pharmacologic or 
genetic reductions in iPLA(2)β activity and amplified by iPLA(2)β 
overexpression. While exploring signaling events that occur downstream of 
iPLA(2)β activation, we found that p38 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation in 
INS-1 insulinoma cells and mouse pancreatic islets, that this increases with 
iPLA(2)β expression level, and that it is stimulated by the iPLA(2)β reaction 
product arachidonic acid. The insulin secretagogue D-glucose also stimulates 
β-cell p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and this is prevented by the iPLA(2)β inhibitor 
bromoenol lactone. Insulin secretion induced by d-glucose and forskolin is 
amplified by overexpressing iPLA(2)β in INS-1 cells and in mouse islets, and the 
p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 prevents both responses. The SERCA inhibitor 
thapsigargin also stimulates phosphorylation of both β-cell MAPK kinase isoforms 
and p38 MAPK, and bromoenol lactone prevents both events. Others have reported 
that iPLA(2)β products activate Rho family G-proteins that promote MAPK kinase 
activation via a mechanism inhibited by Clostridium difficile toxin B, which we 
find to inhibit thapsigargin-induced β-cell p38 MAPK phosphorylation. 
Thapsigargin-induced β-cell apoptosis and ceramide generation are also prevented 
by the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316. These observations indicate that p38 MAPK is 
activated downstream of iPLA(2)β in β-cells incubated with insulin secretagogues 
or thapsigargin, that this requires prior iPLA(2)β activation, and that p38 MAPK 
is involved in the β-cell functional responses of insulin secretion and 
apoptosis in which iPLA(2)β participates.

RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium 
botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA 
GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by 
C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus 
(C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes 
and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 
5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing 
concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by 
precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant 
(K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence 
titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 
5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by 
Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA 
by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation 
of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes 
directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction 
is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.

In vitro and in vivo adhesive properties of flagella and recombinant flagellin 
FliC and flagellar cap FliD proteins of Clostridium difficile were analyzed. 
FliC, FliD, and crude flagella adhered in vitro to axenic mouse cecal mucus. 
Radiolabeled cultured cells bound to a high degree to FliD and weakly to 
flagella deposited on a membrane. The tissue association in the mouse cecum of a 
nonflagellated strain was 10-fold lower than that of a flagellated strain 
belonging to the same serogroup, confirming the role of flagella in adherence.

Rapid detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in fecal samples was 
accomplished with the magnetic immuno PCR assay (MIPA). Elaborate DNA extraction 
techniques were unnecessary. First, we generated a mouse monoclonal antibody 
(MAb) reactive with only C. difficile, Clostridium sordellii, and Clostridium 
bifermentans. Then, magnetic beads were coated with the MAb, incubated with 
fecal samples to allow binding with C. difficile, extracted from the stool with 
a magnet, and processed in the PCR with primers specific for the toxin B gene. 
After optimizing MIPA by raising the number of PCR cycles from 35 to 40 and 
adding Chelex 100 to the PCR mixture, we found a sensitivity of 96.7%, a 
specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative 
predictive value of 94.1% when compared with the culture of cytotoxic C. 
difficile from fecal samples. MIPA is a rapid, easy, and sensitive PCR method 
for demonstrating the presence of toxigenic C. difficile in stool samples and 
avoids the disadvantage of elaborate extraction of DNA from fecal samples.

The novel antibiotic MBX-500, dosed at 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg twice daily for 7 
days, was evaluated for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 
in the gnotobiotic pig model. MBX-500 increased survival at all doses and at 
high doses improved clinical signs and reduced lesion severity, similar to 
vancomycin. Our results show that MBX-500 is an effective antibiotic for the 
treatment of diarrhea associated with CDI and prevents severe systemic disease.

Clostridium difficile disease in hamsters.

Clostridium difficile is the bacterial pathogen identified as the cause of 
pseudomembranous colitis and is principally responsible for nosocomial 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. The pathologic findings associated 
with this infection are believed to be caused by two large (approximately 
300-kDa) exotoxins, toxins A and B. Because of the mucosal nature of this 
infection, vaccination strategies aimed at providing prophylactic or therapeutic 
immune protection have included immunization by mucosal routes. Using the 
hamster model of C. difficile infection, we examined the protective efficacy of 
inactivated toxin (toxoid) vaccine formulations prepared as either culture 
filtrate or partially purified toxoid. We compared combination parenteral and 
mucosal vaccination regimens involving intranasal, intragastric, or rectal 
routes of immunization and found that rectal immunization in conjunction with 
intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination provided full protection of hamsters from death 
and diarrhea while the other mucosal routes did not. Protection was associated 
with high levels of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in serum. The requirement for 
adjuvants for protection was assessed by using sequential i.m. and rectal or 
i.m. vaccination regimens. Unexpectedly, i.m. immunization without adjuvant 
conferred the highest protection from death and diarrhea; this regimen elicited 
the highest serum anti-toxin B titers as well as toxin B neutralizing titers. 
Passive transfer of mouse antitoxin antibodies protected hamsters in a 
dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the principal role of circulating antitoxin 
antibodies in immunity from this toxin-mediated mucosal disease. These results 
suggest that prophylactic parenteral vaccination or intravenous immunotherapy 
could provide protection from C. difficile disease in humans.

Hypotonicity induces membrane protrusions and actin remodeling via activation of 
small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 in Rat-1 fibroblasts.

An important consequence of cell swelling is the reorganization of the F-actin 
cytoskeleton in different cell types. We demonstrate in this study by means of 
rhodamine-phalloidin labeling and fluorescence microscopy that a drastic 
reorganization of F-actin occurs in swollen Rat-1 fibroblasts: stress fibers 
disappear and F-actin patches are formed in peripheral extensions at the cell 
border. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of both Rac and Cdc42, members 
of the family of small Rho GTPases, forms the link between the hypotonic 
stimulation and F-actin reorganization. Indeed, inhibition of the small GTPases 
RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (by Clostridium difficile toxin B) prevents the 
hypotonicity-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas 
inhibition of RhoA alone (by C. limosum C3 exoenzyme) does not preclude this 
rearrangement. Second, a direct activation and translocation toward the actin 
patches underneath the plasma membrane is observed for endogenous Rac and Cdc42 
(but not for RhoA) during cell swelling. Finally, transfection of Rat-1 
fibroblasts with constitutively active RhoA, dominant negative Rac, or dominant 
negative Cdc42 abolishes the swelling-induced actin reorganization. 
Interestingly, application of cRGD, a competitor peptide for 
fibronectin-integrin association, induces identical membrane protrusions and 
changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton that are also inhibited by C. difficile 
toxin B and dominant negative Rac or Cdc42. Moreover, cRGD also induces a 
redistribution of endogenous Rac and Cdc42 to the newly formed submembranous 
F-actin patches. We therefore conclude that hypotonicity and cRGD remodel the 
F-actin cytoskeleton in Rat-1 fibroblasts in a Rac/Cdc42-dependent way.

Clostridium difficile toxin A is known to cause actin disaggregation through the 
enzymatic inactivation of intracellular Rho proteins. Based on the rapid and 
severe cell rounding of toxin A-exposed cells, we speculated that toxin A may be 
involved in post-translational modification of tubulin, leading to microtubule 
instability. In the current study, we observed that toxin A strongly reduced 
α-tubulin acetylation in human colonocytes and mouse intestine. Fractionation 
analysis demonstrated that toxin A-induced α-tubulin deacetylation yielded 
monomeric tubulin, indicating the presence of microtubule depolymerization. 
Inhibition of the glucosyltransferase activity against Rho proteins of toxin A 
by UDP-2',3'-dialdehyde significantly abrogated toxin A-induced α-tubulin 
deacetylation. In colonocytes treated with trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of 
the HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase, toxin A-induced α-tubulin deacetylation and loss 
of tight junction were completely blocked. Administration of TSA also attenuated 
proinflammatory cytokine production, mucosal damage, and epithelial cell 
apoptosis in mouse intestine exposed to toxin A. These results suggest that 
toxin A causes microtubule depolymerization by activation of HDAC6-mediated 
tubulin deacetylation. Indeed, blockage of HDAC6 by TSA markedly attenuates 
α-tubulin deacetylation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and mucosal damage 
in a toxin A-induced mouse enteritis model. Tubulin deacetylation is an 
important component of the intestinal inflammatory cascade following toxin 
A-mediated Rho inactivation in vitro and in vivo.

Previous experiments using cultured endothelial monolayers indicate that 
Rho-family small GTPases are involved in modulation of endothelial monolayer 
permeability by regulating assembly of the cellular actin filament scaffold, 
activity of myosin-based contractility and junctional distribution of the 
Ca2+-dependent endothelial cell adhesion molecule, VE-cadherin. We investigated 
these mechanisms using both cultured endothelial cells (from porcine pulmonary 
artery and mouse heart) and vascular endothelium in situ (mouse aorta, and 
individually perfused venular microvessels of mouse and rat mesentery). Exposure 
to Clostridium difficile toxin B (100 ng x ml(-1)) inactivated 50-90% of all 
endothelial Rho proteins within 60-90 min. This was accompanied by considerable 
reduction of actin filament stress fibres and junctional F-actin in cultured 
endothelial monolayers and in mouse aortic endothelium in situ. Also, 
VE-cadherin became discontinuous along endothelial junctions. Inhibition of Rho 
kinase with Y-27632 (30 microM) for 90-120 min induced F-actin reduction both in 
vitro and in situ but did not cause redistribution or reduction of VE-cadherin 
staining. Perfusion of microvessels with toxin B increased basal hydraulic 
permeability (L(p)) but did not attenuate the transient increase in L(p) of 
microvessels exposed to bradykinin. Perfusion of microvessels with Y-27632 (30 
microM) for up to 100 min reduced basal L(p) but did not attenuate the 
permeability increase induced by platelet activating factor (PAF) or bradykinin. 
These results show that toxin B-mediated reduction of endothelial barrier 
properties is due to inactivation of small GTPases other than RhoA. Rho proteins 
as well as RhoA-mediated contractile mechanisms are not involved in bradykinin- 
or PAF-induced hyperpermeability of intact microvessels.

Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a stromal cell-derived cytokine with several 
biological activities against hematopoietic cells. Recent results indicated that 
IL-11 reduced mucosal damage in animal models of colitis. This study aimed to 
explore the action of recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) on the intestinal 
effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory enterotoxin, and 
cholera toxin, a noninflammatory enterotoxin in rat ileum. We administered 
rhIL-11 subcutaneously to rats before injection of toxin A into ileal loops and 
measured fluid secretion, epithelial permeability to mannitol, histopathological 
damage, and release of rat mast cell protease II (RMCP II) from intestinal mast 
cells and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and macrophage inflammatory 
protein-2 (MIP-2) from lamina propria macrophages. rhIL-11 (50-1,000 
micrograms/kg) inhibited toxin A but not cholera toxin-mediated secretion and 
permeability in a dose-dependent fashion and reduced toxin A-induced epithelial 
cell damage. Rats treated with rhIL-11 also showed reduced RMCP II, TNF-alpha, 
and MIP-2 release in response to toxin A. Exposure of rat peripheral monocytes 
in vitro to rhIL-11 (1 microgram/ml) inhibited lipopolysaccharide and toxin 
A-mediated increases in TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels. We conclude that 
rhIL-11 blocks the intestinal effects of C. difficile toxin A, possibly by 
inhibiting release of inflammatory mediators from mucosal mast cells and 
intestinal macrophages.

We have investigated the ability of a recombinant protein (REP231), derived from 
Clostridium difficile toxin A C-terminal domain, to protect against toxin A 
(TcdA) intoxication in vitro and in vivo. REP231 was cloned, expressed and 
purified by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography, and demonstrated identical 
binding properties to TcdA. Immunofluorescence experiments and in vitro 
cytotoxicity assays using mouse teratocarcinoma cells F9 showed that specific 
binding of TcdA to F9 cells through its C-terminal domain is essential for 
producing cytotoxic effects. TcdA binding and cytotoxicity was inhibited by 
REP231 and a monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal domain. Toxin B 
did not bind to F9 cells and was consequently inactive in cytotoxicity assays. 
Inhibition studies with lectins and a Le(x)-specific antibody supported earlier 
findings that a terminal galactose is part of the bound saccharide but excluded 
Le(x) as a receptor for TcdA. Mice immunised with REP231 were protected against 
a threefold lethal dose of TcdA. Thus, REP231 appeared to be a suitable 
candidate to develop an alternative therapeutic agent, which is able to 
neutralise carbohydrate-mediated TcdA binding and might act as a vaccine.

Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) plays an important role in neutral Na(+) transport 
in mammalian epithelial cells. The Rho family of small GTPases and the PDZ 
(PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain-based adaptor Shank2 are known to regulate the 
membrane expression and activity of NHE3. In this study we examined the role of 
betaPix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho GTPase and a strong 
binding partner to Shank2, in NHE3 regulation using integrated molecular and 
physiological approaches. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that 
NHE3, Shank2, and betaPix form a macromolecular complex when expressed 
heterologously in mammalian cells as well as endogenously in rat colon, kidney, 
and pancreas. In addition, these proteins co-segregated at the apical surface of 
rat colonic epithelial cells, as detected by immunofluorescence staining. When 
expressed in PS120/NHE3 cells, betaPix increased membrane expression and basal 
activity of NHE3. Interestingly, the effects of betaPix on NHE3 were abolished 
by cotransfection with dominant-negative Shank2 mutants and by treatment with 
Clostridium difficile toxin B, a Rho GTPase inhibitor, indicating that Shank2 
and Rho GTPases are involved in betaPix-mediated NHE3 regulation. Knockdown of 
endogenous betaPix by RNA interference decreased Shank2-induced increase of NHE3 
membrane expression in HEK 293T cells. These results indicate that betaPix 
up-regulates NHE3 membrane expression and activity by Shank2-mediated 
protein-protein interaction and by activating Rho GTPases in the apical regions 
of epithelial cells.

Purification and characterization of Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and 
cross-reactivity with Clostridium difficile cytotoxin.

Popoff MR.

Lethal toxin (LT) was purified from Clostridium sordellii IP82 by 
DEAE-Trisacryl, Ultrogel AcA3-4 gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite column 
chromatography. The molecular weight of purified LT was estimated to be 240,000 
to 250,000, and the pI was at pH 4.55. LT was lethal for mice by intraperitoneal 
injection (3.4 X 10(5) mouse lethal doses per mg of protein), cytotoxic for Vero 
cells (6.1 X 10(4) cytotoxic units per mg of protein), erythematous and 
edematous by intradermal injection in guinea pigs, and induced a moderate fluid 
accumulation in the guinea pig intestinal loop test. The lethal activity was 
inactivated by N-bromosuccinimide, N-chlorosuccinimide, chloramine-T, and sodium 
dodecyl sulfate. The data suggest that tryptophan and methionine residues 
present in the toxin are important for lethal activity. Furthermore, LT was 
inactivated by oxidized glutathione and activated by dithiothreitol. 
Inactivation by sulfhydryl-group reagents 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 
and iodoacetamide was only obtained with dithiothreitol-treated LT. Thiol groups 
which are protected as a disulfide bond(s) seem to be essential for the LT 
activity. A specific antiserum against LT neutralized the biological activities 
of LT and also cytotoxic activity and lethal activity of Clostridium difficile 
toxin B but not of C. difficile toxin A. However, this serum did not recognize 
antigen from C. difficile culture supernatant by immunoblotting. It was 
concluded that antibodies prepared from C. sordellii LT that neutralized C. 
difficile cytotoxic activity recognized a low number of epitopes or tertiary 
structures of C. difficile cytotoxin.

Difference in the cytotoxic effects of toxin B from Clostridium difficile strain 
VPI 10463 and toxin B from variant Clostridium difficile strain 1470.

Glucosylation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by Clostridium difficile toxin B from 
strain VPI 10463 (TcdB) results in actin reorganization (cytopathic effect) and 
apoptosis (cytotoxic effect). Toxin B from variant C. difficile strain 1470 
serotype F (TcdBF) differs from TcdB with regard to substrate proteins, as it 
glucosylates Rac1 and R-Ras but not RhoA and Cdc42. In this study, we addressed 
the question of whether the cellular effects of the toxins depend on their 
protein substrate specificity. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were 
synchronized using the thymidine double-block technique. We show that cells were 
most sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of TcdB in S phase, as analyzed in terms 
of phosphatidyl serine externalization, fragmentation of nuclei, and activation 
of caspase-3; in contrast, TcdBF induced only a marginal cytotoxic effect, 
suggesting that inactivation of RhoA (but not of Rac1) was required for the 
cytotoxic effect. The glucosylation of Rac1 was correlated to the cytopathic 
effect of either toxin, suggesting a close connection of the two effects. The 
cytotoxic effect of TcdB was executed by caspase-3, as it was responsive to 
inhibition by acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DMQD-CHO), an inhibitor of 
caspase-3. The viability of TcdB-treated RBL cells was reduced, whereas the 
viability of TcdBF-treated cells was unchanged, further confirming that 
inactivation of RhoA is required for the cytotoxic effect. In conclusion, the 
protein substrate specificity of the glucosylating toxins determines their 
biological activity.

Gastrointestinal (GI) leakage in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea 
(CDAD) is well known but is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. Serum 
(1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), a fungal cell wall component used as a biomarker for 
invasive fungal disease, was tested in a CDAD mouse model with and without 
probiotics. Higher serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) and 
spontaneous gram-negative bacteremia, GI leakage indicators, were frequently 
found in CDAD mice, which died compared with those which survived. BG, serum 
macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and FITC-dextran but not quantitative blood 
bacterial count differentiated the clinical severity. Interestingly, a specific 
dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated CDAD and decreased serum BG and 
FITC-dextran, but not other parameters. BG also showed a higher area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve for 7-day mortality than FITC-dextran. 
Fifty-five percent of CDAD mice with BG ≥ 60 pg/ml (the human negative cut-off 
value for invasive fungal disease) at 1 day after C. difficile gavage died 
within 7 days. In conclusion, S: erum BG was elevated in mice with severe CDAD, 
an established model of GI leakage with a strong association with mortality 
rate. BG monitoring in patients with CDAD is of interest as both a potential 
prognostic tool and a therapeutic efficacy indicator.

Clostridium difficile pathogenicity is related to in vivo production of toxins, 
and it is of great interest to detect toxins produced in biological samples. 
Several reports have shown that proteases in stools interfere with immunological 
methods for quantitation of toxin A. The purpose of this work was to estimate 
the relationship between the proteases and the C. difficile toxins produced in a 
gnotobiotic mouse model of pseudomembranous cecitis. Cecal proteolytic 
activities hydrolyzed toxin A, and immunoglobulin G bound to the microtiter 
plate used in immunoassays. This interference could be blocked by the addition 
of trypsin inhibitor to the samples. The ability of soluble toxin A to bind to 
bound antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was not affected by the 
proteases, but the biological activity was reduced 100-fold. The cytotoxicity of 
toxin B was not modified by proteolytic activity treatment. Mice inoculated with 
a low toxin A-producing strain of C. difficile did not died, and no modulation 
of proteolytic activities occurred. After inoculation with the lethal VPI strain 
of C. difficile, toxins A and B reached maximum levels in the ceca at 12 h 
postinfection. At this time, the proteolytic activities did not decrease from 
the levels seen at zero time. Mice died within 2 days. At this time (about 32 
postinfection), proteolytic activities were sharply decreased in the lower parts 
of the digestive tracts. The findings that serum inhibited the proteases and 
that there was a 100-fold increase in serum-derived mouse immunoglobulins in the 
lumen as the C. difficile infection progressed suggest that the decrease in 
protease activity in the lower digestive tract may be related to the exudation 
of serum from the inflammation process.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the main cause of antibiotic associated 
diarrhea. In the past decade, the number of C. difficile patients has increased 
dramatically, coinciding with the emergence of two PCR ribotypes 027 and 078. 
PCR ribotype 078 is also frequently found during C. difficile outbreaks in 
pigfarms. Previously, the genome of the PCR ribotype 078 strain M120, a human 
isolate, was described to contain a unique insert of 100 kilobases.
RESULTS: Analysis of this insert revealed over 90 open reading frames, encoding 
proteins originating from transposons, phages and plasmids. The insert was shown 
to be a transposon (Tn6164), as evidenced by the presence of an excised and 
circularised molecule, containing the ligated 5'and 3'ends of the insert. 
Transfer of the element could not be shown through filter-mating experiments. 
Whole genome sequencing of PCR ribotype 078 strain 31618, isolated from a 
diarrheic piglet, showed that Tn6164 was not present in this strain. To test the 
prevalence of Tn6164, a collection of 231 Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 
isolates from human (n = 173) and porcine (n = 58) origin was tested for the 
presence of this element by PCR. The transposon was present in 9 human, 
tetracycline resistant isolates, originating from various countries in Europe, 
and none of the pig strains. Nine other strains, also tetracycline resistant 
human isolates, contained half of the transposon, suggesting multiple insertion 
steps yielding the full Tn6164. Other PCR ribotypes (n = 66) were all negative 
for the presence of the transposon. Multi locus variable tandem repeat analysis 
revealed genetic relatedness among transposon containing isolates. Although the 
element contained several potential antibiotic resistance genes, it did not 
yield a readily distinguishable phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Tn6164 is a newly described transposon, occurring sporadically in 
C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 strains. Although no transfer of the element could 
be shown, we hypothesize that the element could serve as a reservoir of 
antibiotic resistance genes for other bacteria. Further research is needed to 
investigate the transfer capabilities of the element and to substantiate the 
possible role of Tn6164 as a source of antibiotic resistance genes for other gut 
pathogens.

Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of infectious antibiotic-associated 
diarrhoea, particularly among the elderly. Its surface-layer protein (SLP) was 
tested as a vaccine component in a series of immunization and challenge 
experiments with Golden Syrian hamsters, combined with different systemic and 
mucosal adjuvants. Some regimens were also tested in a nonchallenge BALB/c mouse 
model, enabling closer monitoring of the immune response. None of the regimens 
conferred complete protection in the hamster model, and antibody stimulation was 
variable within regimens, and generally modest or poor. Mice displayed stronger 
antibody responses to SLP compared with hamsters. Two hamsters of five given SLP 
with Ribi (monophosphoryl lipid A and synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate) 
survived the challenge, as did two of three given SLP with Ribi and cholera 
toxin. This modest trend to protection is interpreted with caution, because the 
survivors had low anti-SLP serum antibody titres. The hamsters were an outbred 
line, and subject to more genetic variability than inbred animals; however, 
BALB/c mice also showed strongly variable antibody responses. There is a clear 
need for better adjuvants for single-component vaccines, particularly for 
mucosal delivery. The hamster challenge model may need to be modified to be 
useful in active immunization experiments with SLP.

[Human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes and their rapid 
detection].

Major human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes include 
botulisms, tetanus, foodborne illness caused by enterotoxin-producing 
Clostridium perfringens, and diarrhea/colitis caused by toxigenic Clostridium 
difficile. Recently, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been 
recognized, that may be related to childhood diarrheal disease. Detection test 
of botulinal neurotoxin is hardly performed at clinical laboratories since the 
most reliable means of detection and identification of botulinal toxin is by 
using mouse toxicity and neutralization tests. Clinical laboratories should 
request the tests to a reference laboratory. Since tetanus is easily diagnosed 
clinically on the basis of its unique, recognizable sings, the bacteriological 
tests is not usually requested. C. perfringens foodborne illness can be 
confirmed by testing stool specimens or the suspect food(s) for enterotoxin by 
the reversed passive latex agglutination test or counting > 10 5 C. perfringens 
per g of suspected food or > 10 6 C. perfringens spores per g of stool. 
Diagnosis of C. difficile-associated diarrhea/colitis is confirmed by detection 
of toxins A or B of C. difficile and/or recovery of toxigenic C. difficile. 
Isolation of C. difficile strains or detection C. difficile-speciffic antigen 
from stool specimens is less diagnostic since nontoxic or toxin A positive-toxin 
B negative strains are prevalent in Japan. Reliable laboratory tests for 
ETBF-associated childhood diarrhea are not established yet although ETBF can be 
proved by polymerase chain reaction for detection of the enterotoxin gene.

Pantothenate, commonly referred to as vitamin B(5), is an essential molecule in 
the metabolism of living organisms and forms the core of coenzyme A. Unlike 
humans, some bacteria and plants are capable of de novo biosynthesis of 
pantothenate, making this pathway a potential target for drug development. 
Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 is a zoonotic bacterial 
pathogen that is able to synthesize pantothenate but is lacking the known 
ketopantoate reductase (KPR) genes, panE and ilvC, found in the canonical 
Escherichia coli pathway. Described herein is a gene encoding a novel KPR, for 
which we propose the name panG (FTT1388), which is conserved in all sequenced 
Francisella species and is the sole KPR in Schu S4. Homologs of this KPR are 
present in other pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Coxiella 
burnetii, and Clostridium difficile. Both the homologous gene from E. faecalis 
V583 (EF1861) and E. coli panE functionally complemented Francisella novicida 
lacking any KPR. Furthermore, panG from F. novicida can complement an E. coli 
KPR double mutant. A Schu S4 ΔpanG strain is a pantothenate auxotroph and was 
genetically and chemically complemented with panG in trans or with the addition 
of pantolactone. There was no virulence defect in the Schu S4 ΔpanG strain 
compared to the wild type in a mouse model of pneumonic tularemia. In summary, 
we characterized the pantothenate pathway in Francisella novicida and F. 
tularensis and identified an unknown and previously uncharacterized KPR that can 
convert 2-dehydropantoate to pantoate, PanG.

Loss of NHE3 alters gut microbiota composition and influences Bacteroides 
thetaiotaomicron growth.

Changes in the intestinal microbiota have been linked to diabetes, obesity, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-associated 
disease. Despite this, it remains unclear how the intestinal environment, set by 
ion transport, affects luminal and mucosa-associated bacterial composition. 
Na(+)/H(+)-exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), a target of C. difficile toxin B, plays 
an integral role in intestinal Na(+) absorption. Thus the NHE3-deficient mouse 
model was chosen to examine the effect of pH and ion composition on bacterial 
growth. We hypothesized that ion transport-induced change in the intestinal 
environment would lead to alteration of the microbiota. Region-specific changes 
in ion composition and pH correlated with region-specific alteration of luminal 
and mucosal-associated bacteria with general decreases in Firmicutes and 
increases in Bacteroidetes members. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. 
thetaiotaomicron) increased in NHE3(-/-) terminal ileum and was examined in 
vitro to determine whether altered Na(+) was sufficient to affect growth. 
Increased in vitro growth of B. thetaiotaomicron occurred in 43 mM Na(+) 
correlating with the NHE3(-/-) mouse terminal ileum [Na(+)]. NHE3(-/-) terminal 
ileum displayed increased fut2 mRNA and fucosylation correlating with B. 
thetaiotaomicron growth. Inoculation of B. thetaiotaomicron in wild-type and 
NHE3(-/-) terminal ileum organoids displayed increased fut2 and fucosylation, 
indicating that B. thetaiotaomicron alone is sufficient for the increased 
fucosylation seen in vivo. These data demonstrate that loss of NHE3 alters the 
intestinal environment, leading to region-specific changes in bacteria, and shed 
light on the growth requirements of some gut microbiota members, which is vital 
for creating better treatments of complex diseases with an altered gut 
microbiota.

The toxicity of Clostridium difficile large clostridial toxin B (TcdB) can be 
reduced by many orders of magnitude by a combination of targeted point 
mutations. However, a TcdB mutant with five point mutations (referred to herein 
as mTcdB) still has residual toxicity that can be detected in cell-based assays 
and in-vivo mouse toxicity assays. This residual toxicity can be effectively 
removed by treatment with formaldehyde in solution. Storage of the 
formaldehyde-treated mTcdB as a liquid can result in reversion over time back to 
the mTcdB level of toxicity, with the rate of reversion dependent on the storage 
temperature. We found that for both the "forward" mTcdB detoxification reaction 
with formaldehyde, and the "reverse" reversion to toxicity reaction, mouse 
toxicity correlated with several biochemical assays including anion exchange 
chromatography retention time and appearance on SDS-PAGE. Maintenance of a low 
concentration of formaldehyde prevents reversion to toxicity in liquid 
formulations. However, when samples with 0.016% (v/v) formaldehyde were 
lyophilized and stored at 37 °C, formaldehyde continued to react with and modify 
the mTcdB in the lyophilized state. Lyophilization alone effectively prevented 
reversion to toxicity for formaldehyde-treated, formaldehyde-removed mTcdB 
samples stored at 37 °C for 6 months. Formaldehyde-treated, formaldehyde-removed 
lyophilized mTcdB showed no evidence of reversion to toxicity, appeared stable 
by several assays, and was immunogenic in mice, even after storage for 6 months 
at 37 °C.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficile is recognized as a frequent cause 
of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. This study was designed to investigate whether 
Clostridium difficile toxin A might induce apoptosis on human hepatoma cell line 
SMMC7721 and African green monkey kidney Vero cells.
METHODS: Highly purified toxin A was obtained by bovine thyroglobulin affinity 
purification followed by ion exchange chromatography on Q sepharose. The 
apoptosis induction of toxin A was examined on SMMC7721 cells with Vero cells as 
a control. Inhibition of proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Morphological 
assessment of apoptosis was performed with fluorescence and electronic 
microscopy. DNA fragmentation was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell 
cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Toxin A (0.293-4.690 mg x L(-1) ) inhibited proliferation of SMMC7721 
and Vero cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Morphological 
changes of typical apoptosis showed that SMMC7721 had a higher percentage of 
apoptosis than Vero cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from SMMC7721 
treated with toxin A for 48 hours revealed a "ladder" pattern.
CONCLUSION: Clostridium difficile toxin A induced apoptosis of SMMC7721 and Vero 
cells. The apoptosis induction on SMMC7721 cells was more effective than that on 
Vero cells.

Clostridium difficile toxin A stimulates macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 
production in rat intestinal epithelial cells.

Neutrophil infiltration of the colonic mucosa is a hallmark of Clostridium 
difficile toxin A-mediated enterocolitis. Macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 
(MIP-2) is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant secreted by rat macrophages and 
epithelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. In this work, we report 
that administration of toxin A into rat ileal loops increased mucosal levels of 
MIP-2 before the onset of fluid secretion and mucosal neutrophil infiltration. 
Administration of rabbit anti-MIP-2 IgG, but not control IgG, reduced toxin 
A-mediated secretion (by 58%), mucosal permeability (by 80%), and 
myeloperoxidase activity (by 85%). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated 
increased MIP-2 expression in intestinal epithelial and lamina propria cells 1 h 
after toxin A administration. Intestinal epithelial cells purified from toxin 
A-exposed ileal loops also showed increased MIP-2 mRNA expression and MIP-2 
protein release that was inhibited by pretreatment of rats with the 
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. These results indicate that C. 
difficile toxin A induces MIP-2 release from intestinal epithelial cells and 
that MIP-2 contributes to neutrophil mucosal influx during toxin A enteritis.

Analysis of latex agglutination test for Clostridium difficile toxin A (D-1) and 
differentiation between C difficile toxins A and B and latex reactive protein.

Borriello SP, Barclay FE, Reed PJ, Welch AR, Brown JD, Burdon DW.

Virulent toxigenic and avirulent non-toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile 
gave a positive result in the latex agglutination test (LAT) for C difficile 
toxin A (D-1). Similar concentrations of latex agglutinating antigen were 
produced by these strains in vivo. Positive reactions were also given by C 
sporogenes, proteolytic C botulinum Types A, B, and A/F, and Bacteroides 
assaccharolyticus. The latex agglutinating antigen was denatured by boiling for 
10 minutes, but not by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes. The reaction was 
abolished by incubation of test material with crude C difficile antitoxin but 
not with other clostridial antitoxins or specific antitoxin to C difficile toxin 
A. The latex agglutinating antigen present in C difficile eluted between 0.39% 
and 0.47% M sodium chloride, and that produced by the other clostridia, between 
0.35% and 0.43% M sodium chloride by fast protein liquid chromatography. The 
latex agglutinating antigen of C difficile was neither cytotoxic nor mouse 
lethal and was distinct from toxin A and toxin B. In the analysis of faecal 
specimens from patients with diarrhoea the latex agglutination test correlated 
better with the presence of C difficile than with toxin B and detected both 
toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. The latex agglutination test should only be 
used in the laboratory as an alternative to culture for C difficile and not as a 
method for the detection of C difficile toxins.

Brewer's yeast and Saccharomyces boulardii both attenuate Clostridium 
difficile-induced colonic secretion in the rat.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-2583, USA.

Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb), a nonpathogenic yeast, has been used to prevent 
recurrences of Clostridium difficile (C.diff) -associated diarrhea. A single 
report suggested that treatment with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), commonly 
called brewer's yeast (BY), facilitates treatment of persistent C.diff 
infection. We conducted this experiment to determine whether C.diff toxin 
A-induced colonic secretion in the rat is blunted by pretreatment with either Sb 
or BY. We employed closed cecal pouches in two groups of five adult male 
Sprague-Dawley rats fed with standard chow for five days prior to the 
experiment, another group whose water was supplemented with 20 x 10(9) 
colony-forming units (CFU) of Sb per day for five days, and another group whose 
water was supplemented with 20 x 10(9) CFU of Sc per day for five days. Cecal 
pouches were infused for 3 hr with one of the following: (1) normal saline alone 
for a control group, or (2) normal saline plus 5 microg of C.diff toxin A (for 
the other control group and for the two experimental groups). Water movement was 
measured by a nonabsorbable marker technique. Sodium movement and permeability 
to mannitol were also measured. Prior to the infusion, cecal contents were 
quantitatively cultured. In the three animals whose ceca were colonized with 
less than 10(6) CFU of either yeast per gram wet cecal content, toxin A-induced 
secretion could not be attenuated. In contrast, animals whose ceca were 
colonized with more than 10(6) CFU of either yeast per gram of wet cecal content 
showed significantly less secretion after toxin A application than those which 
were not fed yeast. S. cerevisiae reduced secretion by half (N = 5, P = 0.039 
for water, 0.044 for sodium) and Sb by 75% (N = 4, P = 0.015 for water, 0.034 
for sodium). Toxin-induced increases in permeability to [3H]mannitol from 
systemic circulation to cecum could not be blunted by either yeast. We conclude 
that rat ceca can be colonized by either organism and that both organisms reduce 
C.diff toxin A-mediated secretion. We speculate that both organisms might have 
benefit in human C.diff-associated enterocolitis. Further studies of their 
mechanisms of action as well as clinical trials for the prevention and treatment 
of human C.diff infections should be pursued.

Urban Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) carry several pathogens transmissible to 
people. However, pathogen prevalence can vary across fine spatial scales (i.e., 
by city block). Using a population genomics approach, we sought to describe rat 
movement patterns across an urban landscape and to evaluate whether these 
patterns align with pathogen distributions. We genotyped 605 rats from a single 
neighborhood in Vancouver, Canada, and used 1,495 genome-wide single nucleotide 
polymorphisms to identify parent-offspring and sibling relationships using 
pedigree analysis. We resolved 1,246 pairs of relatives, of which only 1% of 
pairs were captured in different city blocks. Relatives were primarily caught 
within 33 meters of each other leading to a highly leptokurtic distribution of 
dispersal distances. Using binomial generalized linear mixed models, we 
evaluated whether family relationships influenced rat pathogen status with the 
bacterial pathogens Leptospira interrogans, Bartonella tribocorum, and 
Clostridium difficile, and found that an individual's pathogen status was not 
predicted any better by including disease status of related rats. The spatial 
clustering of related rats and their pathogens lends support to the hypothesis 
that spatially restricted movement promotes the heterogeneous patterns of 
pathogen prevalence evidenced in this population. Our findings also highlight 
the utility of evolutionary tools to understand movement and rat-associated 
health risks in urban landscapes.

Foodborne ingestion through pork products of Clostridium difficile has been 
suggested a possible route of transmission of C difficile from pigs to humans. 
To determine whether C. difficile bacteria are present in the intestines of 
slaughter pigs, rectum contents of 677 slaughter pigs from 52 farms were 
collected at the slaughterhouse. Data on farm specific factors were collected 
and the association of these factors with the presence of C. difficile in pig 
herds from 39 farms was assessed. The prevalence of C. difficile and the 
ribotypical diversity that were found in this study were much higher than 
previously reported in literature, with an overall C. difficile prevalence of 
8.6% (58/677). Sixteen distinct C. difficile ribotypes were identified, 
predominantly type 078 (31.0%, 18/58). This type is also commonly found in 
humans with C. difficile infection (CDI). Both on individual pig level and on 
herd level, no significant difference between the prevalence of C. difficile in 
pigs derived from conventional or organic farming types was detected. Farm 
system, size, and presence of other animal species on the farm did not result in 
significant different prevalences of C. difficile.

Many microRNAs participate in the development, differentiation and function 
preservation of the embryonic and adult inner ear, but many details still need 
to be elucidated regarding the numerous microRNAs in the inner ear. Based on 
previous investigations on the microRNA profile in the inner ear, we confirmed 
that several microRNAs are expressed in the inner ear, and we detected the 
spatial expression of these microRNAs in the neonatal mouse inner ear. Then we 
focused on miR-194 for its specific expression with a dynamic spatiotemporal 
pattern during inner ear development. Overexpression of miR-194 in cultured 
spiral ganglion cells significantly affected the dendrites of differentiated 
neurons, with more branching and obviously dispersed nerve fibres. Furthermore, 
the cytoskeleton of cultured cells was markedly affected, as disordered actin 
filaments resulting from miR-194 overexpression and enhanced filaments resulting 
from miR-194 knockdown were observed. Together with the bioinformatic methods, 
the RT-qPCR and western blot results showed that RhoB is a candidate target of 
miR-194 in the morphogenesis of spiral ganglion neurons. Additionally, the 
double luciferase reporter system was used to identify RhoB as a novel target of 
miR-194. Finally, the inhibition of RhoB activation by Clostridium difficile 
toxin B disturbed the organization of the actin filament, similar to the effects 
of miR-194 overexpression. In summary, we investigated microRNA expression in 
the mouse inner ear, and demonstrated that miR-194 is dynamically expressed 
during inner ear development; importantly, we found that miR-194 affects neuron 
morphogenesis positively through Rho B-mediated F-actin rearrangement.

Clostridium difficile (Cd) toxins appear to mediate the inflammatory response in 
pseudomembranous colitis and/or colitis associated with the use of antibiotics. 
In contrast to Cd Toxin A (TxA), Cd Toxin B (TxB) has been reported not to 
promote fluid secretion or morphological damage in rabbits and hamsters and also 
does not induce neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. However, TxB is about 1000 times 
more potent than TxA in stimulating the release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-alpha) by cultured monocytes. In the present study, we investigated the 
ability of TxB to promote neutrophil migration into peritoneal cavities and 
subcutaneous air-pouches of rats. We also examined the role of resident 
peritoneal cells in this process as well as the inflammatory mediators involved. 
TxB caused a significant and dose-dependent neutrophil influx with a maximal 
response at 0.1 microgram/cavity after 4 hr. Depleting the peritoneal resident 
cell population by washing the peritoneal cavity or increasing this population 
by pretreating the animals with thioglycollate blocked and amplified the 
TxB-induced neutrophil migration, respectively. Pretreating the animals with 
MK886 (a lipoxygenase inhibitor), NDGA (a dual cyclo- and lipoxygenase 
inhibitor) or the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, but not with indomethacin (a 
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor), or BN52021 (a platelet-activating factor 
antagonist), inhibited the neutrophil migration evoked by TxB. Pretreatment with 
dexamethasone or the administration of anti-TNF-alpha serum into the air-pouches 
also significantly reduced the TxB-induced neutrophil migration. Supernatants 
from TxB-stimulated macrophages induced neutrophil migration when injected into 
the rat peritoneal cavity. This effect was attenuated by the addition of either 
MK886 or dexamethasone to the macrophage monolayer and by preincubating the 
supernatants with anti-TNF-alpha serum. TxB also stimulated the release of 
TNF-alpha by macrophages. Overall, these results suggest that TxB induces an 
intense neutrophil migration which is mediated by macrophage-derived TNF-alpha 
and lipoxygenase products.

Differentiation of Clostridium difficile toxin from Clostridium botulinum toxin 
by the mouse lethality test.

Gilligan PH, Brown L, Berman RE.

The mouse lethality test is the most sensitive method for confirming the 
diagnosis of infant botulism. Both Clostridium difficile and Clostridium 
botulinum produce heat-labile toxins which are lethal for mice and can be found 
in the feces of infants. These two toxins can be distinguished from one another 
in this assay when both are present in the same fecal specimen because they 
appear to be immunologically distinct toxins.

Amixicile shows efficacy in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections 
(CDI) in a mouse model, with no recurrence of CDI. Since amixicile selectively 
inhibits the action of a B vitamin (thiamine pyrophosphate) cofactor of 
pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), it may both escape mutation-based 
drug resistance and spare beneficial probiotic gut bacteria that do not express 
this enzyme. Amixicile is a water-soluble derivative of nitazoxanide (NTZ), an 
antiparasitic therapeutic that also shows efficacy against CDI in humans. In 
comparative studies, amixicile showed no toxicity to hepatocytes at 200 μM (NTZ 
was toxic above 10 μM); was not metabolized by human, dog, or rat liver 
microsomes; showed equivalence or superiority to NTZ in cytochrome P450 assays; 
and did not activate efflux pumps (breast cancer resistance protein, P 
glycoprotein). A maximum dose (300 mg/kg) of amixicile given by the oral or 
intraperitoneal route was well tolerated by mice and rats. Plasma exposure 
(rats) based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 79.3 h · 
μg/ml (30 mg/kg dose) to 328 h · μg/ml (100 mg/kg dose), the maximum 
concentration of the drug in serum was 20 μg/ml, the time to the maximum 
concentration of the drug in serum was 0.5 to 1 h, and the half-life was 5.6 h. 
Amixicile did not concentrate in mouse feces or adversely affect gut populations 
of Bacteroides species, Firmicutes, segmented filamentous bacteria, or 
Lactobacillus species. Systemic bioavailability was demonstrated through 
eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a mouse infection model. In summary, the 
efficacy of amixicile in treating CDI and other infections, together with low 
toxicity, an absence of mutation-based drug resistance, and excellent drug 
metabolism and pharmacokinetic metrics, suggests a potential for broad 
application in the treatment of infections caused by PFOR-expressing microbial 
pathogens in addition to CDI.

Ceftobiprole and ceftobiprole medocaril did not promote growth of or toxin 
production by Clostridium difficile in mouse cecal contents, whereas 
ceftazidime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ertapenem did. The 
relatively low propensity of ceftobiprole to promote C. difficile was 
attributable to inhibitory activity against C. difficile and sparing of 
anaerobic microflora.

The capability of a recombinant mucin-like fusion protein, P-selectin 
glycoprotein ligand-1/mouse IgG2b (PSGL-1/mIgG2b), carrying Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc 
determinants to bind and inhibit Clostridium difficile toxin A (TcdA) was 
investigated. The fusion protein, produced by a glyco-engineered stable CHO-K1 
cell line and designated C-PGC2, was purified by affinity and gel filtration 
chromatography from large-scale cultures. Liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to characterize O-glycans released by reductive 
β-elimination, and new diagnostic ions to distinguish Galα1,3Gal- from 
Galα1,4Gal-terminated O-glycans were identified. The C-PGC2 cell line, which was 
20-fold more sensitive to TcdA than the wild-type CHO-K1, is proposed as a novel 
cell-based model for TcdA cytotoxicity and neutralization assays. The 
C-PGC2-produced fusion protein could competitively inhibit TcdA binding to 
rabbit erythrocytes, making it a high-efficiency inhibitor of the 
hemagglutination property of TcdA. The fusion protein also exhibited a moderate 
capability for neutralization of TcdA cytotoxicity in both C-PGC2 and CHO-K1 
cells, the former with and the latter without cell surface Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc 
sequences. Future studies in animal models of C. difficile infection will reveal 
its TcdA-inhibitory effect and therapeutic potential in C. difficile-associated 
diseases.

Isolation of Clostridium difficile from various colonies of laboratory mice.

Itoh K, Lee WK, Kawamura H, Mitsuoka T, Magaribuchi T.

An attempt was made to isolate Clostridium difficile from a total of 565 mice 
from nine different conventional mouse colonies and six different 
specified-pathogen-free mouse colonies. C. difficile was isolated from all the 
conventional colonies but from none of the specified-pathogen-free colonies. 
Ampicillin injected intraperitoneally increased the isolation rate of C. 
difficile from mouse faeces to 63.6% compared with 19.4% from untreated mice.

Fixation of Clostridium difficile toxin A and cholera toxin to intestinal brush 
border membranes from axenic and conventional mice.

Agronomique, Jouy-en-Josas, France.

We have tested the in vitro binding of Clostridium difficile toxin A 
(enterotoxin) and cholera toxin to intestinal brush border membranes prepared 
from either conventional or axenic mice. Membranes from axenic mice were shown 
to be saturated at a lower toxin A concentration (at least 2.5 times lower). 
Because there were no significant differences between membranes from axenic and 
conventional mice in binding at low toxin A concentrations, the presence of the 
normal microflora seems to increase the number but not the affinity of brush 
border membrane receptors on the enterocyte surface. Corroborating the in vitro 
results, we observed that conventional mice were more sensitive to the 
pathological effects of toxin A given intragastrically than were axenic mice. In 
contrast, there was no difference in the binding characteristics of cholera 
toxin between membranes from conventional and axenic mice. We conclude that the 
presence of the mouse intestinal bacteria increases the number of C. difficile 
toxin A intestinal receptors but does not influence cholera toxin receptors.

BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast used for the 
prevention and treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and 
colitis. However, the mechanism by which S. boulardii exerts its protective 
effects remains unclear.
METHODS: The binding of [3H]toxin A to its brush border receptor preincubated 
with S. boulardii-cultured suspension or filtered conditioned medium was 
measured in vitro. The effect of toxin A on secretion, epithelial permeability, 
and morphology in rat ileal loops in vivo was also examined in rats pretreated 
with S. boulardii.
RESULTS: S. boulardii reduced [3H]toxin A-receptor binding in a dose-dependent 
fashion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ileal 
brush border exposed to S. boulardii-conditioned medium revealed a diminution of 
all brush border proteins. Treatment of rats with S. boulardii suspension 
reduced fluid secretion and mannitol permeability caused by toxin A.
CONCLUSIONS: S. boulardii may reduce some of the enterotoxic effects of toxin A 
by inhibiting toxin A-receptor binding. This effect appears to be manifested by 
a secreted product of the yeast, possibly a protease.

Clostridium difficile is a major cause of diarrhoea associated with 
antibiotherapy. Exposed to stresses in the gut, C. difficile can survive by 
inducing protection, detoxification and repair systems. In several firmicutes, 
most of these systems are controlled by the general stress response involving σB 
. In this work, we studied the role of σB in the physiopathology of C. 
difficile. We showed that the survival of the sigB mutant during the stationary 
phase was reduced. Using a transcriptome analysis, we showed that σB controls 
the expression of ∼25% of genes including genes involved in sporulation, 
metabolism, cell surface biogenesis and the management of stresses. By contrast, 
σB does not control toxin gene expression. In agreement with the up-regulation 
of sporulation genes, the sporulation efficiency is higher in the sigB mutant 
than in the wild-type strain. sigB inactivation also led to increased 
sensitivity to acidification, cationic antimicrobial peptides, nitric oxide and 
ROS. In addition, we showed for the first time that σB also plays a crucial role 
in oxygen tolerance in this strict anaerobe. Finally, we demonstrated that the 
fitness of colonisation by the sigB mutant is greatly affected in a dixenic 
mouse model of colonisation when compared to the wild-type strain.

The gastrointestinal tract of dogs, cats, and other mammals including humans 
harbors millions of beneficial microorganisms that regulate and maintain health. 
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving the 
administration of a fecal infusion from a healthy individual (donor) to a 
patient with disease to help improve health. Despite the effectiveness of FMT to 
treat intestinal disorders in humans, in particular recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infection, there is a paucity of scientific data regarding the 
application of FMT in veterinary patients. Here, we outline key aspects of FMT 
in small animal practice.

We investigated the increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 
caused by the combined use of antibiotics and an immunosuppressive drug in a 
mouse model. Our data showed that an approximate return to pretreatment 
conditions of gut microbiota occurred within days after cessation of the 
antibiotic treatment, whereas the recovery of gut microbiota was delayed with 
the combined treatment of antibiotics and dexamethasone, leading to an increased 
severity of CDI. An alteration of gut microbiota is a key player in CDI. 
Therefore, our data implied that immunosuppressive drugs can increase the risk 
of CDI through the delayed recovery of altered gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Activation of intestinal mast cells and neurons is involved in 
intestinal inflammation and diarrhea. This study compared the effects of 
neuronal inhibitors and inhibition of intestinal sensory afferent nerves on the 
intestinal actions of Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory 
enterotoxin, and cholera toxin, a noninflammatory enterotoxin.
METHODS: The effects of lidocaine, hexamethonium, atropine, and long-term 
pretreatment of capsaicin on fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and release of rat mast cell protease II 
(RMCPII) were measured in toxin A- and cholera toxin-exposed loops in vivo.
RESULTS: Lidocaine, hexamethonium, and capsaicin, but not atropine, inhibited 
toxin A-mediated secretion and MPO activity, but only capsaicin reduced mannitol 
permeability. Lidocaine, but not capsaicin, reduced secretion and permeability 
caused by cholera toxin. Toxin A caused release of RMCPII from rat ileum in vivo 
and in vitro; this was inhibited by lidocaine or capsaicin, whereas cholera 
toxin had no effect on release of RMCPII.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal mechanisms are important in the in vivo effects of these 
two enterotoxins. Capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferent neurons and mast cells 
are involved in the intestinal mechanism of toxin A, but not cholera toxin.

toxins A and B in human colonic mucosa.

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast used in the treatment of 
Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis. We have reported that S. boulardii 
inhibits C. difficile toxin A enteritis in rats by releasing a 54-kDa protease 
which digests the toxin A molecule and its brush border membrane (BBM) receptor 
(I. Castagliuolo, J. T. LaMont, S. T. Nikulasson, and C. Pothoulakis, Infect. 
Immun. 64:5225-5232, 1996). The aim of this study was to further evaluate the 
role of S. boulardii protease in preventing C. difficile toxin A enteritis in 
rat ileum and determine whether it protects human colonic mucosa from C. 
difficile toxins. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against purified S. 
boulardii serine protease inhibited by 73% the proteolytic activity present in 
S. boulardii conditioned medium in vitro. The anti-protease immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) prevented the action of S. boulardii on toxin A-induced intestinal 
secretion and mucosal permeability to [3H]mannitol in rat ileal loops, while 
control rabbit IgG had no effect. The anti-protease IgG also prevented the 
effects of S. boulardii protease on digestion of toxins A and B and on binding 
of [3H]toxin A and [3H]toxin B to purified human colonic BBM. Purified S. 
boulardii protease reversed toxin A- and toxin B-induced inhibition of protein 
synthesis in human colonic (HT-29) cells. Furthermore, toxin A- and B-induced 
drops in transepithelial resistance in human colonic mucosa mounted in Ussing 
chambers were reversed by 60 and 68%, respectively, by preexposing the toxins to 
S. boulardii protease. We conclude that the protective effects of S. boulardii 
on C. difficile-induced inflammatory diarrhea in humans are due, at least in 
part, to proteolytic digestion of toxin A and B molecules by a secreted 
protease.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial 
swine herds, previously regarded to be uncomplicated to treat. However, since 
2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to 
antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory 
examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The 
primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens 
could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the 
hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and 
microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a 
preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine 
Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS).
RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no 
previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New 
Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 
diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were 
necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces 
were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens 
type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, 
Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with 
diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets 
were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal 
changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum 
and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case 
piglets.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new 
neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known 
pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based 
on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was 
suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without 
detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs 
and flaccid intestines at necropsy.

Clostridium difficile toxin A causes acute colitis associated with intense 
infiltration of neutrophils. Although C. difficile toxin A is known to induce 
nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated chemokine expression in intestinal epithelial 
cells, little is known about its effect on the regulation of activator protein-1 
(AP-1) by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In the present study, we 
investigated whether the MAPK and AP-1 signaling pathway is involved in 
interleukin (IL)-8 expression and enteric inflammation in response to 
stimulation with toxin A. Toxin A activated MAPK and AP-1 composed of 
c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers in primary intestinal epithelial cells and HT-29 cell 
lines. Transfection with mutant genes for Ras, c-Jun, p38, or c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) significantly inhibited C. difficile toxin A-induced activation of 
AP-1 and expression of IL-8 in HT-29 cell lines. Furthermore, the p38 inhibitor 
SB203580 attenuated toxin A-induced inflammation in vivo in the mouse ileum, 
evidenced by a significant decrease in neutrophil infiltration, villous 
destruction, and mucosal congestion. Our results suggest that the Ras/MAPK 
cascade acts as the upstream signaling for AP-1 activation and IL-8 expression 
in toxin A-stimulated intestinal epithelial cells and may be involved in the 
development of enteritis after infection with toxin A-producing C. difficile.

We earlier showed that lovastatin potentiated the chemopreventive effects of 
sulindac against colon neoplasia in a rodent model and augments apoptosis 
induced by 5-FU and cisplatin in human colon cancer cells. In the present study, 
we investigated effects of lovastatin in spontaneously immortalized rat 
intestinal epithelial cells, IEC-18 and their K-ras transformed clones. 
Lovastatin induced morphologic changes (cell rounding and detachment) and 
apoptosis that were not influenced by K-ras mutations, but were prevented by 
geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate or by mevalonate. Clostridium difficile toxin B, 
which directly inactivates rho, induced similar morphologic changes and 
apoptosis. Cycloheximide prevented these effects of lovastatin, but not C. 
difficile toxin B. Lovastatin decreased the amounts of membrane bound rhoA and 
rhoB. Cycloheximide and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate prevented lovastatin 
induced morphologic changes and apoptosis but did not inhibit lovastatin-induced 
changes in membrane translocation of rho. Our data suggest that lovastatin 
induces morphologic changes and apoptosis by inhibiting geranylgeranylation of 
small GTPases of the rho family and thereby inactivating them. Restoration of 
membrane translocation of rho is not necessary for preventing lovastatin-induced 
morphologic changes or apoptosis.

Among several small Rho GTPases observed in the chick retina, RhoB was 
transiently expressed during development and mainly present in glial Müller 
cells in the adult. The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of 
RhoB in the chick and mouse adult retinas and to study its potential role in the 
maintenance of cell morphology. The distribution of RhoB was studied in situ and 
pure Müller cell cultures were submitted to Clostridium difficile toxin A and 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) treatment in order to inactivate and activate Rho 
proteins, respectively. Cell morphology, F-actin arrangement, RhoB, and vimentin 
distribution were studied by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The 
results showed that, in both species, all vimentin-containing cells also 
expressed RhoB in situ and in vitro. Toxin A promoted cell rounding and 
detachment due to actin depolymerization, changing the distribution of RhoB only 
in chick cells. In serum-starved cells LPA stimulated actin polymerization and 
cell spreading, but only in chick cells was RhoB distribution recruited to 
expanding cellular processes and newly formed focal adhesions. These data 
suggest that, although RhoB is expressed by Müller cells in chick and mouse, its 
role in the maintenance of cellular morphology and regulation may be different. 
In addition, we show that RhoB may be an interesting Müller cell marker in the 
adult retina.

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection has increased in Western world 
in the past 10 years, similar infection rates are also reported in developing 
countries such as China. Current antibiotics treatments have recurrence rates 
between 15% and 30%. IgY antibodies against toxin A of C. difficile could 
protect animal models from the challenge of lethal dose of C. difficile spores. 
However, IgY is sensitive to the low pH environment of the stomach and 
proteinases in the intestine. The objective of this study was to prepare 
colonic-specific delivery system of toxin A antigen-specific IgY to block the 
recognition of toxin A to the colon mucosa cells. Egg-laying hens were immunized 
with purified C. difficile toxin A C-terminal domain for 3 times, then egg IgY 
against the recombinant ToxA-C protein was purified from immunized egg yolk and 
frozen dried. IgY-loaded microbeads were prepared using mini fluid bed system; 
the loading efficiency was 21%. The pH and temperature stabilities of the 
microbeads were assayed. The IgY-loaded microbeads coated with 35% Eudragit S100 
had colonic-specific IgY release specificity both in vitro and in vivo, the 
colonic-specific release of biological active IgY was 87.5% in the rat. Our 
study provides a new option for the biological treatment C. difficile infection.

Large amounts of antibiotics are currently used in livestock breeding, which is 
the main driving factor contributing to the occurrence, spread and proliferation 
of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 
the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing based metagenomic 
approaches were employed to characterize the tempo-spacial changes of antibiotic 
resistome, bacterial community and their correlations in pig farming wastewater 
and its receiving river. A total of 194 ARG subtypes within 14 ARG types were 
detectable in all the samples, and their total relative abundance increased in 
the river water after receiving wastewater discharge, while decreased in the 
downstream river water. Network analysis showed that 25.26% ARGs within the same 
type or among the different types showed higher incidences of non-random 
co-occurrence. The wastewater discharge evidently increased bacterial diversity 
and induced bacterial community shift in the receiving river water. The genera 
of Treponema, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Oscillibacter and 
Acholeplasma dominated in the wastewater samples and almost disappeared in the 
receiving river water, but bacterial pathogens Clostridium difficile and 
Arcobacter butzleri still occurred in the receiving water. Correlation analysis 
and host analysis consistently showed that the changes in the abundances of 
several key genera like Prevotella and Treponema were significantly and 
positively correlated with the antibiotic resistome alteration. Variation 
partitioning analysis indicated that bacterial community played a more important 
role in the resistome alteration than mobile genetic elements. This study may 
help to understand the correlations among antibiotic resistome, microbiota and 
environmental conditions in the wastewater-receiving river water.

We examined the role of glucocorticoids in acute inflammatory diarrhea mediated 
by Clostridium difficile toxin A. Toxin A (5 microg) or buffer was injected in 
rat ileal loops, and intestinal responses were measured after 30 min to 4 h. 
Ileal toxin A administration increased plasma glucocorticoids after 1 h, at 
which time the toxin-stimulated secretion was not significant. Administration of 
the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone inhibited toxin A-induced intestinal 
secretion and inflammation and downregulated toxin A-mediated increase of 
macrophage inflammatory protein-2. Adrenalectomy followed by replacement with 
glucocorticoids at various doses suggested that intestinal responses to toxin A 
were related to circulating levels of glucocorticoids. Administration of the 
glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 enhanced toxin A-mediated intestinal 
secretion and inflammation. We conclude that C. difficile toxin A causes 
increased secretion of endogenous glucocorticoids, which diminish the intestinal 
secretory and inflammatory effects of toxin A.

Clostridium difficile toxin A causes acute colitis associated with inflammatory 
cell infiltration and increased production of proinflammatory mediators. 
Although CX3CL1 (fractalkine) plays a role in chemoattracting 
monocytes/macrophages, NK cells, and T cells, little information is available on 
the regulated expression of CX3CL1 in response to toxin A stimulation. In this 
study, we investigated the role of C. difficile toxin A on CX3CL1 induction in 
intestinal epithelial cells. Stimulation of murine intestinal epithelial cells 
with toxin A resulted in the upregulation of CX3CL1. Expression of CX3CL1 was 
dependent on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and IκB kinase (IKK) activation, 
while the suppression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) did not affect toxin 
A-induced CX3CL1 expression. Suppression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) significantly inhibited IKK-NF-κB signaling leading to CX3CL1 induction 
in C. difficile toxin A-stimulated cells. CX3CL1 was mainly secreted from the 
basolateral surfaces in toxin A-treated cells. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 
activity attenuated the toxin A-induced upregulation of CX3CL1 in the mouse 
ileum in vivo. These results suggest that a pathway, including p38 MAPK, IKK, 
and NF-κB activation, is required for CX3CL1 induction in intestinal epithelial 
cells exposed to C. difficile toxin A and may regulate the development of 
intestinal inflammation induced by infection with toxigenic C. difficile.
KEY MESSAGE: C. difficile toxin A causes colitis with inflammatory cell 
infiltration. CX3CL1 plays a role in chemoattracting immune cells. MAPK-NF-κB 
signaling is required for CX3CL1 induction in toxin A-exposed cells. CX3CL1 is 
mainly secreted from the basolateral surfaces. CX3CL1 may contribute to the 
regulation of toxigenic C. difficile infection.

Clostridium difficile toxin A causes acute neutrophil infiltration and 
intestinal mucosal injury. In cultured cells, toxin A inactivates Rho proteins 
by monoglucosylation. In monocytes, toxin A induces IL-8 production and necrosis 
by unknown mechanisms. We investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein 
(MAP) kinases in these events. In THP-1 monocytic cells, toxin A activated the 3 
main MAP kinase cascades within 1 to 2 minutes. Activation of p38 was sustained, 
whereas stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun 
NH(2)-terminal kinase was transient. Rho glucosylation became evident after 15 
minutes. IL-8 gene expression was reduced by 70% by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 
and abrogated by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or by overexpression of 
dominant-negative mutants of the p38-activating kinases MKK3 and MKK6. SB203580 
also blocked monocyte necrosis and IL-1beta release caused by toxin A but not by 
other toxins. Finally, in mouse ileum, SB203580 prevented toxin A-induced 
neutrophil recruitment by 92% and villous destruction by 90%. Thus, in monocytes 
exposed to toxin A, MAP kinase activation appears to precede Rho glucosylation 
and is required for IL-8 transcription and cell necrosis. p38 MAP kinase also 
mediates intestinal inflammation and mucosal damage induced by toxin A.

Clostridium difficile was incriminated by Hughes and Jarvis (1987) as a cause of 
intestinal infections in USA in the 1980-1984 period in 45 p. 100 of cases, 
whereas Salmonellae only in 12 p. 100. Four strains of this organism are studied 
in this paper in comparison with ten strains of C. bifermentans and six of C. 
sordellii, because the three species share a common antigen and have other 
common characteristics, as well. However, spores of C. difficile swell the 
bacteria and those of other bacteria (C. bifermentans and C. sordellii) do not; 
C. difficile does not produce indole, whereas the other species produce it. We 
confirmed the selective capacity of the medium of George et al. (1979) using the 
"alcohol shock" and as selective agents cycloserine D and cefoxitin. C. 
difficile proved to be most susceptible to metronidazole and rifampin. Whereas 
the former antibiotic was considered as a cause of post-antibiotic intestinal 
infections by different authors, the second was not, to our knowledge. The 
strain 10463 has a considerable toxicity (1000 DLM/ml for the white mouse, and 
pathogenicity--2000--5000 DCL for the white mouse, as compared to 25 DCL of the 
other three strains). Using this toxin an antitoxic serum was obtained in horse, 
with a capacity of neutralizing the action of the toxin up to a dilution of 1 p. 
1000.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a serious diarrheal disease that often 
develops following prior antibiotic usage. One of the major problems with 
current therapies (oral vancomycin and metronidazole) is the high rate of 
recurrence. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), an inhibitor of pyruvate:ferredoxin 
oxidoreductase (PFOR) in anaerobic bacteria, parasites, Helicobacter pylori, and 
Campylobacter jejuni, also shows clinical efficacy against CDI. From a library 
of ∼250 analogues of NTZ, we identified leads with increased potency for PFOR. 
MIC screens indicated in vitro activity in the 0.05- to 2-μg/ml range against C. 
difficile. To improve solubility, we replaced the 2-acetoxy group with 
propylamine, producing amixicile, a soluble (10 mg/ml), nontoxic (cell-based 
assay) lead that produced no adverse effects in mice by oral or intraperitoneal 
(i.p.) routes at 200 mg/kg of body weight/day. In initial efficacy testing in 
mice treated (20 mg/kg/day, 5 days each) 1 day after receiving a lethal inoculum 
of C. difficile, amixicile showed slightly less protection than did vancomycin 
by day 5. However, in an optimized CDI model, amixicile showed equivalence to 
vancomycin and fidaxomicin at day 5 and there was significantly greater survival 
produced by amixicile than by the other drugs on day 12. All three drugs were 
comparable by measures of weight loss/gain and severity of disease. Recurrence 
of CDI was common for mice treated with vancomycin or fidaxomicin but not for 
mice receiving amixicile or NTZ. These results suggest that gut repopulation 
with beneficial (non-PFOR) bacteria, considered essential for protection against 
CDI, rebounds much sooner with amixicile therapy than with vancomycin or 
fidaxomicin. If the mouse model is indeed predictive of human CDI disease, then 
amixicile, a novel PFOR inhibitor, appears to be a very promising new candidate 
for treatment of CDI.

The neuropeptide neurotensin mediates several intestinal functions, including 
chloride secretion, motility, and cellular growth. However, whether this peptide 
participates in intestinal inflammation is not known. Toxin A, an enterotoxin 
from Clostridium difficile, mediates pseudomembranous colitis in humans. In 
animal models, toxin A causes an acute inflammatory response characterized by 
activation of sensory neurons and intestinal nerves and immune cells of the 
lamina propria. Here we show that neurotensin and its receptor are elevated in 
the rat colonic mucosa following toxin A administration. Pretreatment of rats 
with the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR-48, 692 inhibits toxin A-induced 
changes in colonic secretion, mucosal permeability, and histologic damage. 
Exposure of colonic explants to toxin A or neurotensin causes mast cell 
degranulation, which is inhibited by SR-48,692. Because substance P was 
previously shown to mediate mast cell activation, we examined whether substance 
P is involved in neurotensin-induced mast cell degranulation. Our results show 
that neurotensin-induced mast cell degranulation in colonic explants is 
inhibited by the substance P (neurokinin-1) receptor antagonist CP-96,345, 
indicating that colonic mast activation in response to neurotensin involves 
release of substance P. We conclude that neurotensin plays a key role in the 
pathogenesis of C. difficile-induced colonic inflammation and mast cell 
activation.

The gastrointestinal environment is a complex interactive system involving the 
host, ingested dietary components, and numerous microbial species. We 
hypothesized that isolation and screening of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria 
adherent to healthy canine gastrointestinal tissue would yield strains with 
commensal activity in canines. The aims of this study were (1) to isolate a bank 
of commensal organisms from the canine gastrointestinal tract; (2) to screen 
these novel microbial isolates for potential probiotic effects; (3) to select 
one organism from these screens and test its impact on the canine microbiota. 
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from resected canine gastrointestinal 
tissue and screened in vitro for putative probiotic activities. Murine studies 
examined gastrointestinal transit and inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium 
translocation. One strain was progressed to a canine study where its impact on 
the gastrointestinal microbiota was determined. Of the 420 isolates from the 
canine gut, 62 strains were characterised as LAB. Following assessment of the 
strain bank with regard to pH sensitivity, bile resistance, pathogen inhibition 
and survival following freeze-drying, four Lactobacillus strains and two 
Bifidobacteria strains were selected for further examination. Bifidobacterium 
animalis AHC7 adhered to epithelial cells, transited the murine gastrointestinal 
tract to high numbers and significantly reduced S. typhimurium translocation. B. 
animalis AHC7 consumption significantly reduced the carriage of Clostridia, in 
particular Clostridium difficile, in dogs. This study describes the isolation 
and screening of canine-derived bacterial strains with commensal traits. The 
results demonstrate that B. animalis AHC7 has significant potential for 
improving canine gastrointestinal health.

The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared 
with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin 
and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although 
AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group 
and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains 
tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly 
active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium 
spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An 
in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible 
B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. 
AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective 
only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels 
of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was 
found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 
days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the 
clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic 
bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated 
further.

The human gastrointestinal tract is home to hundreds of species of bacteria and 
the balance between beneficial and pathogenic bacteria plays a critical role in 
human health and disease. The human infant, however, is born with a sterile gut 
and the complex gastrointestinal host/bacterial ecosystem is only established 
after birth by rapid bacterial colonization. Composition of newborn gut flora 
depends on several factors including type of birth (Ceasarian or natural), 
manner of early feeding (breast milk or formula), and exposure to local, 
physical environment. Imbalance in normal, healthy gut flora contributes to 
several adult human diseases including inflammatory bowel (ulcerative colitis 
and Crohn's disease) and Clostridium difficile associated disease, and early 
childhood diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis. As a first step towards 
characterization of the role of gut bacteria in human health and disease, we 
conducted an 850 MHz (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study to 
monitor changes in metabolic profiles of urine and fecal extracts of 15 mice 
following gut sterilization by the broad-spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin (also 
known as Baytril). Ten metabolites changed in urine following enrofloxacin 
treatment including decreased acetate due to loss of microbial catabolism of 
sugars and polysaccharides, decreased trimethylamine-N-oxide due to loss of 
microbial catabolism of choline, and increased creatine and creatinine due to 
loss of microbial enzyme degradation. Eight metabolites changed in fecal 
extracts of mice treated with enrofloxacin including depletion of amino acids 
produced by microbial proteases, reduction in metabolites generated by 
lactate-utilizing bacteria, and increased urea caused by loss of microbial 
ureases.

Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb), a probiotic yeast, protects against intestinal 
injury and inflammation caused by a wide variety of enteric pathogens, including 
Clostridium difficile. Given the broad range of protective effects of Sb in 
multiple gastrointestinal disorders, we hypothesize that Sb modulates host 
signaling pathways involved in intestinal inflammatory responses. In this study, 
we found that Sb culture supernatant (SbS) inhibits interleukin-8 production 
induced by C. difficile toxin A or IL-1beta in human colonocyte NCM460 cells in 
a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, SbS inhibited IL-1beta and toxin A 
induced Erk1/2 and JNK/SAPK but not p38 activation in NCM460 cells. To test 
whether this inhibition also occurs in vivo, we used a previously established 
mouse ileal loop model. On its own, SbS had no significant effect on basal fluid 
secretion or intestinal histology. However, Erk1/2 activation was significantly 
inhibited by SbS in toxin A exposed mouse ileal mucosa. In control loops, toxin 
A increased fluid secretion (2.2-fold), histological score (3.3-fold), and 
levels of the chemokine KC (4.5-fold). SbS pretreatment completely normalized 
toxin A mediated fluid secretion (p < 0.01), and histopathologic changes (p < 
0.01) and substantially inhibited toxin A-associated KC increases (p < 0.001). 
In summary, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii inhibits C. difficile toxin 
A-associated enteritis by blocking the activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases. This 
study indicates a new mechanism whereby Sb protects against intestinal 
inflammation and supports the hypothesis that Sb modulates host inflammatory 
signaling pathways to exert its beneficial effects.

FcepsilonRI signaling in rat basophilic leukemia cells depends on 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and the small GTPase Rac. Here, we 
studied the functional relationship among PI3-kinase, its effector protein 
kinase B (PKB), and Rac using inhibitors of PI3-kinase and toxins inhibiting 
Rac. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, blocked FcepsilonRI-mediated 
tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma, inositol phosphate formation, 
calcium mobilization, and secretion of hexosaminidase. Similarly, Clostridium 
difficile toxin B, which inactivates all Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac and 
Cdc42, and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which inhibits Rac (possibly 
Cdc42) but not Rho, blocked these responses. Stimulation of the FcepsilonRI 
receptor induced a rapid increase in the GTP-bound form of Rac. Whereas toxin B 
inhibited the Rac activation, PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) 
had no effect on activation of Rac. In line with this, wortmannin had no effect 
on tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav. 
Wortmannin, toxin B, and lethal toxin inhibited phosphorylation of PKB on 
Ser(473). Similarly, translocation of the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB 
tagged with the green fluorescent protein to the membrane, which was induced by 
activation of the FcepsilonRI receptor, was blocked by inhibitors of PI3-kinase 
and Rac inactivation. Our results indicate that in rat basophilic leukemia cells 
Rac and PI3-kinase regulate PKB and suggest that Rac is functionally located 
upstream and/or parallel of PI3-kinase/PKB in FcepsilonRI signaling.

The global prevalence of severe Clostridium difficile infection highlights the 
profound clinical significance of clostridial glucosylating toxins. Virulence is 
dependent on the autoactivation of a toxin cysteine protease, which is promoted 
by the allosteric cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). Host mechanisms 
that protect against such exotoxins are poorly understood. It is increasingly 
appreciated that the pleiotropic functions attributed to nitric oxide (NO), 
including host immunity, are in large part mediated by S-nitrosylation of 
proteins. Here we show that C. difficile toxins are S-nitrosylated by the 
infected host and that S-nitrosylation attenuates virulence by inhibiting toxin 
self-cleavage and cell entry. Notably, InsP(6)- and inositol pyrophosphate 
(InsP(7))-induced conformational changes in the toxin enabled host 
S-nitrosothiols to transnitrosylate the toxin catalytic cysteine, which forms 
part of a structurally conserved nitrosylation motif. Moreover, treatment with 
exogenous InsP(6) enhanced the therapeutic actions of oral S-nitrosothiols in 
mouse models of C. difficile infection. Allostery in bacterial proteins has thus 
been successfully exploited in the evolutionary development of 
nitrosothiol-based innate immunity and may provide an avenue to new therapeutic 
approaches.

The adverse impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota has attracted extensive 
interest, particularly due to the development of microbiome research techniques 
in recent years. However, a direct comparison of the dynamic effects of various 
types of antibiotics using the same animal model has not been available. In the 
present study, we selected six antibiotics from four categories with the 
broadest clinical usage, namely, β-lactams (Ceftriaxone Sodium, 
Cefoperazone/Sulbactam and meropenem), quinolones (ofloxacin), glycopeptides 
(vancomycin), and macrolides (azithromycin), to treat BALB/c mice. Stool samples 
were collected during and after the administration of antibiotics, and microbial 
diversity was analyzed through Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analyses 
using QIIME. Both α and β diversity analyses showed that ceftriaxone sodium, 
cefoperazone/sulbactam, meropenem and vancomycin changed the gut microbiota 
dramatically by the second day of antibiotic administration whereas the 
influence of ofloxacin was trivial. Azithromycin clearly changed the gut 
microbiota but much less than vancomycin and the β-lactams. In general, the 
community changes induced by the three β-lactam antibiotics showed consistency 
in inhibiting Papillibacter, Prevotella and Alistipes while inducing massive 
growth of Clostridium. The low diversity and high Clostridium level might be an 
important cause of Clostridium difficile infection after usage of β-lactams. 
Vancomycin was unique in that it inhibited Firmicutes, mainly the genus 
Clostridium. On the other hand, it induced the growth of Escherichia and effect 
lasted for months afterward. Azithromycin and meropenem induced the growth of 
Enterococcus. These findings will be useful for understanding the potential 
adverse effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and ensuring their better 
usage.

The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections is highly dynamic as new 
strains continue to emerge worldwide. Here we present a detailed analysis of a 
new C. difficile strain (ICC-45) recovered from a cancer patient in Brazil that 
died from severe diarrhea. A polyphasic approach assigned a new PCR-ribotype and 
PFGE macrorestriction pattern to strain ICC-45, which is toxigenic (tcdA(+), 
tcdB(+) and ctdB(+)) and classified as ST41 from MLST Clade 2 and toxinotype 
IXb. Strain ICC-45 encodes for a variant TcdB that induces a distinct CPE in 
agreement with its toxinotype. Unlike epidemic NAP1/027 strains, which are also 
classified to MLST Clade 2, strain ICC-45 is susceptible to fluoroquinolones and 
does not overproduce toxins TcdA and TcdB. However, supernatants from strain 
ICC-45 and a NAP1/027 strain produced similar expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, epithelial damage, and oxidative stress response in the mouse ileal 
loop model. These results highlight inflammation and oxidative stress as common 
features in the pathogenesis of C. difficile Clade 2 strains. Finally, this work 
contributes to the description of differences in virulence among various 
C. difficile strains.

Immunological studies in ulcerative colitis. IV. Origin of autoantibodies.

Lagercrantz R, Hammarström S, Perlmann P, Gustafsson BE.

The incidence and height of antibody titers to colon, assayed by indirect 
hemagglutination with a heat stable colon extract from germ free rats, is 
significantly higher in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis than in those 
from healthy controls or from patients with amebic liver abscess or dysentery. 
While sera from ulcerative colitis patients and controls are indistinguishable 
in regard to incidence and height of antibody titers to Forsman antigen, 
Staphylococcus aureus S 209, Clostridium difficile, and several common strains 
of E. coli, they have elevated titers and increased incidence of antibodies to a 
heat stable antigen of E. coli O14. Patients with amebic dysentery have normal 
titers of such antibodies. Absorption of patients' sera with E. coli O14 antigen 
inhibits the colon directed hemagglutination reaction in approximately 30% of 
the cases tested. Likewise, the anti-E. coli O14 reaction can sometimes be 
inhibited with the colon extract. Other E. coli strains and other bacteria are 
inactive or have only weak inhibitory activity. Hemagglutination inhibition 
experiments show that germ free rat colon and E. coli O14 contain common 
structures, depicted by antibodies in the patients' sera. This pattern of 
reactivity closely resembles that seen in rats made autoimmune to colon by 
injection of newborn rabbit colon. E. coli O14 is known to carry a heterogenetic 
antigen present in lower concentration (or activity) in most Enterobacteriaceae. 
Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with rabbit antisera to E. coli O14 
suggest that the antigen common for E. coli O14 and colon is related to this 
heterogenetic antigen. The findings imply that this antigen, which is constantly 
present in low concentrations in the human colon, may give rise to anticolon 
antibody formation in ulcerative colitis through breakage of tolerance. Since 
this antigen is present in healthy individuals as well, additional factors are 
required to explain the induction of anti-colon autoimmunity in ulcerative 
colitis.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major threat to human health and is predicted 
to become the leading cause of death from disease by 2050. Despite the recent 
resurgence of research and development in the area, few antibiotics have reached 
the market, with most of the recently approved antibiotics corresponding to new 
uses for old antibiotics, or structurally similar derivatives thereof. We have 
recently reported an in silico approach that led to the design of an entirely 
new class of antibiotics for the bacteria-specific mechanosensitive ion channel 
of large conductance: MscL. Here, we present the preclinical development of one 
such antibiotic, Ramizol, a first generation antibiotic belonging to that class. 
We present the lack of interaction between Ramizol and other mammalian channels 
adding credibility to its MscL selectivity. We determine the pharmacokinetic 
profile in a rat model and show <0.1% of Ramizol is absorbed systemically. We 
show this non-systemic nature of the antibiotic translates to over 70% survival 
of hamsters in a Clostridium difficile colitis model. Lastly, initial in vitro 
data indicate that resistance to Ramizol occurs at a low frequency. In 
conclusion, we establish the potential of Ramizol as an effective new treatment 
for C. difficile associated disease.

Morphologic and functional effects of Clostridium difficile enterotoxin in 
tissue culture.

Gurwith MJ, Langston C, Dunsmore B.

The effects of the Clostridium difficile toxin were examined in HeLa and mouse 
adrenal tumor (MAT) cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by vital dye exclusion and 
51Cr release. In both HeLa and MAT cells, C. difficile toxin caused rounding of 
virtually 100% of cells. This rounding was distinguishable from rounding 
produced by the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT): (1) LT was 
inactive in HeLa cells; (2) in MAT cells, C. difficile toxin produced uniformly 
rounded cells, while LT-rounded cells usually had cytoplasmic extensions and a 
regular background of flattened cells. In C. difficile toxin affected HeLa 
cells, there were less than mitotic figures per 1000 cells compared with 15-18 
in controls. Clostridium difficile toxin treated HeLa cells showed less than 10% 
cytotoxicity in 24 h and no more than 30% by 74 h, similar to control cells. 
However, paralleling the suppression of mitotic figures, cell multiplication was 
inhibited in C. difficile toxin treated cells when subcultured in a short-term 
(72 h) assay compared with up to a 500% increase in control cells. This 
inhibition was also seen in a 6-week cloning assay in which C. difficile toxin 
treated cells had a cloning efficiency of less than 1% compared with 
approximately 10% in controls. We conclude that the major effect of the C. 
difficile toxin is inhibition of growth rather than immediate cell death. The 
relationship of this growth inhibition to colitis remains to be elucidated.

The role of leukotriene B4 in Clostridium difficile toxin A-induced ileitis in 
rats.

McVey DC(1), Vigna SR.

Author information:
(1)Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North 
Carolina, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile toxin A is a potent intestinal 
inflammatory agent that has been shown to act at least partially by neurogenic 
mechanisms involving activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 
(TRPV1) (capsaicin) receptor. We tested the hypothesis that leukotriene B4 
(LTB4) mediates the effects of toxin A via activation of the TRPV1 receptor.
METHODS: Isolated rat ileal segments were pretreated with pharmacologic agents 
before intraluminal injection of toxin A or LTB4. After 3 hours, the treated 
segments were removed and inflammation was assessed by luminal fluid 
accumulation, myeloperoxidase activity, and histology.
RESULTS: LTB4 caused ileitis similar to that caused by toxin A and antagonism of 
TRPV1 receptors but not LTB4 receptors inhibited LTB4-induced inflammation. LTB4 
also stimulated TRPV1-mediated substance P release and pretreatment with a 
specific substance P-receptor antagonist blocked LTB4-induced substance P action 
and ileitis. Inhibition of the LTB4 biosynthetic enzyme 5-lipoxygenase inhibited 
toxin A-induced increases in ileal LTB4 levels and toxin A- but not LTB4-induced 
ileitis.
CONCLUSIONS: LTB4 mediates the inflammatory effects of toxin A via activation of 
TRPV1 receptors.

Cardiff.

A large study of the distribution of Clostridium difficile in the environment of 
the Cardiff area of South Wales was performed with a methodology designed to 
maximise recovery. A total of 2580 samples was taken, with 184 (7.1%) yielding 
isolates. The highest yield for C. difficile was obtained from river waters, 
with 14 (87.5%) of 16 samples from four rivers positive, and from sea water 
samples with 7 (44%) of 15 positive from six beaches on the Bristol Channel. In 
addition, 7 (46.7%) of 15 samples of lake water were also positive. Twenty-two 
(21%) of 104 soil samples, taken from random sites in Cardiff, were positive, as 
were 20% of environmental samples from four Cardiff hospitals. C. difficile was 
also isolated from 50% of eight swimming pool waters examined and 1 (5.5%) of 18 
of mains tap water. Carriage of C. difficile in 524 faecal samples of assorted 
farm animals was c. 1%, and was 10% in dogs and 2% in cats. In private 
residences, the organism was present in 12 (2.2%) of 550 samples. While 2.4% of 
300 raw vegetable samples were positive, none of 107 assorted fish gut contents 
was. These findings indicate that C. difficile may be more widely distributed in 
the general environment, particularly water, than was previously thought.

Clostridium difficile toxin A induces the release of neutrophil chemotactic 
factors from rat peritoneal macrophages: role of interleukin-1beta, tumor 
necrosis factor alpha, and leukotrienes.

Clostridium difficile produces a potent enterotoxin and cytotoxin, toxins A and 
B, respectively, which appear to be responsible for pseudomenbranous colitis and 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In the present study we explored the neutrophil 
migration evoked by toxin A in the peritoneal cavities and subcutaneous air 
pouches of rats and examined the role of macrophages and their inflammatory 
mediators in this process. Toxin A causes a significant dose-dependent 
neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity, with a maximal response at 0.1 
microg/ml and at 4 h. The depletion of macrophages by peritoneal washing 
prevents the toxin A-induced neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity. In 
contrast, an increase in macrophages induced by peritoneal injection of 
thioglycolate amplifies this toxin effect on neutrophil migration. Furthermore, 
the injection of supernatants from toxin A-stimulated macrophages into the rat 
peritoneal cavity causes significant neutrophil migration. Pretreatment of rats 
with BWA4C, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, mepacrine, or dexamethasone inhibits the 
neutrophil migration evoked by toxin A in the peritoneal cavities. However, 
pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the 
platelet-activating factor antagonist BN52021 fails to alter toxin A-induced 
neutrophil migration. Toxin A was also injected into air pouches of normal rats 
or rats pretreated with anti-interleukin-1beta (anti-IL-1beta) or anti-tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) antibodies. Anti-TNF-alpha or 
anti-IL-1beta antibodies significantly reduce the neutrophil migration induced 
by toxin A. These data suggest that neutrophil migration evoked by toxin A is in 
part dependent on macrophage-derived cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, 
and leukotrienes. These mediators may help to explain the intense inflammatory 
colitis caused by C. dificile toxin A in an experimental animal model of this 
disease.

Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 toxinotype V found in diarrhoeal pigs 
identical to isolates from affected humans.

Netherlands.

In diseased piglets from two Dutch pig-breeding farms with neonatal diarrhoea 
for more than a year, culture and PCR analyses identified the involved 
microorganism as Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 harbouring toxin A 
(tcdA) and B (tcdB), and binary toxin genes. Isolated strains showed a 39 bp 
deletion in the tcdC gene and they were ermB gene-negative. A number of 11 
porcine and 21 human isolated C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 toxinotype V strains 
were found genetically related by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat 
analysis (MLVA). Moreover, a clonal complex was identified, containing both 
porcine and human isolates. The porcine isolates showed an antimicrobial 
susceptibility profile overlapping that of isolates from Dutch human patients. 
On the basis of these pheno- and genotypical analyses results, it was concluded 
that the strains from affected piglets were indistinguishable from increasingly 
encountered C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 strains of human C. difficile 
infections in the Dutch population and that a common origin of animal and humans 
strains should be considered.

TcdB from Clostridium difficile glucosylates small GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) 
and is an important virulence factor in the human disease pseudomembranous 
colitis. In these experiments, in-frame genetic fusions between the genes for 
the 255 amino-terminal residues of anthrax toxin lethal factor (LFn) and the 
TcdB(1-556) coding region were constructed, expressed, and purified from 
Escherichia coli. LFnTcdB(1-556) was enzymatically active and glucosylated 
recombinant RhoA, Rac, Cdc42, and substrates from cell extracts. LFnTcdB(1-556) 
plus anthrax toxin protective antigen intoxicated cultured mammalian cells and 
caused actin reorganization and mouse lethality, all similar to those caused by 
wild-type TcdB.

Protective roles of CX3CR1-mediated signals in toxin A-induced enteritis through 
the induction of heme oxygenase-1 expression.

Author information:
(1)Department of Immunology, Institute of Advanced Medicine, Wakayama Medical 
University, Wakayama, Japan.

The injection of Clostridium difficile toxin A into the ileal loops caused fluid 
accumulation with the destruction of intestinal epithelial structure and the 
recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Concomitantly, intraileal gene 
expression of CX3CL1/fractalkine (FKN) and its receptor, CX3CR1, was enhanced. 
When treated with toxin A in a similar manner, CX3CR1-deficient (CX3CR1(-/-)) 
mice exhibited exaggerated fluid accumulation, histopathological alterations, 
and neutrophil recruitment, but not macrophage infiltration. Mice reconstituted 
with CX3CR1(-/-) mouse-derived bone marrow cells exhibited exacerbated toxin 
A-induced enteritis, indicating that the lack of the CX3CR1 gene for 
hematopoietic cells aggravated toxin A-induced enteritis. A heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1) inhibitor, tin-protoporphyrin-IX, markedly increased fluid accumulation 
in toxin A-treated wild-type mice, indicating the protective roles of HO-1 in 
this situation. HO-1 expression was detected mainly in F4/80-positive cells 
expressing CX3CR1, and CX3CR1(-/-) mice failed to increase HO-1 expression after 
toxin A treatment. Moreover, CX3CL1/FKN induced HO-1 gene expression by isolated 
lamina propria-derived macrophages or a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, 
through the activation of the ERK signal pathway. Thus, CX3CL1/FKN could induce 
CX3CR1-expressing macrophages to express HO-1, thereby ameliorating toxin 
A-induced enteritis.

In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BMY 40062, a new 
fluoronaphthyridone.

06492.

The in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, BMY 40062, were 
compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 showed about 
threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more 
activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and 
enterococci. BMY 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin 
showed against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin 
showed against these organisms. BMY 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than 
ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. The 
antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of BMY 40062 were similar to those 
of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of 
ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activities of BMY 40062 were influenced by pH and 
magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of BMY 40062 
against P. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and 
ofloxacin. BMY 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with 
other fluoroquinolones was observed. In mouse protection tests, the efficacy of 
BMY 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. BMY 40062 exhibited longer half-life, 
higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better 
bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. Compared with 
ofloxacin, BMY 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much 
longer half-life in mice. BMY 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and 
ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated 
Staphylococcus aureus.

Role of competition for nutrients in suppression of Clostridium difficile by the 
colonic microflora.

Wilson KH(1), Perini F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center, North 
Carolina 27705.

The cecal flora of mice is able to eliminate Clostridium difficile from the 
mouse cecum even when C. difficile is the first organism established. We used a 
continuous-flow (CF) culture model of the cecal flora to investigate the 
possibility that competition for nutrients is one mechanism for this antagonism. 
The medium for the CF cultures consisted of homogenates of fecal pellets from 
germfree mice. Carbohydrate analysis showed that mouse flora depleted 74 to 
99.8% of the various carbohydrates from this environment-simulating medium. When 
inoculated into filtrates made from CF cultures of mouse flora, C. difficile 
multiplied slower than the dilution rate of the CF cultures unless glucose, 
N-acetylglucosamine, or N-acetylneuraminic acid was added. C. difficile did not 
synthesize hydrolytic enzymes able to cleave these monosaccharides from 
oligosaccharide side chains. As found previously, veal infusion broth did not 
support the growth of a microflora that could be transferred to gnotobiotic mice 
and fully suppress C. difficile. When mucin or monosaccharides found in mucin 
were added to veal infusion broth, the flora functioned normally in this regard. 
These data suggest that as yet unidentified organisms compete more efficiently

Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin 
cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone 
secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in 
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Using subcellular 
fractionation procedures, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 are present 
in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only Rac1 was associated with highly 
purified synaptic vesicles. To determine the synaptic function of these GTPases, 
toxins that impair Rho-related proteins were microinjected into Aplysia neurons. 
We used lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inactivates Rac; toxin B 
from Clostridium difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; and C3 
exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from 
Escherichia coli, which mainly affect Rho. Analysis of the toxin effects on 
evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the Rho family, most 
likely Rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. 
Strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin B could 
be completely removed in <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. 
Further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin 
suggests that Rac1 protein regulates a late step in Ca(2+)-dependent 
neuroexocytosis.

difficile toxin A.

Toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are major virulence factors of Clostridium 
difficile. These two toxins intoxicate cultured cells by similar mechanisms, and 
TcdB generally is more potent than TcdA in cultured cells. The exact reason for 
this difference is unclear. Here, we report that the cellular effects of TcdA 
can be substantially enhanced via an opsonizing antibody through Fc gamma 
receptor I (FcgammaRI)-mediated endocytosis. A TcdA-specific monoclonal 
antibody, A1H3, was found to significantly enhance the cytotoxicity of TcdA to 
macrophages and monocytes. The A1H3-dependent enhancement of glucosyltransferase 
activity, cytoskeleton disruption, and tumor necrosis factor alpha production 
induced by TcdA was further demonstrated using RAW 264.7 cells. Subsequent 
experiments indicated that the interaction of FcgammaRI with A1H3 underlays the 
antibody-dependent enhancement of the cellular effects of TcdA. While blocking 
FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII with anti-CD16/32 antibodies did not affect the 
TcdA-mediated glucosylation of Rac1 in RAW 264.7 cells, presaturation of 
FcgammaRI with anti-CD64 antibodies in THP1 cells significantly reduced this 
activity. Incubation of a TcdA-A1H3 immune complex with recombinant mouse CD64 
completely abrogated the A1H3-mediated enhancement of the glucosyltransferase 
activity of TcdA in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, expression of FcgammaRI in CHO 
cells strikingly enhanced the sensitivity of these cells to TcdA complexed with 
A1H3. We showed that the presence of A1H3 facilitated cell surface recruitment 
of TcdA, contributing to the antibody-dependent, FcgammaRI-mediated enhancement 
of TcdA activity. Finally, studies using chlorpromazine and endosomal 
acidification inhibitors revealed an important role of the endocytic pathway in 
the A1H3-dependent enhancement of TcdA activity.

TLR2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via Rac1- and 
PI3K-mediated inside-out signaling in response to Porphyromonas gingivalis 
fimbriae.

Sciences Center, KY 40292, USA.

We present evidence for a novel TLR2 function in transmodulating the adhesive 
activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of Porphyromonas 
gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. 
Monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in 
atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of P. gingivalis fimbriae in 
stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial 
migration. Fimbriae induced CD11b/CD18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or 
mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor ICAM-1; these activities were 
inhibited by TLR2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of 
PI3K. Moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of 
Clostridium difficile toxin B, but was not affected by Clostridium botulinum C3 
exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. Accordingly, we subsequently 
showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small GTPases, 
that Rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind ICAM-1. A 
dominant negative mutant of Rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of 
PI3K suggesting that Rac1 acts upstream of PI3K in this proadhesive pathway. 
Furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to HUVEC and transmigration 
across HUVEC monolayers; both activities required TLR2 and Rac1 signaling and 
were dependent upon ICAM-1 and the high-affinity state of CD11b/CD18. P. 
gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration 
compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. Thus, P. 
gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, 
involving TLR2, Rac1, PI3K, and CD11b/CD18, which may constitute a mechanistic 
basis linking P. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.

chain phosphorylation in guinea-pig smooth muscle: role of Rho proteins.

1. Clostridium difficile toxin B glucosylates the Ras-related low molecular mass 
GTPases of the Rho subfamily thereby inactivating them. In the present report, 
toxin B was applied as a tool to test whether Rho proteins participate in the 
carbachol-induced increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force and myosin light 
chain (MLC) phosphorylation in intact intestinal smooth muscle. 2. Small strips 
of the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig small intestine were incubated in toxin 
B (40 ng ml-1) overnight. Carbachol-induced force and intracellular [Ca2+], and, 
in a separate series, force and MLC phosphorylation, were determined. 3. 
Carbachol induced a biphasic contraction: an initial rapid increase in force 
(peak 1) followed by a partial relaxation and a second delayed increase in force 
(peak 2). The peak of the Ca2+ signal measured with fura-2 preceded peak 1 of 
force and then declined to a lower suprabasal steady-state level. Peak 2 was not 
associated with a significant increase in [Ca2+]. Toxin B nearly completely 
inhibited peak 2 while peak 1 was not significantly inhibited. Toxin B had no 
effect on the Ca2+ transient. 4. In control strips, MLC phosphorylation at peak 
2 was 27.7% which was significantly higher than the resting value (18.6%). The 
inhibition of the second, delayed, rise in force induced by toxin B was 
associated with complete inhibition of the increase in MLC phosphorylation. The 
resting MLC phosphorylation was not significantly different from that of the 
control strips. 5. The initial increase in MLC phosphorylation determined 3 s 
after exposure to carbachol was 54% in the control strips. Toxin B also 
inhibited this initial phosphorylation peak despite the fact that the Ca2+ 
transient and the initial increase in force were not inhibited by toxin B. This 
suggests that Rho proteins play an important role in setting the balance between 
MLC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions even at high levels of 
intracellular Ca2+. 6. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 
the delayed rise in force elicited by carbachol is due to an increase in the 
Ca2+ sensitivity of MLC phosphorylation mediated by Rho proteins.

Autoantibodies to colon in germfree rats monocontaminated with Clostridium 
difficile.

Hammarström S, Perlmann P, Gustafsson BE, Lagercrantz R.

Germfree rats monocontaminated with the anaerobic microorganisms Clostridium 
difficile or another Clostridium species (strain G 62) produce auto-antibodies 
to colon antigen. The antigen can be extracted with phenol water from the feces 
of germfree rats. Antibodies, demonstrable by means of passive hemagglutination 
of antigen sensitized sheep erythrocytes appear after monocontamination for 35 
days or longer. The indirect immunofluorescence techniques, applied to sections 
of germfree rat colon, gave positive mucosal staining. The staining was similar 
to that obtained with sera from patients with ulcerative colitis or from rats 
immunized with rabbit colon. No antibodies were found in the sera of germfree 
rats, germfree rats monocontaminated with various other bacteria, conventional 
rats of germfree origin, or conventional Sprague-Dawley rats. Although the 
anti-colon antibodies of the Clostridium infected rats reacted with the same 
feces extract as the antibodies of ulcerative colitis patients or of rabbit 
colon immunized rats, their specificity was different. While the latter 
cross-react with polysaccharide from E. coli O14, those from the 
Clostridium-infected exgermfree rats did not. Rats monocontaminated with Cl. 
difficile also developed antibodies to this organism, but no cross-reaction 
between Cl. difficile antigen and colon antigen could be demonstrated. This 
speaks against breakage of tolerance by cross-reacting bacterial antigen as the 
cause of autoimmunity in these rats. Other possible mechanisms for autoantibody 
production in this model are immunogenic alteration of gastrointestinal mucins 
by bacterial degradation, adjuvant effects of bacterial products, or both.

Subsequent to myocardial infarction, cardiomyocytes within the infarcted areas 
and border zones expose phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer plasma membrane 
leaflet (flip-flop). We showed earlier that in addition to apoptosis, this 
flip-flop can be reversible in cardiomyocytes. We now investigated a possible 
role for Rho and downstream effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in the process 
of (reversible) PS exposure and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. In rat 
cardiomyoblasts (H9c2 cells) and isolated adult ventricular rat cardiomyocytes 
Clostridium difficile Toxin B (TcdB), a Rho GTPase family inhibitor, C3 
transferase (C3), a Rho(A,B,C) inhibitor and the ROCK inhibitors Y27632 and 
H1152 were used to inhibit Rho-ROCK signaling. PS exposure was assessed via flow 
cytometry and fluorescent digital imaging microscopy using annexin V. Akt 
expression and phosphorylation were analyzed via Western blot, and Akt activity 
was inhibited by wortmannin. The cellular concentration activated caspase 3 was 
determined as a measure of apoptosis, and flippase activity was assessed via 
flow cytometry using NBD-labeled PS. TcdB, C3, Y27632 and H1152 all 
significantly increased PS exposure. TcdB, Y27632 and H1152 all significantly 
inhibited phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Akt and Akt inhibition 
by wortmannin lead to increased PS exposure. However, only TcdB and C3, but not 
ROCK- or Akt inhibition led to caspase 3 activation and thus apoptosis. Notably, 
pancaspase inhibitor zVAD only partially inhibited TcdB-induced PS exposure 
indicating the existence of apoptotic and non-apoptotic PS exposure. The induced 
PS exposure coincided with decreased flippase activity as measured with 
NBD-labeled PS flip-flop. In this study, we show a regulatory role for a novel 
signaling route, Rho-ROCK-flippase signaling, in maintaining asymmetrical 
membrane phospholipid distribution in cardiomyocytes.

Trefoil peptide protection of intestinal epithelial barrier function: 
cooperative interaction with mucin glycoprotein.

Kindon H(1), Pothoulakis C, Thim L, Lynch-Devaney K, Podolsky DK.

Author information:
(1)Gastrointestinal Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Goblet cells secrete a combination of trefoil peptides and 
mucin glycoproteins to form a continuous gel on the mucosal surface. The 
functional effects of these products remain uncertain.
METHODS: Trefoil peptides and/or mucin glycoproteins were added to Transwell 
monolayers of the human colonic cancer-derived T84 cell line. Intact monolayers 
permitted penetration of < 4% of the inert marker [3H]mannitol at 4 hours. 
Exposure to the toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin (1 mg/mL), oleic acid (8 mmol/L) 
and taurocholic acid (12 mmol/L), or Clostridium difficile toxin A (0.7 
microgram/mL) resulted in loss of barrier function with 36%, 62%, and 45% of 
[3H]mannitol penetration, respectively.
RESULTS: Addition of recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor in 
physiological concentrations (1-5 micrograms/microL) resulted in attenuation of 
the damage to monolayer integrity by up to 52%. Protection was enhanced (up to 
95%) by the copresence of human colonic mucin glycoproteins. Similar effects 
were observed when rat intestinal trefoil factor or human spasmolysin, another 
human trefoil peptide, were added alone or in the presence of human mucin 
glycoproteins. Conversely, mucin glycoproteins isolated from the rat colon or 
stomach facilitated protection when added with human spasmolysin or human 
intestinal trefoil factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Trefoil peptides and mucin glycoproteins protect gastrointestinal 
mucosa from a variety of insults.

Extrinsic surgical denervation inhibits Clostridium difficile toxin A-induced 
enteritis in rats.

Mantyh CR(1), McVey DC, Vigna SR.

(1)Department of Surgery, Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.

Clostridium difficile enteritis is caused by toxin A (TA) which stimulates 
substance P release and subsequent receptor activation. This receptor 
stimulation results in secretion, inflammation, and structural damage. However, 
it is unclear as to which subset of neurons is required to initiate substance P 
release following toxin stimulation. Five centimeter ileal segments were 
surgically denervated. After 10 days, three ileal loops were constructed in each 
rat: the denervated loop was injected intraluminally with 5 microg of TA and two 
intact loops were injected with TA or vehicle, respectively. Ileal secretion, 
myeloperoxidase activity, and histology were then assessed. Denervated ileal 
loops injected with TA had a 75% reduction in ileal secretion (P < 0.001), 92% 
reduction in myeloperoxidase activity (P < 0.01) and 96% reduction in histologic 
damage (P < 0.001) compared to innervated loops. There were no significant 
differences between the denervated loops injected with TA and those injected 
with vehicle. Extrinsic surgical denervation results in protection of ileal 
loops from TA enteritis. Furthermore, these results exclude the participation of 
intrinsic enteric nerves in TA-induced ileal damage. Finally, this suggests that 
extrinsic primary sensory neurons mediate the effects of intraluminal TA in the 
ileum.

Mouse models have been developed to study the pathogenic process of Clostridium 
difficile infections, first the intestinal colonization and second the toxin 
production. These models have also been used to test the role of environmental 
conditions that modulate infection. Different mouse models have been used 
successfully to study C. difficile infections such as conventional mice, 
gnotobiotic mouse models including the monoxenic C. difficile mouse model, and 
the human microbiota-associated mouse model. The advantages and disadvantages of 
these models are discussed.

Ten healthy ponies from a single herd were found by repeated fecal culture to be 
free of Salmonella species and Clostridium cadaveris. In a preliminary study, 
four ponies administered a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg lincomycin did not 
develop idiopathic colitis when the drug was administered alone. Four other 
ponies were administered 10 mg/kg lincomycin by stomach tube together with 0.45 
L of colonic content from a horse with idiopathic colitis induced earlier by 
lincomycin alone. Two of the four ponies were treated with 25 g oral zinc 
bacitracin premix (110 g/kg active ingredient) 24 h later. Forty-two hours after 
inoculation the two untreated ponies had severe signs of idiopathic colitis and 
were euthanized. Postmortem findings were typical of idiopathic colitis. The two 
treated ponies had milder illness but the more severely affected was also 
euthanized; the other was retreated at 42 h with bacitracin pre-mix and again 12 
h later. Its illness and diarrhea resolved over the next 24 h. Clostridium 
cadaveris was isolated in large numbers from the cecum of the euthanized ponies 
and their cecal content contained mouse lethal and guinea pig dermonecrotic, but 
not cytotoxic, activity. Enterotoxins of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium 
difficile could not be demonstrated. No toxin could be demonstrated in culture 
supernatants of C. cadaveris or in supernatants of cecal contents treated with 
ethanol prior to culturing in anaerobically incubated broth. No Salmonella spp. 
were isolated. A further two ponies were administered 10 mg/kg lincomycin orally 
with 0.45 L colonic content from a horse with idiopathic colitis, as 
described.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Origin and fate of IgE-bearing lymphocytes. II. Modulation of IgE isotype 
expression on Peyer's patch cells by feeding with certain bacteria and bacterial 
cell wall components or by thymectomy.

Brooklyn 11203.

Mechanisms regulating the appearance of sIgE+ B lymphocytes appear to be lacking 
in adult germfree (GF) rats in that their Peyer's patches (PP) contain high 
numbers of cells with sIgE (approximately 15% of total cells), one-half of which 
simultaneously express sIgA, whereas sIgE+ cells are absent from PP of 
conventional rats (less than 1%). GF rat PP also contain elevated numbers of 
sIgA+ cells and decreased numbers of sIgM+ cells, with elevated numbers of 
sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells, and reduced numbers of sThy-1- RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells. 
The cellular composition of PP of GF rats was converted to that resembling a 
conventional rat within 18 h after either 1) use of standard (unautoclaved) 
food; 2) feeding with certain bacteria (Clostridium difficile, Corynebacterium 
pseudodiphtheriticum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), in 
either live or heat-killed, but not autoclaved form; or with certain bacterial 
cell wall components: murein (peptidoglycan), and its synthetic derivatives, 
muramyltripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine and desmethyl-muramyldipeptide, but 
not with LPS, core lipid A or lipoprotein; there was no effect if any bacterial 
cell wall component was injected i.v.; or 3) thymectomy. Each procedure resulted 
in elimination of sIgE+ B cells and normalization of the other surface isotypes, 
and loss of sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ Ig- T cells and normalization of sThy-1- RT 7.1+ Ig- 
T cells. Irrespective of treatment, no sIgE+ cells were detected in bone marrow, 
thymus, other lymphoid organs or blood, excluding the possibility that the 
elimination of these cells from PP was associated with their redistribution to 
other sites. Thus, exposure to gut flora and bacterial peptidoglycan components 
may have resulted in IgE isotype switching, either directly or through the 
mediation of accessory and/or sThy-1+ RT 7.1+ regulatory T cells. The sites in 
which sIgE+ B cells are down-regulated appear to be PP.

Treatment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 2H3-hm1 cells with Clostridium 
difficile toxin B (2 ng/ml), which reportedly depolymerizes the actin 
cytoskeleton, blocked [3H]serotonin release induced by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-bovine 
serum albumin, carbachol, mastoparan, and reduced ionophore A23187-stimulated 
degranulation by about 55-60%. In lysates of RBL cells, toxin B 14C-glucosylated 
two major and one minor protein. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
and immunoblotting, RhoA and Cdc42 were identified as protein substrates of 
toxin B. In contrast to toxin B, Clostridium botulinum transferase C3 that 
selectively inactivates RhoA by ADP-ribosylation did not inhibit degranulation 
up to a concentration of 150 microg/ml. Antigen-stimulated tyrosine 
phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein was inhibited by toxin B as well as by the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Depolymerization of the 
microfilament cytoskeleton of RBL cells by C. botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin 
D resulted in an increased [3H]serotonin release induced by antigen, carbachol, 
mastoparan, or by calcium ionophore A23187, but without affecting toxin 
B-induced inhibition of degranulation. The data indicate that toxin B inhibits 
activation of RBL cells by glucosylation of low molecular mass GTP-binding 
proteins of the Rho subfamily (most likely Cdc42) by a mechanism not involving 
the actin cytoskeleton.

Toxin A from Clostridium difficile mediates acute inflammatory enterocolitis in 
experimental animals, while cholera toxin causes noninflammatory secretory 
diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an antagonist to 
the peptide substance P, a constituent of primary sensory neurons known to 
participate in inflammatory responses, would inhibit toxin A-mediated enteritis 
in the rat ileum. Pretreatment of rats with CP-96,345 (2.5 mg per kg of body 
weight), a substance P antagonist, dramatically inhibited fluid secretion (P < 
0.01) and mannitol permeability (P < 0.01) in ileal loops exposed to toxin A. 
The protective effects, which were dose dependent, caused a significant 
reduction of inflammation in the lamina propria, reduction of the necrosis of 
intestinal epithelial cells, and complete inhibition of toxin A-mediated release 
of rat mast cell protease II, a specific product of rat mucosal mast cells. An 
inactive enantiomer of the substance P antagonist, CP-96,344, had no effect. In 
contrast, pretreatment with CP-96,345 had no inhibitory effect on the intestinal 
effects caused by administration of cholera toxin into the ileal loops. From 
these data, we conclude that the peptide substance P is involved in the 
secretory and inflammatory effects of toxin A but not of cholera toxin.

Bacteriodaceae (B-strains), three strains of Lactobacillus (L-strains) and a 
chloroform-treated fecal suspension (CHF, Clostridium mixture) were prepared 
from conventional Wistar rats as the microflora source. Two groups of 
limited-flora rats, E. coli plus B-strains and E. coli plus CHF, were produced. 
After confirmation that Clostridium difficile was not detected in the 
CHF-inoculated rats, two groups of limited-flora rats were transferred to an 
isolator and housed together in a cage. These rats were then orally inoculated 
with L-strains. The gnotobiotic rats showed colonization resistance to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the number of E. coli in the feces was 10(5) to 
10(6)/g. The gnotobiotic rats were transferred to a barrier room as a source of 
intestinal flora for SPF colonies. In the SPF rats, basic cecal flora was mainly 
composed of Bacteroidaceae, clostridia, fusiform-shaped bacteria and 
lactobacilli, and did not change over a long period. Their flora became similar 
to that of conventional rats.

Bacillus pumilus in the induction of clindamycin-associated enterocolitis in 
guinea pigs.

Brophy PF, Knoop FC.

Antibiotic-associated enterocolitis was induced in guinea pigs by the 
intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin. The colonic and cecal mucosa and feces 
of acutely ill animals were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on 
5% sheep blood agar plates and on a selective and differential medium for 
Clostridium difficile. All morphologically distinct colony types were isolated 
in pure culture and identified. A sterile cell-free filtrate of each isolate was 
tested for ability to induce morphological changes in cultured monolayers of 
mouse adrenal cells. The filtrate of a predominant isolate, Bacillus pumilus, 
induced an alteration of cellular morphology; the sterile filtrate of other 
isolates were unreactive. Toxin contained in cell-free filtrates of B. pumilus 
caused a syndrome identical to clindamycin-associated enterocolitis when 
injected intracecally into guinea pigs. The toxin had a molecular weight of 
6,500 daltons as determined by molecular sieve chromatography and was 
inactivated with pronase, lipase, and trypsin. The minimal inhibitory 
concentrations of clindamycin and vancomycin for B. pumilus were 50 
micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms/ml, respectively.

Comment in
    Gut. 1997 Nov;41(5):719-20.

BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF) is a recently identified regulatory 
protein which inhibits the intestinal fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin.
AIMS: To test the effect of AF on: (a) inflammation and hypersecretion induced 
by toxin A from Clostridium difficile; and (b) morphological changes and 
hypersecretion induced by okadaic acid (the blue mussel toxin) in rat intestinal 
mucosa.
METHODS: Morphological changes and fluid accumulation were observed in 
intestinal loops challenged with 1 microgram of toxin A or 3 micrograms of 
okadaic acid administered before or after injection of 0.1 microgram of 
recombinant AF (rAF).
RESULTS: The cytotoxic and inflammatory reaction caused by toxin A was abolished 
after treatment with rAF given either intraveneously or intraluminally prior to 
the toxin or one hour after the toxin. The intestinal fluid response induced by 
toxin A and okadaic acid was reduced 55-80% by rAF. However, the characteristic 
increase in goblet cells at the tips of villi in the okadaic acid treated mucosa 
was not inhibited by rAF.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that AF might be involved in protection against 
inflammation and in counteracting dehydration caused by enterotoxins. Both 
effects are probably mediated via the enteric nervous system.

Effect of Clostridium difficile toxin B on IgE receptor-mediated signal 
transduction in rat basophilic leukemia cells: inhibition of phospholipase D 
activation.

Antigen (Ag)-stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activation and secretion were 
almost abolished by pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells for 
4 h with 5 ng/ml Clostridium difficile Toxin B which is known to inhibit Rho 
family proteins (Rho, Cdc42, Rac). The concentration-dependent inhibition of PLD 
activation was well correlated with the level of glucosylation of Rho family 
proteins. In streptolysin O-permeabilized RBL cells, Toxin B suppressed [3H] 
phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) formation in response to guanosine 
5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA) by 67 and 43%, respectively. The synergistic PLD activation by GTP gamma S 
and PMA was also reduced by Toxin B by 67%. These results suggest that the IgE 
receptor-coupled PLD activation is largely mediated by Rho proteins.

Structural microdomains in the lateral plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair 
cells.

Cell and Molecular Biology, House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90057, USA.

The basal and lateral regions of the plasma membrane of cochlear outer hair 
cells are structurally and functionally distinct. The lateral region contains 
thousands of motor proteins but few voltage-gated channels. The basal region, 
conversely, contains a high number of voltage-gated channels but is devoid of 
motor proteins. It has been suggested that the cortical cytoskeleton is 
responsible for maintaining this regional distinction. Toward elucidating the 
structure of the outer hair cell's electromotile mechanism, we investigated the 
physical organization of the lateral plasma membrane in living guinea pig outer 
hair cells by analyzing the distribution pattern of the anionic long-chain 
carbocyanine SP-DiIC18(3) within this area, before and after electrical 
stimulation and with an intact and a disrupted cytoskeleton. We observed 
punctate, intensely fluorescent patches as well as areas of weaker fluorescence, 
with clear local maxima and minima, upon labeling the cells with this 
membrane-soluble probe. This discrete distribution of SP-DilC18(3) suggests that 
the lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells may be composed of 
small structural domains (microdomains). Disrupting the cytoskeleton with either 
trypsin or toxin B from Clostridium difficile did not change this pattern of 
distribution, thus indicating that this treatment did not facilitate the lateral 
diffusion of the probes. Electrical stimulation using whole-cell patch-clamp 
techniques, on the other hand, induced two responses: fast motility and 
reversible displacement of the fluorescent probes. Both responses were inhibited 
by internal perfusion with salicylate, while disruption of the cytoskeleton did 
not inhibit OHC fast motility but affected the electrically induced 
redistribution of fluorescent probes. Together, these results suggest that the 
lateral plasma membrane of guinea pig outer hair cells contains structural 
microdomains and that the cytoskeleton does not appear to be playing a major 
role in maintaining the lateral separation of these distinct molecular regions.

The epithelial cells of the gut form a physical barrier against the luminal 
contents. The collapse of this barrier causes inflammation, and its therapeutic 
restoration can protect the gut against inflammation. EGF enhances mucosal 
barrier function and increases colonocyte proliferation, thereby ameliorating 
inflammatory responses in the gut. Based on our previous finding that the insect 
peptide CopA3 promotes neuronal growth, we herein tested whether CopA3 could 
increase the cell proliferation of colonocytes, enhance mucosal barrier 
function, and ameliorate gut inflammation. Our results revealed that CopA3 
significantly increased epithelial cell proliferation in mouse colonic crypts 
and also enhanced colonic epithelial barrier function. Moreover, CopA3 treatment 
ameliorated Clostridium difficile toxin As-induced inflammation responses in the 
mouse small intestine (acute enteritis) and completely blocked inflammatory 
responses and subsequent lethality in the dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse 
model of chronic colitis. The marked CopA3-induced increase of colonocyte 
proliferation was found to require rapid protein degradation of p21(Cip1/Waf1), 
and an in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that CopA3 directly facilitated 
ubiquitin ligase activity against p21(Cip1/Waf1). Taken together, our findings 
indicate that the insect peptide CopA3 prevents gut inflammation by increasing 
epithelial cell proliferation and mucosal barrier function.

To activate the GTPase Rac in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and mouse bone 
marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) a TAT fusion toxin of Bordetella dermonecrotic 
toxin (DNT-TAT) was constructed. The fusion toxin activated Rac1 and RhoA in 
vitro but only Rac in RBL cells and BMMC. DNT-TAT caused an increase in inositol 
phosphate formation, calcium mobilization, ERK activation and degranulation of 
mast cells. All these effects were inhibited by the Rho GTPase-inactivating 
Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Also the 
calcium ionophore A23187 caused mast cell activation, including ERK 
phosphorylation, by processes involving an activation of Rac. The data indicate 
pleiotropic functions of Rac in mast cell activation.

Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile toxin A causes secretion and intestinal 
inflammation in rodents by binding to a specific trisaccharide Gal alpha 1-3Gal 
beta 1-4 GlcNAc on enterocyte receptors. The purpose of this study was to 
explore the ability of Synsorb 90 (Synsorb Biotech Inc., Calgary, Alberta, 
Canada), and inert support carrying this trisaccharide, to bind toxin A in vitro 
and to inhibit its enterotoxic effects in vivo.
METHODS: Binding of [3H]toxin A to Synsorb 90, Synsorb 83 (beta-mannose 
attached), and Chromosorb P (inert support with no sugar attached) (Synsorb 
Biotech Inc.) was measured. The inhibitory effects of these compounds on toxin 
A-mediated fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, and histological damage were 
measured in ileal loops in vivo.
RESULTS: Toxin A showed specific binding to Synsorb 90, bearing the specific 
trisaccharide that binds toxin A, but not to Synsorb 83 or to Chromosorb P. 
Pretreatment of rats with Synsorb 90 by gavage (200 mg/kg body wt), but no 
Synsorb 83 or Chromosorb P at the same doses, dramatically reduced toxin 
A-associated fluid secretion and permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: An immobilized toxin A receptor sequesters toxin A in the 
intestinal lumen and inhibits its effects of ileal mucosa. These results suggest 
a potential use for this agent in treating patients with C. difficile colitis.

Clostridium difficile strains of toxinotypes III (n = 13) and V (n = 45) were 
typed by agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping, capillary gel electrophoresis-based 
PCR ribotyping and PFGE using two different restriction enzymes, SmaI and SacII. 
With conventional agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping, toxinotype III strains were 
distributed among six different PCR ribotypes and toxinotype V strains into 
three different PCR ribotypes. Capillary gel electrophoresis-based ribotyping 
was more discriminatory for toxinotype V strains, with six different ribotypes 
found. With PFGE using SmaI, all toxinotype III strains grouped together into a 
single pulsotype. Using SacII, ribotype 027 strains grouped together with >90 % 
similarity and were <83 % similar to other ribotypes of toxinotype III strains. 
Within ribotype 078, seven (SmaI) and eight (SacII) different pulsotypes were 
found, whilst ribotype 126 strains belonged to one (SmaI) and two (SacII) 
pulsotypes. Within ribotype 066, it was possible to distinguish between pig and 
human isolates. Using SacII, a further distinction could also be made between 
pig isolates from two different farms. PFGE (SmaI and SacII) clustered strains 
according to their toxinotype; however, correlation of PFGE and ribotyping was 
better with SacII. These data suggest that toxinotype III strains are a more 
heterogeneous group than toxinotype V strains and that SacII is more 
discriminatory than SmaI. Alternatively, the use of both enzymes simultaneously 
could improve PFGE typing of C. difficile.

Surotomycin (formerly called CB-183,315) is a novel, orally administered cyclic 
lipopeptide antibacterial in development for the treatment of Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI) that has potent activity against vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci (VRE) but limited activity against Gram-negative bacilli, including 
Bacteroides spp. We used a mouse model to investigate the impact of surotomycin 
exposure on the microbiome, and to test the consequences of the disruption on 
colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), in comparison with the 
effects of oral vancomycin and metronidazole. Mice (8 per group) received 
saline, vancomycin, metronidazole, or surotomycin through an orogastric tube 
daily for 5 days and were challenged with 10(5) CFU of VRE or ESBL-KP 
administered through an orogastric tube on day 2 of treatment. The 
concentrations of the pathogens in stool were determined during and after 
treatment by plating on selective media. A second experiment was conducted to 
determine if the antibiotics would inhibit established VRE colonization. In 
comparison to controls, oral vancomycin promoted VRE and ESBL-KP overgrowth in 
stool (8 log10 to 10 log10 CFU/g; P < 0.001), whereas metronidazole did not (<4 
log10 CFU/g; P > 0.5). Surotomycin promoted ESBL-KP overgrowth (>8 log10 CFU/g; 
P, <0.001 for comparison with saline controls) but not VRE overgrowth. 
Surotomycin suppressed preexisting VRE colonization, whereas metronidazole and 
vancomycin did not. These results suggest that treatment of CDI with surotomycin 
could reduce levels of VRE acquisition and overgrowth from those with agents 
such as vancomycin and metronidazole. However, surotomycin and vancomycin may 
promote colonization by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

Gnotobiotic models for study of the microbial ecology of Clostridium difficile 
and Escherichia coli.

Wilson KH, Sheagren JN, Freter R, Weatherbee L, Lyerly D.

Hamster flora introduced into germfree mice reduced the cecum to conventional 
size, suppressed populations of Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile to 
the same degree that mouse flora did, and corrected the hypocellularity that is 
characteristic of the small bowel of germfree mice. A highly toxigenic strain of 
C. difficile readily induced cecitis in germfree and antibiotic-treated 
conventional mice, and histological examination frequently revealed 
pseudomembranes. Toxins A and B were both detected in ceca of animals with 
colitis. Gnotobiotic mice provide a model in which to study the role of the 
indigenous microflora in protecting against antibiotic-associated colitis.

Novel antibody constructs consisting of two or more different camelid 
heavy-chain only antibodies (VHHs) joined via peptide linkers have proven to 
have potent toxin-neutralizing activity in vivo against Shiga, botulinum, 
Clostridium difficile, anthrax, and ricin toxins. However, the mechanisms by 
which these so-called bispecific VHH heterodimers promote toxin neutralization 
remain poorly understood. In the current study we produced a new collection of 
ricin-specific VHH heterodimers, as well as VHH homodimers, and characterized 
them for their ability neutralize ricin in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate 
that the VHH heterodimers, but not homodimers were able to completely protect 
mice against ricin challenge, even though the two classes of antibodies 
(heterodimers and homodimers) had virtually identical affinities for ricin 
holotoxin and similar IC50 values in a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay. The VHH 
heterodimers did differ from the homodimers in their ability to promote toxin 
aggregation in solution, as revealed through analytical ultracentrifugation. 
Moreover, the VHH heterodimers that were most effective at promoting ricin 
aggregation in solution were also the most effective at blocking ricin 
attachment to cell surfaces. Collectively, these data suggest that heterodimeric 
VHH-based neutralizing agents may function through the formation of 
antibody-toxin complexes that are impaired in their ability to access host cell 
receptors.

The effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily 
gain and mortality in 4 Danish pig herds.

BACKGROUND: The study evaluated the effect of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea 
Syndrome (NNPDS) on average daily gain (ADG) and mortality and described the 
clinical manifestations in four herds suffering from the syndrome. NNPDS is a 
diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life, which is 
not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens 
(C. perfringens) type A/C, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), rotavirus A, 
coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp or 
Cryptosporidium spp.
RESULTS: Piglets were estimated to have a negative ADG of 9 and 14 g when 
diarrhoeic for 1 day and >1 day respectively. However, if only diarrhoeic on the 
day of birth, no negative effect on ADG was seen. Piglets originating from 
severely affected litters were estimated to have a reduced ADG of 38 g. The 
study did not show an overall effect of diarrhoea on mortality, but herd of 
origin, sow parity, birth weight, and gender were significantly associated with 
mortality. In one of the herds, approximately 25% of the diarrhoeic piglets vs. 
6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets died, and 74% of necropsied piglets were 
diagnosed with enteritis. These findings indicate that the high mortality seen 
in this herd was due to diarrhoea.
CONCLUSIONS: NNPDS negatively affected ADG in piglets, and even piglets that 
were diarrhoeic for one day only experienced a reduction in ADG. However, the 
study showed that diarrhoea restricted to the day of birth did not affect ADG 
and suggested this phenomenon to be unrelated to the syndrome. Since the 
diarrhoeal status of the litter had important effects on ADG, future research on 
NNPDS probably ought to focus on piglets from severely affected litters.The 
study showed important dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the 
herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. Within this 
herd, NNPDS seemed to be associated with a higher mortality, whereas in general 
the study did not show lethal effects of NNPDS.

Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) was initially identified in mammals as a 
hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating appetite and energy balance. However, the 
wide distribution of MCH receptors in peripheral tissues suggests additional 
functions for MCH which remain largely unknown. We have previously reported that 
mice lacking MCH develop attenuated intestinal inflammation when exposed to 
Clostridium difficile toxin A. To further characterize the role of MCH in host 
defense mechanisms against intestinal pathogens, Salmonella enterocolitis (using 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) was induced in MCH-deficient mice and 
their wild-type littermates. In the absence of MCH, infected mice had increased 
mortality associated with higher bacterial loads in blood, liver, and spleen. 
Moreover, the knockout mice developed more-severe intestinal inflammation, based 
on epithelial damage, immune cell infiltrates, and local and systemic cytokine 
levels. Paradoxically, these enhanced inflammatory responses in the MCH knockout 
mice were associated with disproportionally lower levels of macrophages 
infiltrating the intestine. Hence, we investigated potential direct effects of 
MCH on monocyte/macrophage functions critical for defense against intestinal 
pathogens. Using RAW 264.7 mouse monocytic cells, which express endogenous MCH 
receptor, we found that treatment with MCH enhanced the phagocytic capacity of 
these cells. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated 
role for MCH in host-bacterial interactions.

SYN-004 is a first in class, recombinant β-lactamase that degrades β-lactam 
antibiotics and has been formulated to be administered orally to patients 
receiving intravenous β-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins. SYN-004 is 
intended to degrade unmetabolized antibiotics excreted into the intestines and 
thus has the potential to protect the gut microbiome from disruption by these 
antibiotics. Protection of the gut microbiome is expected to protect against 
opportunistic enteric infections such as Clostridium difficile infection as well 
as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In order to demonstrate that oral SYN-004 is 
safe for human clinical trials, 2 Good Laboratory Practice-compliant toxicity 
studies were conducted in Beagle dogs. In both studies, SYN-004 was administered 
orally 3 times per day up to the maximum tolerated dose of the formulation. In 
the first study, doses of SYN-004 administered over 28 days were safe and well 
tolerated in dogs with the no-observed-adverse-effect level at the high dose of 
57 mg/kg/day. Systemic absorption of SYN-004 was minimal and sporadic and showed 
no accumulation during the study. In the second study, doses up to 57 mg/kg/day 
were administered to dogs in combination with an intravenous dose of ceftriaxone 
(300 mg/kg) given once per day for 14 days. Coadministration of oral SYN-004 
with intravenous ceftriaxone was safe and well tolerated, with SYN-004 having no 
noticeable effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone. These 
preclinical studies demonstrate that SYN-004 is well tolerated and, when 
coadministered with ceftriaxone, does not interfere with its systemic 
pharmacokinetics. These data supported advancing SYN-004 into human clinical 
trials.

gastrointestinal tract.

Gastrointestinal survival of the bacteriocin-producing strain, Lactococcus 
lactis DPC6520, was evaluated systematically in vitro and in vivo with a view to 
using this strain to deliver biologically active lacticin 3147, a broad-spectrum 
bacteriocin, to the gut. The activity of the lacticin 3147 producer was also 
evaluated against two clinically relevant pathogens: Clostridium difficile and 
Listeria monocytogenes. When suspended in an appropriate matrix, the lactococcal 
strain is capable of surviving simulated gastrointestinal juices similar to the 
porcine probiotic, Lactobacillus salivarius DPC6005. Upon administration of L. 
lactis DPC6520 to pigs (n=4), excretion rates of ∼10(2) -10(5) CFU g(-1) faeces 
were observed by day 5. Although passage through the gastrointestinal tract 
(GIT) did not affect lacticin 3147 production by L. lactis DPC6520 isolates, 
activity was undetectable in faecal samples by an agar well diffusion assay. 
Furthermore, L. lactis DPC6520 had no inhibitory effect on C. difficile or other 
bacterial populations in a human distal colon model, while lactococcal counts 
declined 10,000-fold over 24 h. The lacticin 3147 producer failed to prevent L. 
monocytogenes infection in a mouse model, even though a mean L. lactis DPC6520 
count of 4.7 × 10(4) CFU g(-1) faeces was obtained over the 5-day administration 
period. These data demonstrate that L. lactis DPC6520 is capable of surviving 
transit through the GIT, and yet lacks antimicrobial efficacy in the models of 
infection used.

Hepatobiliary transport of IgA in the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus 
auratus).

Molecular Pathology, Brussels, Belgium. vaerman@mexp.ucl.ac.be

Do hamsters, like rats, rabbits and mice, possess an hepatocyte 'IgA pump' 
whereby circulating plasma polymeric IgA (pIgA) is actively transported into 
bile, against a concentration gradient, via the polymeric Ig receptor or 
secretory component (SC)? Precipitating antisera, raised against rat Igs and 
serum proteins, and crossreacting with their hamster homologues, detected 
hamster SC by immunoelectrophoresis in bile, but not serum. Gel filtration of 
hamster bile indicated that free SC eluted between IgG and albumin, as for other 
mammals. Hamster bile IgA was pIgA, and was true secretory IgA (SIgA) by its 
reaction with anti-SC antiserum and by SDS-PAGE with reduction. Hamster serum 
IgA comprised both pIgA and IgA monomers. Mean bile-to-serum concentration 
ratios (B/S) for IgA, IgG, transferrin and albumin, measured by radial 
immunodiffusion, were 2.65, 0.019, 0.024, and 0.016, respectively, demonstrating 
strongly selective enrichment of bile in IgA. Human 125I-labelled dimeric IgA 
was injected into the circulation of five hamsters with cannulated bile ducts; 
20% of the [125I]IgA (> 95% precipitable by trichloroacetic acid) was recovered 
in bile within 5 h, a figure close to that for mice, but smaller than that for 
rats and rabbits. The data suggest that bile significantly contributes to 
hamster intestinal SIgA, as shown for rats, rabbits and mice. This could be 
relevant to studies where hamsters are used as an experimental model for 
infection by the human intestinal pathogen, Clostridium difficile.

The expression of the negative Regulator of G protein signaling 16 (RGS16) is 
rapidly induced in cardiomyocytes by various stimuli. To identify the promoter 
of the mouse RGS16 gene, a 1.8-kb deoxyribonucleic acid fragment 5' of the 
RGS16-coding region was subcloned into a firefly-luciferase reporter vector and 
four overlapping fragments were analyzed. The luciferase production was 
quantified in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM). A 0.6-kb fragment that 
induced a tenfold increase in luciferase activity contained the minimal promoter 
sequence. Its activity was twofold stimulated by fetal calf serum, endothelin-1 
(ET-1), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which stimuli also elevated the level 
of RGS16 protein. Stimulation of NRCM with ET-1 induced activation of the 
monomeric GTPases RhoA and Rac1, whereas S1P and the selective S1P1 receptor 
agonist SEW2871 only induced a pronounced activation of Rac1. In accordance, the 
treatment with the Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-inactivating Clostridium difficile 
Toxin B (TcdB) 10463 inhibited ET-1 and S1P-induced transcriptional activation. 
The ET-1-induced activation was insensitive to pertussis toxin but selectively 
suppressed by the RhoA-C-specific C2I-C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase and the ET(B) 
receptor antagonist BQ788. The S1P-induced activation was specifically inhibited 
by pertussis toxin and the Rac-inactivating TcdB 1470. All stimulated 
transcriptional activity was abolished by the negative transcription factor Yin 
Yang 1 (YY1), which binds to a consensus sequence within the minimal promoter. 
Taken together, our data show that most likely ET(B)- and S1P1-receptors induce 
RGS16 protein expression in cardiac myocytes by increasing the transcriptional 
activity of the rgs16 gene. This activation is mediated by heterotrimeric G 
proteins, Rho GTPases, and is under negative control of the transcription factor 
YY1.

Increased substance P receptor expression by blood vessels and lymphoid 
aggregates in Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis.

Pseudomembranous colitis is most often caused by toxins secreted by Clostridium 
difficile following bowel flora overgrowth after antibiotic use. The secretory 
and inflammatory effects observed in C. difficile toxin A-induced enterocolitis 
in the rat ileum are inhibited by CP-96,345, a substance P (SP) receptor 
antagonist. To determine if SP plays a role in the pathogenesis of human 
pseudomembranous colitis, SP receptor distribution was examined in a toxin 
A-positive specimen of bowel. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to 
examine SP receptors in tissue from a patient who tested positive for C. 
Difficile toxin. SP receptors were massively increased in small blood vessels 
and lymphoid aggregates in the pseudomembranous colitis bowel in comparison to 
control specimens. The SP binding was saturable and exhibited similar affinities 
for SP and CP-96,345. SP may contribute to the inflammatory response in 
pseudomembranous colitis via a massive increase in SP receptor antagonists may 
offer a novel therapeutic intervention for pseudomembranous colitis.

Rho GTPase, Rac1, regulates Skp2 levels, vascular smooth muscle cell 
proliferation, and intima formation in vitro and in vivo.

Infirmary, Bristol BS2 8HW, UK. mark.bond@bristol.ac.uk

AIMS: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation contributes to intima 
formation after angioplasty or venous by-pass grafting, and during 
atherosclerosis. VSMC proliferation requires degradation of p27(Kip1) promoted 
by S-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2), an F-box protein component of the 
Skp-Cullin-F-box(Skp2) ubiquitin-ligase. We investigated the role of Rac(1) in 
the regulation of Skp2 in rat VSMC.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Rat carotid balloon injury increased Rac(1) activity. Rho 
GTPase inhibition with Clostridium difficile Toxin B or specific Rac(1) 
inhibition with adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant-negative Rac(1) 
reduced Skp2 levels, and VSMC proliferation in vitro and intima formation in 
vivo following carotid balloon injury. Inhibition of Skp2 expression and 
proliferation by dominant-negative Rac(1) was reversed by exogenous Skp2. 
Elevation of endogenous adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) with 
forskolin-inhibited Rac(1) activity, reduced Skp2, increased p27(Kip1) and 
inhibited VSMC proliferation, effects that were reversed by constitutively 
active Rac(1). These effects were independent of Rac(1) Cdc42/Rac interactive 
binding (CRIB)-domain effector proteins but associated with Rac(1)-dependent 
actin polymerization.
CONCLUSION: Rac(1) activity regulates VSMC proliferation by controlling Skp2 
levels. Activation of Rac(1) induced by balloon injury in vivo increases Skp2 
levels, which promotes VSMC proliferation and intima formation. Inhibition of 
this novel pathway underlies the negative effects of cAMP on VSMC proliferation.

GT160-246, a high-molecular-weight soluble anionic polymer, was tested in vitro 
and in vivo for neutralization of Clostridium difficile toxin A and B 
activities. Five milligrams of GT160-246 per ml neutralized toxin-mediated 
inhibition of protein synthesis in Vero cells induced by 5 ng of toxin A per ml 
or 1.25 ng of toxin B per ml. In ligated rat ileal loops, 1 mg of GT160-246 
neutralized fluid accumulation caused by 5 microg of toxin A. At doses as high 
as 80 mg/loop, cholestyramine provided incomplete neutralization of fluid 
accumulation caused by 5 microg of toxin A. GT160-246 protected 80% of the 
hamsters from mortality caused by infection with C. difficile, whereas 
cholestyramine protected only 10% of animals. Treatment of C. difficile-infected 
hamsters with metronidazole initially protected 100% of the hamsters from 
mortality, but upon removal of treatment, 80% of the hamsters had relapses and 
died. In contrast, removal of GT160-246 treatment did not result in disease 
relapse in the hamsters. GT160-246 showed no antimicrobial activity in tests 
with a panel of 16 aerobic bacteria and yeast and 22 anaerobic bacteria and did 
not interfere with the in vitro activities of most antibiotics. GT160-246 offers 
a novel, nonantimicrobial treatment of C. difficile disease in humans.

Cytotoxic and cytotonic factors produced by Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter 
coli, and Campylobacter laridis.

Johnson WM, Lior H.

Complete toxigenicity studies were performed on 341 strains of Campylobacter 
spp., including 23 nonhuman isolates. Toxin profiles based on both cytotonic and 
cytotoxic factors were determined after analyzing responses in Vero, HeLa, CHO 
and Y-1 cells. Suckling mouse assays were consistently negative for all culture 
filtrates tested. Toxin-producing strains were frequently encountered among both 
the human and nonhuman strains of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and C. laridis 
investigated. Strains isolated from outbreaks demonstrated parallels in 
serotype, biotype, and toxigenicity profile, although no clear association could 
be demonstrated. Biphasic culture conditions conducive to the production of both 
toxic factors were delineated for the propagation of test Campylobacter strains. 
Cytotonic effects of Campylobacter culture filtrates were determined in Vero and 
CHO cells, and cyclic AMP accumulation in cells exposed to these culture 
filtrates was compared with that in cells exposed to reference toxigenic strains 
of Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli. Partial neutralization of C. jejuni 
enterotoxin was demonstrated by using antitoxins to cholera toxin and E. coli 
heat-labile enterotoxin. No neutralization of C. jejuni cytotoxin could be 
achieved by using antitoxins to either Clostridium difficile cytotoxin or E. 
coli Verotoxin (0157:H7).

Aldosterone induces superoxide generation via Rac1 activation in endothelial 
cells.

Currently, aldosterone is believed to be involved in the development of 
cardiovascular injury as a potential cardiovascular risk hormone. However, its 
exact cellular mechanisms remain obscure. This study was undertaken to examine 
the effect of aldosterone on superoxide production in cultured rat aortic 
endothelial cells with possible involvement of the small GTP-binding (G) protein 
Rac1. The aldosterone levels showed a time-dependent (6-24 h) and dose-dependent 
(10(-8) to 10(-6) m) increase in superoxide generation, whose effect was 
abolished by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eplerenone), Src inhibitor 
(PP2), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase 
inhibitor (apocynin). Aldosterone activated NADP(H) oxidase and Rac1, whose 
effects were abolished by eplerenone. The aldosterone-induced superoxide 
generation was abolished either by nonselective small G protein inhibitor 
(Clostridium difficile toxin A) or dominant-negative Rac1. Dominant-negative 
Rac1 also inhibited aldosterone-induced ACE gene expression. Thus, the present 
study is the first to demonstrate that aldosterone induces superoxide generation 
via mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated activation of NAD(P)H-oxidase and Rac1 
in endothelial cells, thereby contributing to the development of 
aldosterone-induced vascular injury.

Presence of Clostridium difficile toxin in guinea pigs with 
penicillin-associated colitis.

Rothman SW.

Cecal filtrates from guinea pigs treated with penicillin contained a toxin which 
produced cytotoxic changes in HeLa cell cultures and was lethal to guinea pigs 
when administered intracecally. The cytotoxicity could be neutralized by 
Clostridium difficile and C. sordellii antitoxins, but not by other clostridial 
antitoxins. Rabbit immunization with toxic cecal extracts produced antibody 
which neutralized the cytotoxicity of guinea pig cecal extracts, of stool 
extracts from humans with antibiotic-associated colitis and of culture 
supernatant fluids of C. difficile. Treatment with vancomycin reduced the number 
of deaths and increased the survival time of penicillin-treated animals. No 
cytotoxin was present in cecal extracts from these guinea pigs. Gram-negative 
bacteremia was present in half the penicillin-treated animals, the sick ones as 
well as the healthy ones. Treatment with vancomycin did not decrease the 
incidence of bacteremia. Gram-negative bacteremia and changes in fecal flora 
were observed in some antibiotic-treated guinea pigs; all diseased animals, 
however, contained this cytotoxin. C. difficile was isolated from cecal contents 
of sick animals and these isolates produced the cytotoxin in vitro. The results 
suggest that C. difficile toxin can cause antibiotic-associated colitis in 
guinea pigs.

The probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that has been 
proven efficient in the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea and of 
Clostridium difficile associated colitis. We evaluated the influence of the 
administration of S. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a 
human microbiota-associated mouse model. This evaluation was run before, during 
and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. Predominant 
groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization 
combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16S rRNA targeted 
oligonucleotide probes designed for the Eubacteria, 
Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, 
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium histolyticum, 
Lactobacillus-Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae groups and Bifidobacterium 
species. S. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic 
microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. During the antibiotic treatment in 
the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of 
Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides groups increased when the C. coccoides-E. 
rectale group decreased dramatically. After the antibiotic treatment was 
discontinued, the return to the initial level was reached more rapidly in the S. 
boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the C. coccoides-E. 
rectale and Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella groups. This quicker recovery 
of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a 
mechanism for S. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
in humans.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the surface receptor for toxin A, 
the enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, on rabbit intestinal brush borders 
(BB) and on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Purified toxin A was 
radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 
microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound 
specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with 
dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL 
cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific 
binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to 
toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin 
or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation 
of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, 
and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The 
addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with 
rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or 
Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate 
that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and 
N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G 
protein.

Inhibitory effects of mevastatin and a geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor 
(GGTI-2166) on mononuclear osteoclast formation induced by receptor activator of 
NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).

University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 E. Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 
60611, USA.

We have previously reported that the statin mevastatin (compactin) reversibly 
inhibits the fusion of TRAP-positive mononuclear preosteoclasts (pOCs) into 
multinucleated osteoclasts and disrupts the actin ring in mature osteoclasts 
through the inhibition of protein prenylation. Protein geranylgeranylation, 
specifically, is known to be required for pOC fusion and for the function and 
survival of mature osteoclasts. However, it has not been determined whether 
protein geranylgeranylation is involved in early differentiation of osteoclasts 
(pOC formation). The current study shows that statins and the geranylgeranyl 
transferase I inhibitor GGTI-2166 inhibit the pOC formation induced by RANKL or 
TNF-alpha in cultures of both mouse marrow-derived macrophage-colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF) dependent monocytes (MD cells) and the mouse monocyte cell line 
RAW 264.7 (RAW cells). Mevastatin, 0.1-0.6 microM, inhibited the formation of 
pOCs induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) or 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in both cell cultures. The inhibitory effects 
of mevastatin were overcome by the addition of mevalonate, farnesyl 
pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. GGTI-2166 inhibited TRAP activity 
induced by RANKL or TNF-alpha in both cell cultures and prevented the 
incorporation of [3H]all-trans geranylgeraniol into prenylated proteins in RAW 
cells. However, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-2153 did not inhibit TRAP 
activity although FTI prevented the incorporation of [14C]mevalonate into 
farnesylated proteins in RAW cells. Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B (toxin B) 
inhibited pOC formation induced by RANKL or TNF-alpha in both cell cultures. The 
inhibitory effects of statins and GGTI-2166 on pOC formation may result from the

The enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) monoglucosylates the Rho 
proteins.

The enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) is one of the causative agents 
of the antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In cultured monolayer 
cells ToxA exhibits cytotoxic activity to induce disassembly of the actin 
cytoskeleton, which is accompanied by morphological changes. ToxA-induced 
depolymerization of actin filaments is correlated with a decrease in the 
ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins (Just, I., 
Selzer, J., von Eichel-Streiber, C., and Aktories, K. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 
95, 1026-1031). Here we report on the identification of the ToxA-induced 
modification of Rho. Applying electrospray mass spectrometry, the mass of the 
modification was determined as 162 Da, which is consistent with the 
incorporation of a hexose into Rho. From several hexoses tested UDP-glucose 
selectively served as cosubstrate for ToxA-catalyzed modification. The acceptor 
amino acid of glucosylation was identified from a Lys-C-generated peptide by 
tandem mass spectrometry as Thr-37. Mutation of Thr-37 to Ala completely 
abolished glucosylation. The members of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) 
were substrates for ToxA, whereas H-Ras, Rab5, and Arf1 were not glucosylated. 
ToxA-catalyzed glucosylation of lysates from ToxA-pretreated rat basophilic 
leukemia (RBL) cells resulted in a decreased incorporation of [14C]glucose, 
indicating previous glucosylation in the intact cell. Glucosylation of the Rho 
subtype proteins appears to be the molecular mechanism by which C. difficile 
ToxA mediates its cytotoxic effects on cells.

histamine.

Clostridium difficile toxin A (Tx-A) mediates secretion and inflammation in 
experimental enterocolitis. Intravital video microscopy was used to define the 
mechanisms that underlie the inflammatory reactions elicited by direct exposure 
of the microvasculature to Tx-A. Leukocyte adherence and emigration, 
leukocyte-platelet aggregation, and extravasation of FITC-albumin were monitored 
in rat mesenteric venules exposed to Tx-A. Significant increases in leukocyte 
adherence and emigration (LAE) and albumin leakage were noted within 15-30 min 
of Tx-A exposure. These responses were accompanied by mast cell degranulation 
and the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates. The Tx-A-induced increases 
in LAE and albumin leakage were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 
either monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the leukocyte adhesion 
glycoproteins, CD11/CD18, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and P-selectin (but 
not E-selectin) or with sialyl Lewis x, a counter-receptor for P-selectin. The 
mast cell stabilizer, lodoxamide, an H1- (but not an H2-) receptor antagonist, 
and diamine oxidase (histaminase) were also effective in reducing the LAE and 
albumin leakage elicited by Tx-A. The platelet-leukocyte aggregation response 
was blunted by an mAb against P-selectin, sialyl Lewis x, and the H1-receptor 
antagonist. These observations indicate that Tx-A induces a leukocyte-dependent 
leakage of albumin from postcapillary venules. Mast cell-derived histamine 
appears to mediate at least part of the leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and 
platelet-leukocyte aggregation by engaging H1-receptors on endothelial cells and 
platelets to increase the expression of P-selectin. The adhesion glycoproteins 
CD11/CD18 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 also contribute to the 
inflammatory responses elicited by toxin A.

The host cell chaperone Hsp90 is essential for translocation of the binary 
Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin into the cytosol.

Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is the prototype of the binary 
actin-ADP-ribosylating toxins and consists of the binding component C2II and the 
enzyme component C2I. The activated binding component C2IIa forms heptamers, 
which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme 
component C2I. This toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
In acidic endosomes, heptameric C2IIa forms pores and mediates the translocation 
of C2I into the cytosol. We report that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 90-specific 
inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of Vero cells, rat 
astrocytes, and HeLa cells by C2 toxin. ADP-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol 
of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active C2I was translocated into the 
cytosol after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Under control conditions, C2I was 
localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin 
blocked the cytosolic distribution of C2I. At low extracellular pH (pH 4.5), 
which allows the direct translocation of C2I via C2IIa heptamers across the cell 
membrane into the cytosol, Hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by C2I. 
Geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by 
C2IIa. The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of C2I was not affected by Hsp90 
inhibitors in vitro. The cytotoxic actions of the actin-ADP-ribosylating 
Clostridium perfringens iota toxin and the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C2-C3 fusion 
toxin was similarly blocked by Hsp90 inhibitors. In contrast, radicicol and 
geldanamycin had no effect on anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity of 
J774-A1 macrophage-like cells or on cytotoxic effects of the glucosylating 
Clostridium difficile toxin B in Vero cells. The data indicate that Hsp90 is 
essential for the membrane translocation of ADP-ribosylating toxins delivered by 
C2II.

Effects of Clostridium difficile toxin B on activation of rat peritoneal mast 
cells.

Freiburg, Germany.

Clostridium difficile toxin B that inactivates Rho subfamily proteins by 
glucosylation, inhibited dinitrophenyl-conjugated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) 
and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced mast cell activation by 80 to 
90% in a concentration- and time dependent manner with a delay of about 30 min. 
Activation of mast cells by compound 48/80 and calcium ionophore A23187 was 
maximally inhibited by about 50%. Inhibition by toxin B was observed with 
suspended, attached and permeabilised mast cells. C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase, 
which selectively inactivates RhoA,B,C subtype proteins inhibited antigen, 
compound 48/80, PMA, A23187 and GTP[S]-induced degranulation of permeabilised 
mast cells C3-induced inhibition of stimulated histamine release was smaller 
than that observed with toxin B and both inhibitory effects were not additive. 
These findings suggest the involvement of Rho subtype GTPases and additionally, 
of other members of the Rho subfamily GTPases in activation of rat peritoneal 
mast cells.

Nonspecific binding of Clostridium difficile toxin A to murine immunoglobulins 
occurs via the fab component.

Cooke DL(1), Borriello SP.

Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, United Kingdom.

Clostridium difficile toxin A binds nonspecifically to a mouse monoclonal 
antibody (MAb) immunoglobulin G3 lambda chain [IgG3(lambda)], through the Fab 
component. This binding, which is retained even after boiling the MAb, is 
temperature dependent, with more toxin bound at 4 than 37 degrees C (P = 
0.0024). The nonspecific binding was decreased by incubation of the IgG3 lambda 
MAb with alpha- or beta-galactosidase (P = 0.0001 and 0.029, respectively), 
indicating that toxin A binds to a carbohydrate moiety on the Fab. However, 
binding was not blocked by the Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin BS-1, indicating 
that a terminal alpha-galactose may not be involved. Binding was also not 
affected by competitive assays with Lewis X antigen. The dependence on 
carbohydrate moieties in nonspecific binding was also shown for two other MAbs, 
IgA(kappa) and IgM(lambda), with demonstration of a significant reduction in 
binding with alpha-galactosidase (P = 0.0001 and 0.0002, respectively) but not 
beta-galactosidase (P = 0.27 and 0.25, respectively).

hippocampal neurons.

Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA; 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-2,3-cyclic phosphate) is an 
analog of the growth factor-like phospholipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid 
(LPA). As brain tissue is the richest source of cPA we tested its effects on 
hippocampal neurons from day 16/17 embryonic rat cultured in a serum-free 
medium. Nanomolar concentrations of cPA elicited a neurotrophic effect and 
promoted neurite outgrowth that exceeded that of 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor 
(NGF). Pertussis toxin, the LPA1/LPA3 receptor-selective antagonist 
dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate, the myristoylated inhibitory pseudosubstrate 
peptide of protein kinase A (PKI), Wortmannin and PD98059 abolished the 
neurite-promoting effect. cPA elicited a sustained activation of extracellular 
signal-related kinases (ERK) 1/2 and Akt. Clostridium difficile toxin B, an 
inhibitor of the Rho family of GTPases, reduced cPA-induced enhancement of 
neurite outgrowth. In B5P cells, a clonal cell line of PC12 cells overexpressing 
tyrosine kinase NGF receptor (TrkA), cPA elicited transphosphorylation of TrkA. 
cPA-elicited ERK activation was blocked by K252a and PKI. These results suggest 
that cPA mimics the effects of, and activates signaling pathways similar to, the 
neurotrophin NGF in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons and B5P cells.

Involvement of Rho family G protein in the cell signaling for sperm 
incorporation during fertilization of mouse eggs: inhibition by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B.

Sperm-egg interaction was investigated in mouse eggs freed from the zona 
pellucida and injected with Clostridium difficile toxin B, the inhibitor of Rho 
family small G proteins. Toxin B reduced in a dose-dependent manner the 
percentage of eggs associated with sperm fusion on the surface or sperm nucleus 
decondensation in the ooplasm, examined by injection of a DNA-staining dye into 
the egg and transfer of the dye to the fused sperm head after recording 
intracellular Ca(2+) responses for 100 min postinsemination. The mean number of 
decondensed sperm nuclei per egg was remarkably decreased by approximately 1 
microg/ml toxin B in the ooplasm. This was because spermatozoa were arrested at 
the fusion state without developing to sperm incorporation and tended to lose 
cytoplasmic continuity to the egg. The fusion-arrested spermatozoa caused 
transient small Ca(2+) oscillations in most of eggs, while an injected 
spermatozoon produced repetitive large Ca(2+) spikes unaffected by toxin B. A 
decrease in the rate of fused spermatozoa and decondensed sperm nuclei was also 
caused by 20-40 microM cytochalasin D, the inhibitor of actin polymerization. 
Immunostaining of Rho proteins showed that Rac1 and RhoB are present in the 
cortical ooplasm, but Cdc42 is absent. Actin filaments in the cortex appeared to 
be reduced in toxin B-injected eggs. This study suggests that Rho protein(s) 
regulating actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization is involved in the process 
leading to sperm incorporation.

Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) belongs to the family of clostridial 
glucosylating toxins. TcsL exhibits glucosyltransferase activity to inactivate 
Rho and Ras proteins. On cultured cells, TcsL causes actin reorganization 
("cytopathic effect") and apoptotic cell death ("cytotoxic effect"). This study 
is based on the concept that the cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the 
glucosylation of critical substrate proteins rather than on the 
glucosyltransferase activity per se. The cytotoxic effects of TcsL depend on the 
glucosyltransferase activity of TcsL, as neither chemically inactivated TcsL nor 
a glucosyltransferase-deficient mutant version of TcsL caused it. The TcsL 
homologous toxin B from Clostridium difficile serotype F strain 1470 (TcdBF) 
also failed to cause cytotoxic effects. Correlation of the toxins' respective 
protein substrate specificities highlighted (H/K/N)Ras as critical substrate 
proteins for the cytotoxic effects. (H/K/N)Ras are critical upstream regulators 
of phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival signaling. 
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) classified to activate PI3K/Akt signaling 
downstream of apoptosis-inducing stimuli prevented the cytotoxic effects of 
TcsL. In conclusion, (H/K/N)Ras glucosylation and subsequent inhibition of 
PI3K/Akt signaling are critical for the cytotoxic effects of TcsL.

The low molecular mass GTP-binding protein Rho is affected by toxin A from 
Clostridium difficile.

(1)Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Universität des Saarlandes, 
Homburg, Germany.

Enterotoxin A is one of the major virulence factors of Clostridium difficile, 
and the causative agent of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In 
cell culture (NIH-3T3, rat basophilic leukemia cells) toxin A inhibits 
Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 (C3)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation 
of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Rho participates in the 
regulation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. Decrease in ADP-ribosylation of 
Rho occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and precedes the toxin 
A-induced destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Action of toxin A is not due to 
proteolytical degradation of Rho or to an inherent ADP-ribosyltransferase 
activity of toxin A. Toxin A-induced decrease in ADP-ribosylation is observed 
also in cell lysates and with recombinant RhoA protein. A heat stable low 
molecular mass cytosolic factor is essential for the toxin effect on Rho. Thus, 
the enterotoxin (toxin A) resembles the effects of the C. difficile cytotoxin 
(toxin B) on Rho proteins (Just, I., G. Fritz, K. Aktories, M. Giry, M. R. 
Popoff, P. Boquet, S. Hegenbath, and C. Von Eichel-Streiber. 1994. J. Biol. 
Chem. 269:10706-10712). The data indicate that despite different in vivo 
effects, toxin A and toxin B act on the same cellular target protein Rho to 
elicit their toxic effects.

This study was aimed at seeking strains of Clostridium difficile in feces and 
investigation of influence of antibiotics application on frequency of isolation 
and detection of toxing in vivo produced by this microorganism. Samples of feces 
were obtained from experimental dogs consisting of two groups. To groups I 
belonged 150 healthy dogs. Group II consisted of samples of feces received from 
four dogs before and after application of various antibiotics. Clostridium 
difficile was not isolated from group I dogs. From dogs belonging to group II, 
28 strains were isolated. Production of toxing and classification to serological 
groups of the isolated strains were performed. Presence of this microorganism in 
feces of dogs is evident only after multiple application of antibiotics. Results 
of these studies suggest that dogs may constitute a reservoir of Clostridium 
difficile.

Previously we reported that pretreatment of rats with the substance P (SP) 
antagonist CP-96,345 inhibits the enterotoxic responses following administration 
of toxin A from Clostridium difficile into ileal loops, indicating that SP 
participates in the intestinal responses to this toxin. We now report that 
injection of toxin A into rat ileum causes a rapid increase in SP content in 
lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and mucosal scrapings 30-60 min after toxin A 
administration. Toxin A-mediated fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, and 
ileal histologic damage is significantly increased only after 2 hr. Toxin A also 
causes an increase in the abundance of SP mRNA in lumbar DRG and ileal mucosa as 
measured by reverse transcription-PCR. Lamina propria macrophages (LPMs) 
obtained from toxin A-injected loops release greater amounts of tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFalpha) and SP as compared with LPMs isolated from 
buffer-injected loops (P < 0.01). Pretreatment of rats with the SP antagonist 
CP-96,345 inhibits toxin A-mediated TNFalpha release from isolated LPMs, whereas 
an inactive enantiomer (CP-96,344) of the SP antagonist has no effect. LPMs 
obtained from toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with SP (10(-8) to 
10(-9) M) show enhanced TNFalpha secretion, whereas LPMs isolated from 
buffer-injected loops do not respond to SP. In addition, LPMs obtained from 
toxin A-injected ileal loops incubated in vitro with CP-96,345 showed a 
diminished TNFalpha release. Our results indicate that activated LPMs secrete SP 
during toxin A enteritis that can lead to secretion of cytokines, suggesting an 
autocrine/paracrine regulation of cytokine secretion by SP from LPMs during 
intestinal inflammation.

Involvement of enteric nerves in permeability changes due to deoxycholic acid in 
rat jejunum in vivo.

Fihn BM(1), Sjöqvist A, Jodal M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Physiology, University of Göteborg, Göteborg, Sweden.

AIM: Stress and Clostridium difficile toxin A increase epithelial permeability 
in the small intestine via vagus and visceral afferents, in turn activating 
mucosal mast cells. Bile acids also increase epithelial permeability but it is 
not known if nerves or mast cells are involved in this effect in the small 
intestine.
METHOD: In jejunum of anesthetized rats, the effects of hexamethonium and 
atropine on deoxycholic acid (DCA) induced fluid secretion and increase in 
epithelial permeability was therefore studied by determining the appearance and 
disappearance rates of 14C-mannitol and 51Cr-EDTA into and from a perfusion 
system containing 4 or 8 mm DCA and expressed as clearance.
RESULTS: DCA increased net fluid transport and appearance and to a less extent 
disappearance rates of the probes. Hexamethonium but not atropine, chronic 
denervation or the NO synthase inhibitor L-NNA did significantly decrease the 
appearance rate and net fluid secretion. The levels of the mast cell protease II 
(RMCP II) in perfusate and plasma were not increased by DCA. The clearance ratio 
Cr-EDTA/mannitol indicates that the plasma clearance of the permeability probes 
is partly secondary to net fluid transport only at higher DCA concentrations.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the DCA effect on epithelial permeability is to a 
large part induced by intramural reflex(es) containing nicotinic receptors. The 
results also suggest that mast cell degranulation and NO release are not 
involved in the mechanism. This indicates that the nerve effect on intestinal 
paracellular permeability is not mediated by the mechanisms described for stress 
or Clostridium difficile toxin A.

Immunochemical and structural similarities in toxin A and toxin B of Clostridium 
difficile shown by binding to monoclonal antibodies.

Washington, DC 20307-5100.

Clostridium difficile toxins A and B were shown to share immunochemical and 
structural features, including shared sequential epitopes. Nineteen hybridomas 
generated after immunization of mice with a mixture of toxoids produced 
monoclonal antibodies, all IgM(x), which bound to toxin A and toxin B in a 
solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA). None of the antibodies neutralized the 
cytotoxicity of either toxin, alone or in pairs, nor did they neutralize mouse 
lethality. The antibodies did not inhibit hemagglutination by toxin A, and none 
of those tested neutralized the toxin's enterotoxic activity. Studies of binding 
of antibodies to native toxins in the RIA showed that the antibodies differed in 
their recognition of the toxins. Many of the antibodies bound with higher 
avidity to toxin A than to toxin B. In Western blots, all the antibodies 
recognized both toxins in the native state; in addition, some antibodies 
recognized the minor cytotoxic species of toxin B. When the toxins were 
denatured and reduced, five antibodies bound to both toxins, five to A only, and 
nine to neither, demonstrating that the antibodies had different epitope 
specificities. Further structural comparisons were made by investigation of mol. 
wts, subunit structures and amino acid compositions. The native mol. wts of 
toxin A and toxin B, as determined by electrophoresis to equilibrium in 4-30% 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), were 430,000 and 368,000, 
respectively. Denatured and reduced toxins each had a single subunit of 315,000. 
Both toxins had about 50% hydrophobic amino acids.

The incidence of non-thermophilic Campylobacter species was assessed in an 
unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in North 
Jutland, Denmark. In a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 
patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter 
method. We recovered a high incidence of Campylobacter concisus (annual 
incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common Campylobacter 
jejuni/coli. In contrast, there was a very low incidence of other 
non-thermophilic Campylobacter species, such as Campylobacter upsaliensis. 
Campylobacter concisus was, unlike C. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among 
small children (<1 year) and the elderly (≥ 65 years). Around 10% of the 
patients with C. consisus had co-infections dominated by Clostridium difficile 
and Salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of C. 
jejuni/coli patients. We observed a seasonal variation in C. jejuni/coli with a 
peak incidence in late summer months and autumn, whereas there was an almost 
constant monthly prevalence of C. concisus. Among patients participating in a 
questionnaire sub-study, there was a higher degree of close contacts with 
animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among C. 
jejuni/coli patients compared with C. concisus patients. We did not culture any 
C. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. Future 
studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of 
inflammatory bowel diseases in C. concisus-positive patients. We conclude that 
there is a high incidence of C. concisus in Denmark.

Enteritis is a potential complication of antimicrobial agent use, particularly 
in certain species of rodents. The organism most frequently implicated in this 
disease is Clostridium difficile. Anecdotal information suggests that 
administration of yogurt or other Lactobacillus-containing products in 
conjunction with antimicrobial agents will prevent or minimize the effects of 
antibiotic-associated enteritis. We wanted to determine whether a single 
subcutaneous injection of clindamycin phosphate could induce enteritis in guinea 
pigs and whether a commercial Lactobacillus preparation would ameliorate the 
clinical effects of antibiotic administration in these animals. Juvenile male 
guinea pigs were divided into three treatment groups. Group 1 guinea pigs (n=8) 
received a single saline injection followed by an oral Lactobacillus preparation 
twice daily; group 2 (n=8) received a single antibiotic injection followed by an 
oral Lactobacillus preparation twice daily; group 3 (n=8) received a single 
antibiotic injection. Attitude, body temperature, body weight, and feed and 
water consumption were recorded for each guinea pig 7 days prior to and after 
treatment. Fecal samples were collected and necropsies performed on each guinea 
pig at the time of euthanasia. C. difficile and other enteric pathogens were not 
isolated from any group before or after treatment, although some guinea pigs 
receiving the antibiotic developed enteritis. There were no significant clinical 
differences between guinea pigs receiving antibiotics with the oral 
Lactobacillus preparation, and those receiving antibiotics alone. The results of 
this study suggest that a single injection of clindamycin phosphate can induce 
enteritis in guinea pigs and that oral administration of a 
Lactobacillus-containing product is ineffective in preventing clinical disease 
in guinea pigs administered clindamycin phosphate.

Presence of fructokinase in pancreatic islets.

Homogenates of rat pancreatic islets that had been heated for 5 min at 70 
degrees C to inactive hexokinases, catalyzed the ATP-dependent phosphorylation 
of D-fructose. This reaction was dependent on the presence of K+ and was 
inhibited by D-tagatose although not by D-glucose or D-glucose 6-phosphate. The 
phosphorylation product was identified as fructose 1-phosphate through its 
conversion to a bisphosphate ester by Clostridium difficile fructose 1-phosphate 
kinase. These findings allowed the conclusion that fructokinase (ketohexokinase) 
was responsible for this process. Similar results were observed with tumoral 
insulin-producing cells (RINm5F line). Fructokinase may account for a large 
share of fructose phosphorylation in intact islets, particularly in the presence 
of D-glucose.

Prairie dog model for antimicrobial agent-induced Clostridium difficile 
diarrhea.

Muller EL, Pitt HA, George WL.

We have noted that prairie dogs given cefoxitin develop diarrhea and lose weight 
yet survive for periods of up to 4 weeks. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis 
that cefoxitin causes Clostridium difficile cecitis in prairie dogs. Six prairie 
dogs were given a single intramuscular dose of 100 mg of cefoxitin per kg of 
body weight, and six control animals received saline; both groups were 
sacrificed 1 week later. Controls had no diarrhea and lost 2% of their body 
weight, whereas cefoxitin-treated animals had diarrhea (P less than 0.001) and 
lost 16% of their body weight (P less than 0.001); one animals died 6 days after 
cefoxitin challenge. None of the controls yielded C. difficile or had cecal 
cytotoxin or pseudomembranes detected. Cecal contents from all cefoxitin-treated 
animals, however, yielded C. difficile (P less than 0.01) and had cecal 
cytotoxin present (P less than 0.01). Four of five surviving animals also had 
cecal pseudomembranes present (P less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that 
in prairie dogs cefoxitin induces C. difficile cecitis. We conclude that the 
prairie dog is another model for the study of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. The 
disease in prairie dogs may have a more chronic course than in other animal 
models of C. difficile-induced diarrhea and may be useful as a model for 
studying certain aspects of C. difficile-induced diarrhea.

Rescue of auditory hair cells from aminoglycoside toxicity by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho/Rac/Cdc42.

The hair cells (HCs) are the most vulnerable elements in the cochlea and damage 
to them is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Understanding 
the intracellular events that lead to the death of HCs is a key to developing 
protective strategies. Recently, it has been shown that the c-Jun-N-terminal 
kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in HCs in response to aminoglycosides (J. 
Neurosci. 20 (2000) 43). We have studied the upstream events leading to JNK 
activation in aminoglycoside toxicity in vitro. The small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 
are well known upstream activators of JNK in other cell types. Clostridium 
difficile toxin B monoglucosylates all members of the Rho GTPase subfamily (Rho, 
Rac and Cdc42 isoforms) and inhibits GTP binding by steric interference (Nature 
341 (1989) 209). Organ of Corti explants from p5 rat basal turns were maintained 
in tissue culture and treated with C. difficile toxin B for 12 h. They were then 
treated with toxin B plus gentamicin for 72 h. Significantly less HC death was 
observed compared to with gentamicin alone. Toxin B alone had no effect on HCs 
at the highest concentration used. Using antibodies against phospho-c-Jun, we 
observed background immunoreactivity in control explants, strong staining of 
outer hair cell nuclei in gentamicin treated explants, and weaker immunostaining 
in explants treated with gentamicin and C. difficile toxin B. We conclude that 
Rho family small GTPases play a role in aminoglycoside toxicity signaling as 
upstream activators of the JNK signaling pathway.

[Response of the IRD intestinal epithelial cell line to Clostridium difficile 
toxins A and B in rats. Effect of Saccharomyces boulardii].

[Article in French]

In vivo, Clostridium difficile acts by releasing 2 toxins: toxin A, an 
enterotoxin, and toxin B, a cytotoxin. This study was performed to determine: a) 
whether the rat epithelial intestinal cell line IRD 98 responds to Clostridium 
difficile toxin A and B; b) whether the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii has an 
effect on this model. Evaluation of 3H-thymidine incorporation into IRD 98 cells 
exposed to toxin B revealed that DNA synthesis was inhibited for low 
concentrations (10 ng/ml). For higher concentrations, DNA synthesis was not 
modified. Evaluation of 14C-leucine incorporation into IRD 98 cells exposed to 
toxin B revealed that this toxin affected protein synthesis. Whereas cholera 
toxin stimulates adenylate cyclase in IRD 98 cells, cAMP levels in cells exposed 
to various quantities of toxin A was similar to that in control cells. As 
opposed to cholera toxin, which does not affect the cytoskeletal structure of 
IRD 98 cells, 7 micrograms/ml of toxin A and even smaller amounts of toxin B (1 
ng/ml) were found to cause structural alterations by immunofluorescence studies. 
Prior exposition of cells to Saccharomyces boulardii reduced or prevented the 
rounding of cells in the presence of these toxins. IRD 98 cells can thus be 
considered a good model for in vitro investigation of the effects of Clostridium 
difficile toxins A and B, and findings suggest that Saccharomyces boulardii has 
a protective effect against the action of these toxins.

Prevention of clindamycin-induced colitis in hamsters by Clostridium sordellii 
antitoxin.

Allo M, Silva J Jr, Fekety R, Rifkin GD, Waskin H.

Toxins produced by Clostridium difficile have been implicated in the etiology of 
antibiotic-induced colitis. Clostridium difficile antitoxin is not available, 
but recent studies have shown that toxins present in the feces of patients with 
this disease are neutralized by Clostridium sordellii antitoxin. We found that 
C. sordellii antitoxin neutralized toxins produced in broth cultures of either 
C. sordellii or C. difficile and that passive immunization with C. sordellii 
antitoxin before challenge with clindamycin prevented colitis in hamsters. 
Significantly fewer antitoxin-treated animals than unimmunized controls 
developed diarrhea and died with hemorrhagic colitis. Administration of 300 U of 
antitoxin parenterally either on the day of challenge with clindamycin or 24 hr 
later provided significant protection (25% mortality vs. 100% mortality in 
controls, P less than 0.01). None of eight animals given antitoxin (300 U) both 
on the day of challenge and 24 hr later died. Filtrates prepared from cecal 
contents of dead or killed hamsters were tested for toxicity by intraperitoneal 
injection into hamsters and by addition to monolayers of monkey kidney cells. 
Fecal filtrates from antitoxin-protected animals were not toxic in these assays, 
but filtrates from control animals were uniformly toxic. Passive immunization 
against clostridial toxins was protective against clindamycin-associated colitis 
in this model. This finding further substantiates the importance of these toxins 
in the pathogenesis of antibiotic-induced colitis.

Role of Rho proteins in carbachol-induced contractions in intact and 
permeabilized guinea-pig intestinal smooth muscle.

1. The aim of this study was to determine whether the low molecular mass GTPase 
RhoA or related proteins are involved in carbachol- and high-K(+)-induced 
contractions in intact intestinal smooth muscle as well as the carbachol-induced 
increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments in permeabilized preparations. 
2. The carbachol-induced increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force production in 
beta-escin-permeabilized intestinal smooth muscle was enhanced in preparations 
that were loaded with the constitutively active mutant of RhoA, Val14RhoA, and 
was inhibited by exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum, which ADP-ribosylates 
and inactivates small GTPases of the Rho family. The effect of C3 on Ca2+ 
sensitivity in the absence of the agonist was negligible, while the maximal 
Ca(2+)-activated force was inhibited by about 20%. 3. Inhibition of 
carbachol-induced force was associated with an increase in ADP-ribosylation of a 
protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 22 kDa, corresponding to 
Rho, and was partially reversed in the presence of Ile41RhoA, which is not a 
substrate for C3. Val14RhoA did not restore carbachol-induced Ca2+ sensitization 
in C3-treated smooth muscle. 4. In intact intestinal smooth muscle, toxin B from 
Clostridium difficile, which monoglucosylates members of the Rho family, 
inhibited high-K(+)-induced contractions and the initial phasic response to 
carbachol by about 30%. The delayed contractile response to carbachol was 
completely inhibited. 5. In smooth muscle preparations that were permeabilized 
with beta-escin after treatment with toxin B, carbachol-and GTP gamma S-induced 
Ca2+ sensitization was significantly inhibited. 6. These findings are consistent 
with a role for Rho or Rho-like proteins in agonist-induced increase in Ca2+ 
sensitivity of force production in intact and permeabilized intestinal smooth 
muscle.

Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis requires CDC42 and Rac1.

At the surface of phagocytes, antibody-opsonized particles are recognized by 
surface receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (FcRs) that mediate 
their capture by an actin-driven process called phagocytosis which is poorly 
defined. We have analyzed the function of the Rho proteins Rac1 and CDC42 in the 
high affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI)-mediated phagocytosis using 
transfected rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells expressing dominant 
inhibitory forms of CDC42 and Rac1. Binding of opsonized particles to 
untransfected RBL-2H3 cells led to the accumulation of F-actin at the site of 
contact with the particles and further, to particle internalization. This 
process was inhibited by Clostridium difficile toxin B, a general inhibitor of 
Rho GTP-binding proteins. Dominant inhibition of Rac1 or CDC42 function severely 
inhibited particle internalization but not F-actin accumulation. Inhibition of 
CDC42 function resulted in the appearance of pedestal-like structures with 
particles at their tips, while particles bound at the surface of the Rac1 mutant 
cell line were enclosed within thin membrane protrusions that did not fuse. 
These phenotypic differences indicate that Rac1 and CDC42 have distinct 
functions and may act cooperatively in the assembly of the phagocytic cup. 
Inhibition of phagocytosis in the mutant cell lines was accompanied by the 
persistence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins around bound particles. 
Phagocytic cup closure and particle internalization were also blocked when 
phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation was inhibited by treatment of RBL-2H3 cells 
with phenylarsine oxide, an inhibitor of protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases. 
Altogether, our data show that Rac1 and CDC42 are required to coordinate actin 
filament organization and membrane extension to form phagocytic cups and to 
allow particle internalization during FcR-mediated phagocytosis. Our data also 
suggest that Rac1 and CDC42 are involved in phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation 
required for particle internalization.

Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) released at local sites 
of inflammation promotes inflammation in the periphery. We investigated its 
effects in the intestinal responses caused by toxin A from Clostridium 
difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-associated colitis.
METHODS: Ileal loops were injected with 10 microg of toxin A, and enterotoxic 
responses were measured at various time points.
RESULTS: Pretreatment of mice with 2.5 microg/kg of the CRH receptor antagonist 
alpha-helical CRH((9-41)) that blocks both CRH receptor subtypes reduced toxin 
A-mediated ileal secretion, epithelial cell damage, mucosal edema, neutrophil 
infiltration, and mucosal content of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha. Pretreatment with the specific CRH(1) receptor antagonist 
antalarmin (20 mg/kg, IP) also inhibited toxin A-induced fluid secretion and 
toxin A-associated histologic changes. CRH messenger RNA and protein were 
increased in mouse ileum 30 minutes after intraluminal toxin A administration. 
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that toxin A at 1 
hour caused a substantial increase in the expression of both CRH receptor 
subtypes in the ileal mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral CRH may play a proinflammatory role in toxin A-induced 
intestinal secretion and inflammation and that CRH(1) receptor, at least in 
part, is important in the mediation of these responses.

Production, purification and characterization of Clostridium difficile toxic 
proteins different from toxin A and from toxin B.

Torres JF(1), Lönnroth I.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medical Microbiology, Gothenburgh University, Göteborg Sweden.

The purification and characterization of three new proteins called C1, C2, and 
C3 from Clostridium difficile are described. Their estimated molecular mass were 
about 350 (C1), 270 (C2) and 140 (C3) kDa, consisting of subunits of 39 (C1), 43 
(C2) and 41 (C3) kDa, respectively. Immunodiffusion revealed that the three 
proteins contained similar but not identical antigenic determinants to toxin A. 
Each protein induced a cytotonic effect on hamster ovaric cells; the combined 
proteins, had a specific activity on cells 5-times higher than that of toxin A. 
In rat intestinal loops, they induced a clear fluid secretion, while toxin A 
elicited a haemorrhagic fluid response. The cytotonic activities of all three 
proteins were abolished by antiserum against toxin A, while antiserum against 
toxin B inhibited only the activity of the 270 kDa protein. In contrast to toxin 
A, the cytotoxicity of the three proteins was inactivated by trypsin. Thus, the 
chemical, antigenic and biological properties of these proteins differed from 
those of toxin A and toxin B.

Recombinant single-chain variable fragment antibodies directed against 
Clostridium difficile toxin B produced by use of an optimized phage display 
system.

(1)Department of Cell Biology and Biochemistry, Texas Tech University Health 
Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas 79430, USA.

Recombinant antibody cloning and phage display technologies were used to produce 
single-chain antibodies (scFv) against Clostridium difficile toxin B. The 
starting material was the mouse B cell hybridoma line 5A8, which generates a 
monoclonal antibody against the toxin. The integrated cloning, screening, and 
phage display system of Krebber et al. (J. Immunol. Methods 201:35-55, 1997) 
allowed us to rapidly obtain toxin B-binding scFv sequences derived from the 
hybridoma cell line. The best candidate scFv sequences, based on preliminary 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening data were then subcloned 
into the compatible expression vector. Recombinant single-chain antibodies were 
expressed in Escherichia coli. A 29-kDa band was observed on polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis as predicted. The expressed product was characterized by 
immunoblotting and detection with an anti-FLAG antibody. The toxin B-binding 
function of the single-chain antibody was shown by a sandwich ELISA. The 
antibody was highly specific for toxin B and did not cross-react with material 
isolated from a toxin B-negative C. difficile strain. The sensitivity of the 
soluble single-chain antibody is significantly higher than the original 
monoclonal antibody based on ELISA data and could detect a minimum of 10 ng of 
toxin B/well. Competitive ELISAs established that the affinity of the 5A8 parent 
antibody and the best representative (clone 10) of the single-chain antibodies 
were similar and in the range of 10(-8) M. We propose that recombinant antibody 
technology is a rapid and effective approach to the development of the next 
generation of immunodiagnostic reagents.

Thirty stool filtrates known to contain Clostridium difficile toxin based on 
previous testing on McCoy cells were tested for toxicity on primary African 
green monkey kidney (AGMK), McCoy, MRC-5, primary rhesus monkey kidney (RMK), 
and Vero cells. All 30 filtrates showed cytotoxic effect at greater than or 
equal to 1:100 dilution on McCoy and Vero cells. A total of 22 filtrates were 
positive on MRC-5 monolayers, while only 16 and 10 filtrates showed positive 
cytotoxic effect on AGMK and RMK cells, respectively. Another 630 stool 
specimens were tested on McCoy and Vero cells only. Of these stool filtrates, 70 
were positive and 560 were negative with both cell lines, which thus gave 100% 
agreement. Vero cells can be used interchangeably with McCoy cells for the 
detection of C. difficile toxin in stool filtrates.

The intestinal effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A are inidated by toxin 
binding to luminal enterocyte receptors. We reported previously that the rabbit 
ileal brush border (BB) receptor is a glycoprotein with an alpha-d-galactose 
containing trisaccharide in the toxin-binding domain (1991. J. Clin. Invest. 
88:119-125). In this study we characterized the rabbit ileal BB receptor for 
this toxin. Purified toxin receptor peptides of 19 and 24 amino acids showed 
100% homology with rabbit sucrase-isomaltase (SI). Guinea pig receptor antiserum 
reacted in Western blots with rabbit SI and with the purified toxin receptor. 
Antireceptor IgG blocked in vitro binding of toxin A to rabbit ileal villus cell 
BB. Furthermore, anti-SI IgG inhibited toxin A-induced secretion (by 78.1%, P < 
0.01), intestinal permeability (by 80.8%, P < 0.01), and histologic injury (P < 
0.01) in rabbit ileal loops in vivo. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected 
with SI cDNA showed increased intracellular calcium increase in response to 
native toxin (holotoxin) or to a recombinant 873-amino acid peptide representing 
the receptor binding domain of toxin A. These data suggest that toxin A binds 
specifically to carbohydrate domains on rabbit ileal SI, and that such binding 
is relevant to signal transduction mechanisms that mediate in vitro and in vivo 
toxicity.

Detection of Clostridium difficile Toxin A by immunoblotting.

Rautenberg P, Stender F, Ullmann U.

A clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile has been tested for its toxin 
production. Both toxins, toxin A and toxin B, could be detected by tissue 
culture and in animal models as well. Antibodies against a crude toxin A 
preparation have been prepared. These antibodies are able to neutralize the 
toxin both in the mouse lethality test and tissue culture test systems. The 
specificity of this antiserum has been analysed by electroimmunoprecipitation 
methods. Using immunoblotting, it could be demonstrated that the antigenicity of 
toxin A after SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and 
reducing conditions was still preserved. The molecular weight of toxin A has 
been estimated to be 250000. Immunoblotting offers a simple and reliable 
procedure for toxin A detection from culture supernatants of C. difficile.

The association between RhoB and caspase-2: changes with lovastatin-induced 
apoptosis.

Kong JY(1), Rabkin SW.

BCV5Z 3J5, Canada.

Because cytoskeletal actin is regulated, in part, by Rho, and because Rho and 
caspases are involved in apoptosis, we sought to determine whether there was an 
association between RhoB and caspase-2. A RhoB-caspase-2 association was 
consistently demonstrated in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes with Western 
Blotting, either after immunoprecipitation with RhoB followed by immunoblotting 
with caspase-2, or in reciprocal experiments after immuno precipitation with 
caspase-2 and immunoblotting with RhoB (n = 14). Although the RhoB-caspase-2 
complex was constitutively present, the link between RhoB and caspase-2 may be 
operative in apoptosis because the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin 
increased the RhoB-caspase complex, especially in the nuclear fraction of the 
cell, with a peak occurrence 2 h after treatment. This association was 
unaffected by the caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVAD. Lovastatin produced apoptosis that 
was accompanied by an activation of caspase-2, as demonstrated by its 
immunohistochemistry and by the fact that the caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVAD reduced 
lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Lovastatin induced dramatic changes in cell 
morphology and a reduction in F-actin. Immunoblotting for actin suggests that 
lovastatin does not induce a degradation of the actin molecule, but rather 
affects filamentous F-actin. Caspase-2 inhibition with zVDVAD reduced 
lovastatin-induced alteration in cytoskeletal F-actin. The Rho inhibitor, 
Clostridium difficile toxin B, blunted the ability of lovastatin to induce 
apoptosis. In summary, these data show a previously unrecognized association 
between RhoB and caspase-2 in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, which has 
ramifications for processes regulated by RhoB and caspase-2, including 
apoptosis.

Interaction of cytopathogenic toxin from Clostridium difficile with cells in 
tissue culture.

Thelestam M, Brönnegård M.

Partially purified cytopathogenic toxin from Clostridium difficile induced 
morphological changes in five cell lines in tissue culture. The relative 
sensitivity scale of the cell lines was human lung and intestinal fibroblasts 
greater than Chinese hamster ovary cells much greater than mouse adrenal cells 
greater than mouse neuroblastoma cells. The cytopathogenic effect did not occur 
in toxin-treated lung fibroblasts incubated at 0 degree C. Pre-incubation of 
lung fibroblasts with 2,4-dinitrophenol prevented the cytopathogenic effect. The 
toxin bound to as yet unidentified receptors at the surface of human lung and 
intestinal fibroblasts. The toxin-induced morphological (actinomorphic) changes 
in lung and intestinal fibroblasts closely resembled the effects induced by the 
fungal metabolite cytochalasin B (CB), which is known to disrupt microfilaments 
reversibly. Indirect immunofluorescence with anti-actin antiserum demonstrated 
that the C. difficile toxin disrupted the straight actin filament bundles seen 
in normal fibroblasts. The cytopathogenic effect became apparent 3--5 h after 
exposure to toxin. However, irreversible intoxication occurred already within 20 
min of exposure, as toxin-treated fibroblasts which were trypsinized and 
reseeded were not able to attach to the solid substratum and regenerate their 
typical shape, a process requiring reorganization of actin into microfilament 
bundles. Two possible different modes of action of the toxin, leading to 
microfilament disruption, are suggested: 1) Transmembrane signal by 
surface-bound toxin via microfilament-linked integral membrane protein(s) and 2) 
Penetration of surface-bound whole toxin or an active fragment, followed by its 
intracellular action. The experimental evidence so far is consistent with either 
of these mechanisms.

Activation of astroglial phospholipase D activity by phorbol ester involves ARF 
and Rho proteins.

Primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes express phospholipase D (PLD) 
isoforms 1 and 2 as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Basal PLD activity 
was strongly (10-fold) increased by 4beta-phorbol-12beta,13alpha-dibutyrate 
(PDB) (EC(50): 56 nM), an effect which was inhibited by Ro 31-8220 (0.1-1 
microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), and by brefeldin A (10-100 
microg/ml), an inhibitor of ADP-ribosylating factor (ARF) activation. 
Pretreatment of the cultures with Clostridium difficile toxin B-10463 (0.1-1 
ng/ml), which inactivates small G proteins of the Rho family, led to a breakdown 
of the astroglial cytoskeleton; concomitantly, PLD activation by PDB was reduced 
by up to 50%. In contrast, inactivation of proteins of the Ras family by 
Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin 1522 did not affect PLD activation. In 
parallel experiments, serum-induced PLD activation was sensitive to brefeldin A, 
but not to Ro 31-8220 and not to clostridial toxins. We conclude that, in 
astrocytes, the PLD isoform which is activated by phorbol ester requires PKC, 
ARF and Rho proteins for full activity and probably represents PLD1.

Assessment of the potential risk of infection associated with Clostridium 
difficile from porcine xenografts.

University, UK.

There are numerous concerns over the potential for transfer of pathogens between 
species during clinical xenotransplantation, and although current clinical 
application is limited, porcine xenografts have been previously used to treat 
patients with severe burns. Donor animals providing the xenografts are sourced 
from a healthy commercial herd, however, as pigs are a known source of zoonotic 
agents, a number of diseases are required to be excluded from pigs used for 
xenotransplantation purposes. Many studies have indicated the relevance of viral 
zoonoses, however, little has been done with regard to the potential for 
transfer of pathogens related to health care associated infections. Clostridium 
difficile is a major cause of neonatal enteritis in pigs and an important 
feature of this organism is that pigs can be asymptomatic carriers. This study 
has examined the incidence of C. difficile PCR ribotypes present in healthy 
donor pigs to determine if pig faeces, and in particular, contamination of skin 
with faecal matter, is a potential route for the transfer of C. difficile. 
Animals were found to have human ribotype 017 present in the faecal matter, 
however, no C. difficile was isolated from skin samples taken from the same 
animals. In addition, due to the risk factors associated with C. difficile 
infection, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the C. difficile isolates has 
been determined.

Evolution of the caecal epithelial barrier during Clostridium difficile 
infection in the mouse.

The most striking effect of Clostridium difficile infection is its degrading of 
the intestinal barrier. The aim of this study is to establish whether the 
cellular or paracellular constituent of the barrier is the initial target of the 
toxins produced by C difficile. Accordingly, the caecal epithelium of C3H/He 
mice was challenged under three experimental conditions with the C difficile 
strain VPI 10463: (1) by in vivo inoculation of axenic mice, (2) by adding the 
toxins to ligated caeca in vivo, and (3) by adding them to the mucosal side of 
isolated caeca in Ussing chambers. Under all three conditions, the epithelial 
barrier was tested in caeca mounted in these chambers. The transepithelial 
potential difference (PD), electrical conductance (G), and intact and degraded 
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fluxes were used as indexes of permeability. 
Results were as follows: (1) In axenic mice, C difficile caused severe 
infection, produced toxins A and B, reduced PD, and enhanced G and intact HRP 
fluxes without changing degraded HRP fluxes, (2) four hours after the toxins 
were added to ligated caeca in vivo, PD was relatively unaltered, but G, and 
intact and degraded HRP fluxes increased, and (3) when toxins were added to 
caeca during two hours in the Ussing chambers, the only modification observed 
was an increase in degraded-HRP fluxes. These results indicate that the C 
difficile toxins gradually cause intestinal lesions. After an apparent 
resistance, they stimulate the endocytotic process and then increase 
paracellular permeability and finally cause loss of cell viability.

Quantitative assay for acute intestinal inflammation based on myeloperoxidase 
activity. Assessment of inflammation in rat and hamster models.

Krawisz JE, Sharon P, Stenson WF.

An assay was devised to quantitate acute intestinal inflammation based on the 
assessment of myeloperoxidase activity. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme found in 
neutrophils and, in much smaller quantities, in monocytes and macrophages. 
Myeloperoxidase was solubilized with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and 
myeloperoxidase activity was measured with a dianisidine-H2O2 assay. In 
neutrophil suspensions, myeloperoxidase activity was directly related to cell 
number down to as few as 500 cells. Myeloperoxidase activity was assayed in two 
animal models of inflammation: acetic acid-induced colitis in rats and 
Clostridium difficile enterotoxin-induced enteritis in hamsters. In both models, 
the activity of myeloperoxidase solubilized from the inflamed tissue was 
directly proportional to the number of neutrophils seen in histologic sections. 
Histologic evaluation of neutrophil accumulation was performed by counting the 
number of neutrophils in a histologic section 0.18 mm long and 5 micron thick. 
In both animal models, myeloperoxidase activity was linearly related to 
neutrophil number from 400 and 4000 cells/mm. Myeloperoxidase activity from 
chronically inflamed colon, in which both neutrophils and histiocytes were 
present, was directly related to neutrophil content. Histiocytes did not 
contribute significantly to myeloperoxidase activity. The determination of 
myeloperoxidase activity in the intestine is a simple biochemical assay that can 
be used to quantitate inflammation.

RhoB is the only member of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases, which is 
classified as an immediate early gene product. RhoB is up-regulated in response 
to growth factors as well as cytotoxic and genotoxic agents. Clostridial 
glucosylating toxins have been reported to evoke pronounced RhoB expression, 
based on the inactivation of Rho/Ras proteins. In this study, we report on a 
long lasting expression of RhoB in cultured cells upon activation of Rho 
proteins by the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli. The 
observations of this study highlight a new pathway involving Rac1, which 
positively regulates the activity of the rhoB promoter and RhoB expression. 
Conversely, the isomeric cytotoxic necrotizing factor from Yersinia 
pseudotuberculosis (CNFy) drives GTP-loading of basal RhoB but fails to cause 
activation of the rhoB promoter and thus its expression. CNF1 inhibits 
cytokinesis and induces the formation of bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells. Upon 
long term treatment with CNF1, RhoB(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
exhibit DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and loss of membrane 
integrity, while RhoB(+/-) MEFs persist as bi-nucleated (tetraploid) cells 
without any signs of cell death. In conclusion, the cytoprotective RhoB response 
is not only evoked by bacterial protein toxins inactivating Rho/Ras proteins but 
also by the Rac1-activating toxin CNF1.

Cell surface binding site for Clostridium difficile enterotoxin: evidence for a 
glycoconjugate containing the sequence Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc.

Krivan HC, Clark GF, Smith DF, Wilkins TD.

This study was undertaken to determine whether a binding site for Clostridium 
difficile enterotoxin (toxin A) exists in the brush border membranes (BBMs) of 
the hamster, an animal known to be extremely sensitive to the action of the 
toxin. Toxin A was the only antigen adsorbed by the BBMs from the culture 
filtrate of C. difficile. The finding that binding activity could not be 
destroyed by heat indicated that a carbohydrate moiety might be involved. We 
therefore examined erythrocytes from various animal species for binding activity 
since erythrocytes provide a variety of carbohydrate sequences on their cell 
surfaces. Only rabbit erythrocytes bound the toxin, and the cells agglutinated. 
A binding assay based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method for 
quantifying C. difficile toxin A was used to compare binding of the toxin to 
hamster BBMs, rabbit erythrocytes, and BBMs from rats, which are less 
susceptible to the action of C. difficile toxin A than hamsters. Results of this 
comparison indicated the following order of toxin-binding frequency: rabbit 
erythrocytes greater than hamster BBMs greater than rat BBMs. Binding of toxin A 
to hamster BBMs at 37 degrees C was comparable to what has been observed with 
cholera toxin, but binding was enhanced at 4 degrees C. A similar binding 
phenomenon was observed with rabbit erythrocytes. Examination of the cell 
surfaces of hamster BBMs and rabbit erythrocytes with lectins and specific 
glycosidases revealed a high concentration of terminal alpha-linked galactose. 
Treatment of both membrane types with alpha-galactosidase destroyed the binding 
activity. The glycoprotein, calf thyroglobulin, also bound the toxin and 
inhibited toxin binding to cells. Toxin A did not bind to human erythrocytes 
from blood group A, B, or O donors. However, after fucosidase treatment of human 
erythrocytes, only blood group B erythrocytes, which possess the blood group B 
structure Gal alpha 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-2]Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R, bound the toxin. 
This indicated that toxin A was likely binding to Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 
1-4GlcNAc, a carbohydrate sequence also found on calf thyroglobulin and rabbit 
erythrocytes. All of the results indicate that hamster BBMs contain a 
carbohydrate-binding site for toxin A that has at least a Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 
1-4GlcNAc nonreducing terminal sequence.

cascade, mediates neurite extension in N1E-115 cells.

Neurons extend neurites from the cell body before formation of the polarized 
processes of an axon and dendrites. Neurite outgrowth involves remodeling of the 
cytoskeletal components, which are initially regulated by small GTPases of the 
Rho family. Here we show that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is controlled 
by Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, is activated following neurite extension in mouse 
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells as a model. The extension is inhibited by JNK 
inhibitors (SP600125 and the small JNK-binding peptide) and Clostridium 
difficile Toxin B, the inhibitor for Rho GTPases. Additionally, paxillin, the 
multifunctional focal adhesion protein, is phosphorylated at Ser 178 by 
upregulation of the Rac1/Cdc42/JNK cascade. Conversely, transfection of the 
paxillin construct harboring the Ser 178-to-Ala mutation into cells inhibits 
neurite extension. Taken together, these results suggest the novel role of the 
Rac1/Cdc42/JNK signaling cascade in neurite extension and indicate that the 
downstream target paxillin may be one of the convergent points of various 
signaling pathways underlying neurite extension.

Expression of connective tissue growth factor in human renal fibroblasts: 
regulatory roles of RhoA and cAMP.

Heusinger-Ribeiro J(1), Eberlein M, Wahab NA, Goppelt-Struebe M.

Author information:
(1)Medical Clinic IV, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.

The induction of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was investigated in a 
human renal fibroblast cell line that exhibited many characteristics of primary 
human renal fibroblasts. Induction of CTGF mRNA was observed after treatment of 
the cells with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) or, even more 
prominently, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA induced a rapid transient increase 
in CTGF mRNA expression, with maximal levels being observed after 1 to 2 h. This 
increase was accompanied by CTGF protein synthesis. Induction of CTGF was 
insensitive to pertussis toxin and was not dependent on the activation of p42/44 
mitogen-activated protein kinases. Inhibition of the proteins of the Rho family 
with toxin B from Clostridium difficile abrogated basal and LPA-mediated 
induction of CTGF. Specific targeting of RhoA with C3 exotoxin or of the Rho 
kinases with the inhibitor Y-27632 similarly prevented induction of CTGF, 
implicating RhoA as a signaling module downstream of LPA. Inhibition of RhoA 
depolymerized the actin cytoskeleton, as did treatment with cytochalasin D. 
Preincubation of the human renal fibroblasts with cytochalasin D prevented 
induction of CTGF by LPA, indicating a strong contribution of an intact 
cytoskeleton. Interference with RhoA signaling similarly inhibited the induction 
of CTGF by TGF-beta. Elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP and thus 
activation of protein kinase A prevented induction of CTGF expression. The 
cytoskeletal effects of cAMP, however, were reversed by LPA. These data indicate 
complex interactions involving LPA-mediated activation of RhoA- and protein 
kinase A-dependent signaling pathways. The data thus demonstrate the regulatory 
functions of the small GTPase RhoA and of an intact cytoskeleton in the 
expression of CTGF after stimulation with LPA or TGF-beta. Analogous signal 
transduction pathways were previously demonstrated in rat mesangial cells, 
suggesting a more general role for RhoA in the regulation of CTGF expression.

Toxin A peptide from Clostridium difficile caused damage and secretion in the 
intestinal mucosa. These effects are mediated in part by pro-inflammatory 
substances. In order to evaluate and compare the biologic effect of toxin A on 
renal vascular, glomerular and tubular functions, we studied this toxin in 
isolated rat kidneys. Isolated kidneys from adult male Wistar rats (260-320 g) 
were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 60 mg/ml dialyzed bovine 
serum albumin. We studied the effect of toxin A peptide (3.2 x 10(-6) M, 
injected into perfusate) on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary flow rate 
(UF) and total sodium reabsorption (TNa+, %). All experiments were preceded by a 
30-min basal period, and in another group of kidneys the time course of the 
variables was followed without toxin infusion for unpaired control. Toxin A 
(TxA) reduced the perfusion pressure (PP), from PPcontrol/30min = 124.89 +/- 
1.91 to PPTxA/120min = 88.13 +/- 5.1 mmHg (N = 6, P < 0.01) with a maximal 
effect at 120 min after toxin infusion. TxA also caused a significant decrease 
in GFR with maximal effect at 90 min after toxin infusion (GFRcontrol/30min = 
0.53 +/- 0.05 to GFRTxA/90min = 0.30 + 0.05 ml min-1g-1; N = 6, P < 0.01). TxA 
did not alter renal tubular sodium transport when compared with a control 
without toxin infusion. In addition, toxin-treated kidneys caused a 
time-dependent increase in urinary flow from UFcontrol/30min = 0.16 +/- 0.08 to 
UFTxA/120min = 0.35 +/- 0.1 ml min-1g-1 (N = 6, P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Five mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Clostridium difficile toxin B 
have been raised and characterized. Three of them were immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
antibodies (6B10, 6G3, and 10B9), and the other two were of the IgG1 isotype 
(9E5 and 17G2), recognizing specifically two distinct epitopes on the toxin B 
molecule. No MAb was able to neutralize cytotoxic activity significantly. The 
two IgG1 MAbs were purified and applied to various immunodiagnostic assays. MAbs 
coupled to latex beads were used for specific removal of toxin B from cytotoxic 
samples and for agglutination assay. An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay with MAb 9E5 or 17G2 as the capture antibody was established 
for identification of toxin B with a lower detection limit of 5 ng/ml.

Impairment of autoregulatory vasodilation by NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent

artery.

Genetic Engineering, Pusan National University, Korea.

This study assessed the mechanism(s) by which the autoregulatory vasodilation of 
rat pial artery in response to acute hypotension during the acute phase of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was markedly blunted. Increased superoxide 
production from the cerebral vessels in response to NAD(P)H at 24 hours after 
SAH + NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (10 mg/kg) was inhibited by 
intracisternal administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 
micromol/L) and Rac inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B (1 ng/mL) and a 
flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (10 micromol/L). The expression of 
gp91phox was enhanced by SAH + l-NAME from 12 to 24 hours, which was inhibited 
by genistein and toxin B, but not the p22phox. Increased membrane translocation 
of Rac after SAH + l-NAME was attenuated by both genistein and toxin B, whereas 
increased tyrosine kinase activity was blocked by genistein, but not by toxin B. 
The blunted autoregulatory vasodilation to acute hypotension was effectively 
recovered by genistein and C. difficile toxin B as well as by 
diphenyleneiodonium. In conclusion, SAH during acute stage causes an increase in 
NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide formation in cerebral vessels, which is due 
to activation of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent increased expression of 
gp91phox mRNA and translocation of Rac protein, thereby resulting in a 
significant reduction of autoregulatory vasodilation.

Lysophosphatidic acid-mediated signal-transduction pathways involved in the 
induction of the early-response genes prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 and Egr-1: a 
critical role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and for Rho proteins.

During inflammatory processes of the kidney, lesions of the glomerulus lead to 
aggregation of thrombocytes and infiltration of macrophages, which can release 
bioactive mediators. One of these important signalling molecules is 
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Incubation of rat mesangial cells with LPA induced 
mRNA and protein expression of the early-response genes pghs-2 (for 
prostaglandin G/H synthase-2/cyclo-oxygenase-2) and egr-1. As shown by antisense 
experiments, induction of egr-1 was related to the strong mitogenic effect of 
LPA. LPA-mediated gene expression was inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating 
coupling to G-proteins of the Gi family. Specific inhibition of proteins of the 
small G-protein subfamily Rho with toxin B from Clostridium difficile led to 
changes in mesangial cell morphology without induction of apoptosis. 
LPA-mediated expression of pghs-2 and egr-1 was reduced to base-line levels by 
toxin B, indicating a role for Rho proteins in LPA-mediated gene induction. Of 
the two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways investigated, the MAPK 
kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway was involved in the 
induction of both pghs-2 and egr-1 mRNA expression, as shown by the inhibitory 
effect of PD98059. Activation of the MAPK p38, however, was only related to 
pghs-2 expression, whereas egr-1 expression was not affected by treatment of 
mesangial cells with the specific inhibitor SB203580. Taken together our data 
provide evidence that LPA-mediated activation of MAPK kinase and Rho proteins 
leads to the induction of the functionally distinct early-response genes pghs-2 
and egr-1, whereas activation of MAPK p38 revealed considerable differences 
between the regulation of these two genes.

Carolina, USA.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nerves have been suggested to mediate the effects of 
bacterial toxins in intestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are 
unknown. This study examined endogenous substance P (SP) activation of the 
substance P receptor (SPR) on enteric neurons in the rat ileum after exposure to 
intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A.
METHODS: After intraluminal injection of toxin A in ileal loops, tissue was 
examined for pathological changes by histology and for SPR activation by 
immunocytochemical analysis of SP-induced SPR endocytosis.
RESULTS: After toxin A administration, > 70% of enteric neurons showed SPR 
endocytosis and became swollen with thickened dendrites. In contrast, SPRs in 
control rats were largely confined to the plasma membrane. Rats denervated of 
primary afferent fibers with neonatal capsaicin injection and animals pretreated 
with a nonpeptide SPR antagonist showed few endosomal SPRs, and the pathological 
inflammatory effects of toxin A were ablated.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal toxin A causes the release of SP from primary afferent 
neurons: this endogenous SP then acts on enteric neurons in the submucosal and 
myenteric plexuses. SP is the primary mediator of an axon reflex mediating 
neurogenic inflammation in the intestine. SPR blockade may prove to be a novel 
therapy used to prevent intestinal inflammation.

Toxin-induced cell membrane injury in guinea pigs given lincomycin.

Lee SP, Thomsen LL.

Guinea pigs treated with lincomycin developed colitis, acute cholecystitis and 
abnormalities in red blood cell morphology. The present study was designed to 
study the production of clostridial toxins after lincomycin treatment. 
Lincomycin produced abnormalities in conventional but not in germ-free guinea 
pigs. Clostridium difficile was cultured from cecal contents of conventional 
guinea pigs treated with lincomycin. Cecal filtrate from sick guinea pigs was 
subjected to Sepharose 4B-CL and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, yielding 
a partially purified toxin. Both cecal filtrate and partially purified toxin 
samples contained a heat labile substance which was cytotoxic to human lung 
fibroblast Wl-38 cells, and which was neutralized by Clostridium sordelli 
antitoxin. Toxin samples given orally or intraperitoneally killed normal guinea 
pigs. Finally, toxin samples induced red cell membrane changes in vitro as well 
as producing features of acute inflammation in healthy explants of guinea pig 
cecum and gallbladder in organ culture. Lincomycin treated guinea pigs produced 
Clostridium difficile toxin(s) which in turn caused diffuse cell membrane 
injury.

Toxin A of Clostridium difficile: production, purification and effect in mouse 
intestine.

Lönnroth I, Lange S.

Clostridium difficile produces one diarrhoeogenic toxin designed A, and one 
cytopathogenic toxin designed B. Toxin A was purified in a 
four-step-fractionation procedure. In the last purification step the toxin was 
separated by elution with galactose from an agarose gel. The purified toxin A 
induced a clear and watery hypersecretion in intestinal loops of mouse, while 
mixtures of toxin A and B induced a haemorrhagic secretion. At an ED50 value for 
the purified toxin A of 0.5 microgram there was a brief, optimal hypersecretion 
after four hours. Like the fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin, that 
induced by toxin A could be inhibited by chlorpromazine or by depletion of 
intestinal bile. In contrast to cholera toxin, however, toxin A did not activate 
intestinal adenylate cyclase--at least not permanently. Antisera which 
neutralized cholera toxin did not neutralize toxin A, and vice versa.

bacterial otitis media.

Mucosal hyperplasia is a characteristic component of otitis media. The present 
study investigated the participation of signaling via the Jun N-terminal protein 
kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase in middle ear mucosal hyperplasia 
in animal models of bacterial otitis media. Otitis media was induced by the 
inoculation of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae into the middle ear cavity. 
Western blotting revealed that phosphorylation of JNK isoforms in the middle ear 
mucosa preceded but paralleled mucosal hyperplasia in this in vivo rat model. 
Nuclear JNK phosphorylation was observed in many cells of both the mucosal 
epithelium and stroma by immunohistochemistry. In an in vitro model of primary 
rat middle ear mucosal explants, bacterially induced mucosal growth was blocked 
by the Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B, the mixed-lineage 
kinase inhibitor CEP11004, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Finally, the JNK 
inhibitor SP600125 significantly inhibited mucosal hyperplasia during in vivo 
bacterial otitis media in guinea pigs. Inhibition of JNK in vivo resulted in a 
diminished proliferative response, as shown by a local decrease in proliferating 
cell nuclear antigen protein expression by immunohistochemistry. We conclude 
that activation of JNK is a critical pathway for bacterially induced mucosal 
hyperplasia during otitis media, influencing tissue proliferation.

Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

We previously reported that the inflammatory effects of Clostridium difficile 
toxin A on rat intestine can be significantly inhibited with a specific 
neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. In this study we investigated the 
localization and expression of NK-1R mRNA and protein in rat intestine by in 
situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, 
respectively, after exposure to toxin A. Northern blot analysis showed increased 
mucosal levels of NK-1R mRNA starting 30 min after toxin A administration. In 
situ hybridization showed that toxin A increased NK-1R mRNA expression in 
intestinal epithelial cells after 30, 120, and 180 min. In rats pretreated with 
the NK-1R antagonist CP-96345 the increase in NK-1R mRNA levels after exposure 
to toxin A was inhibited, indicating that NK-1R upregulation is substance P (SP) 
dependent. One hour after exposure to toxin A many of the intestinal epithelial 
cells showed staining for NK-1R compared with controls. Specific 125I-SP binding 
to purified epithelial cell membranes obtained from ileum exposed to toxin A for 
15 min was increased twofold over control and persisted for 4 h. This report 
provides evidence that NK-1R expression is increased in the intestinal 
epithelium shortly after exposure to toxin A and may be important in toxin 
A-induced inflammation.

Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.

Inactivation of Rho GTPases inhibited the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. The 
role of Cdc42 in neurite outgrowth was then studied by selective inhibition of 
Cdc42 signals. Overexpression of ACK42, Cdc42 binding domain of ACK-1, inhibited 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. ACK42 also inhibited the neurite 
outgrowth of PC12 cells induced by constitutively activated mutant of Cdc42, but 
not Rac. These results suggest that Cdc42 plays an important role in mediating 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth was 
also demonstrated using a cell permeable chimeric protein, penetratin-ACK42. A 
dominant negative mutant of Rac, RacN17 inhibited Cdc42-induced neurite 
outgrowth of PC12 cells suggesting that Rac acts downstream of Cdc42. Further 
studies, using primary-cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons, showed that 
Cdc42 is also involved in the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar granule neurons. 
Both penetratin-ACK42 and Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates all 
members of Rho GTPases strongly inhibited the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar 
granule neurons. These results show that Cdc42 plays a similar and essential 
role in the development of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and cerebellar 
granule neurons. These results provide evidence that Cdc42 produces signals that 
are essential for the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and cerebellar granule 
neurons.

[Effect of the ingestion of wheat bran on the fecal microbial flora of human 
donors and of recipient gnotoxenic mice, and on the barrier effects exerted by 
these flora against various potentially pathogenic microorganisms].

[Article in French]

Ducluzeau R, Ladiré M, Raibaud P.

The effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was 
studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial 
populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect 
exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of 
the environment. Since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, 
we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. 
Faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained 
prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. These faecal samples were inoculated 
into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. The dominant floras of the 
human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. The faecal 
floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change 
resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. The drastic 
or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors 
against Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. 
The large variability between animals in the barrier effect against Clostridium 
difficile masked any possible role of the bran. Study of the transit of Bacillus 
spores in the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of 
differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according 
to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.

A non-haemagglutinating form of Clostridium difficile toxin A.

Kamiya S(1), Borriello SP.

Author information:
(1)Microbial Pathogenicity Research Group, MRC Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, 
Middlesex.

Analysis of crude culture filtrate of Clostridium difficile by Mono Q-anion 
exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) demonstrated that toxin A had 
distinct peaks of activity for cytotoxicity and haemagglutination, as also did 
highly purified toxin A obtained by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography (TG) 
followed by two sequential anion-exchange chromatographic steps with Q-Sepharose 
FF and Mono Q. From TG unbound fractions a highly cytotoxic but weakly 
haemagglutinating variant (toxin A') of toxin A was obtained by Q-Sepharose FF 
and Mono Q chromatography. Analysis of toxins A and A' from cultures of C. 
difficile in a chemically defined medium, and of toxin A dialysed against brain 
heart infusion broth, indicated that A' was not merely toxin A coupled to a 
component of the growth medium. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under 
non-denaturing conditions showed that toxins A and A' had the same Mr. 
Immunoblotting with mouse monospecific A antitoxin showed that five bands larger 
than the major 240-Kda band were more strongly developed in toxin A than in A' 
in denaturing but non-reducing conditions, and in reducing conditions eight 
bands (38-175 Kda) were seen in toxin A but not A'. Immunoblotting with a 
monoclonal antibody (PCG-4) showed that, in both reducing and non-reducing 
conditions, two bands of 160 and 155 Kda were more prominent in toxins A and A' 
respectively, and four bands (195, 180, 175 and 125 Kda) were detected only in 
toxin A'.

Infections after experimental cadaver bone marrow transplantation in beagle 
dogs. Transplantations with and without selective gastrointestinal 
decontamination.

Experimental transplantations of cadaver bone marrow (BMT) in beagle dogs were 
performed to evaluate the problems and potentials in a preclinical setting. The 
effectiveness of selective decontamination of the gut (SD) and gnotobiotic 
surveillance in preventing infections during longer aplastic periods was 
investigated. Three groups of dogs were compared. Group A: controls. Group B: 
dogs with BMT, without SD and irregular gnotobiotic surveillance. Group C: dogs 
with BMT, with SD and regular gnotobiotic surveillance. The intestinal 
colonization of normal healthy beagles shows similarities as well as 
dissimilarities to the human intestinal microflora. Aerobic potentially 
pathogenic organisms do not colonize the gut of healthy beagles under our 
keeping conditions. SD resulted in a significant decrease in infections with 
Escherichia coli and Plesiomonas. Infections with anaerobes, as well as 
bacterial infections of the respiratory tract were, however, not prevented. The 
intestinal colonization in dogs of group C with Clostridium difficile is another 
obvious effect of SD. The infections encountered during the study indicate the 
importance of the "take" for the clinical significance and outcome of intestinal 
colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms. In order to reduce the drug 
burden of BMT patients, we consider the elimination of routine SD after BMT not 
to be superior to gnotobiotic surveillance and germ-specific short term 
decontamination.

Effects of purified Clostridium difficile toxin A in the small intestine of the 
rat in vivo.

University of Graz, Austria.

The action of highly purified Clostridium difficile toxin A was studied in the 
jejunum of rats in vivo. C. difficile toxin A reversed dose-dependently net 
fluid absorption into net fluid secretion, accompanied by an increase in 
prostaglandin E2 but not 5-hydroxytryptamine output into the gut lumen. 
Accordingly, indomethacin but not the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists 
ketanserin plus tropisetron were able to inhibit toxin A-induced fluid 
secretion. Atropine and hexamethonium were without effect on the action of toxin 
A, such excluding a nervous mechanism. The cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and 
cyclic GMP appear not to be involved in the mediation of the secretory response. 
The reduced cyclic GMP levels are most likely the result of a complete 
destruction of the villus membranes, where the guanylate cyclase is located. 
Histological studies revealed massive damage to intestinal villi, whereas the 
majority of the crypts seem to be unaffected. In conclusion, toxin A-induced 
intestinal fluid secretion appears to be caused mainly by severe mucosal damage. 
PGE2-release may be the consequence of the inflammation accompanying this 
damage. The mechanism seems to be completely different to those of cholera toxin 
or Escherichia coli heat stable enterotoxin.

Human antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis are partly 
due to toxin production by Clostridium difficile. It is now well documented that 
Saccharomyces boulardii protects against C. difficile induced diseases. In an 
attempt to understand better the mechanism of this protective effect, the action 
of S. boulardii on a crude toxin preparation was studied in vitro and in vivo. 
The results showed that the yeast had no effect on the toxins in vitro but was 
able to protect mice inoculated with these toxins. Furthermore, the observation 
by scanning electron microscopy that the mucosa of S. boulardii protected mice 
was not damaged suggest that the yeast mainly acts on the intestinal mucosa.

Although Cl difficile bacteremia and the presence of antibodies to toxin A (TxA) 
have been reported, little information is available at present on TxA effect on 
the functional properties of various visceral organs. We have, therefore, 
examined the in vitro effects of TxA on amylase and trypsin secretion from rat 
isolated pancreatic acini. Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were exposed for 60 
min to different concentrations of highly purified TxA and the rate of amylase, 
trypsin and LDH release were monitored. Free cytosolic calcium release in 
pancreatic acini after toxin A (10(-10)M to 10(-8)M) treatment was measured with 
Fura-2/AM, Ca-indicator dye. TxA (10(-10) to 10(-8)M) increased significantly 
the rate of both the amylase and trypsin secretion without any membrane damage, 
with toxin A exerting its action via calcium dependent pathway as suggested by 
intracellular calcium release measured with Fura-2/AM.

Antibiotic treatment is often followed by Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), 
which causes severe diarrhea and other health issues. Oral administration of 
Pediococcus pentosaceus Li05 (Li05) has been shown to have great potential in 
preventing CDI. However, the viability of Li05 is greatly reduced during storage 
and passage through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which limits its biological 
activity. In this study, a gastro-responsive microgel was designed to 
encapsulate and protect Li05 to enhance its efficacy against CDI. The viability 
of Li05 encapsulated within the microgels was significantly enhanced during 
long-term storage and after exposure to simulated GI fluids. Moreover, this 
gastro-responsive microgel led to greater sustained release of the probiotic. In 
a mouse CDI model, we found that encapsulated Li05 was better at inhibiting C. 
difficile infection than nonencapsulated Li05, as demonstrated through analysis 
of the probiotic survival rate, spleen weight, colonic histology, and 
inflammatory cytokine levels. Moreover, the gut microbial diversity was enriched 
by treatment with encapsulated Li05. These results suggest that encapsulating 
Li05 within biopolymer microgels may enhance its ability to prevent and treat 
CDI using functional foods, supplements, or pharmaceuticals.

[Transfer of the cecal flora of the hamster to the germfree C3H mouse: use of 
this model to study the flora of the anti-Clostridium difficile barrier].

[Article in French]

Su WJ, Bourlioux P, Bournaud M, Besnier MO, Fourniat J.

The purpose of this work was the research and development of an experimental 
model to study anti-Clostridium difficile caecal microflora in the hamster. 
First the existence of this "barrier" was verified in conventional hamsters. 
Then, the caecal flora from these animals was orally transferred to C3H germfree 
mice. The barrier effect was maintained in the axenic mice. The comparative 
bacteriological analysis of hamster and mouse feces did not reveal important 
variations in the dominant anaerobic flora (P less than 0.01). After treatment 
with erythromycin, the barrier effect was maintained and while the disappearance 
of Escherichia coli was observed, the dominant anaerobic flora persisted. After 
dilution (10(-2] and subsequent heating (70 degrees C, 10 min) of caecal 
contents, the inhibitory activity against C. difficile was maintained although 
the number of aerobic and aerotolerant bacteria was reduced. The isolation from 
caecal microflora of anaerobic strains implicated in the resistance to 
colonization is presently underway in Freter anaerobic chambers.

Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high 
and prolonged levels in blood.

Grappel SF, Giovenella AJ, Phillips L, Pitkin DH, Nisbet LJ.

Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by 
Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro 
which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these 
glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of 
vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution 
and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In 
vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of 
Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 
spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of 
Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other 
glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In 
experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, 
S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 
50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after 
infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level 
in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins 
were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in 
mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

Chemoresistance remains the major challenge for successful treatment of acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML). Although recent mouse studies suggest that treatment 
response of genetically and immunophenotypically indistinguishable AML can be 
influenced by their different cells of origin, corresponding evidence in human 
disease is still largely lacking. By combining prospective disease modeling 
using highly purified human hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells with 
retrospective deconvolution study of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from primary 
patient samples, we identified human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and common 
myeloid progenitors (CMPs) as two distinctive origins of human AML driven by 
Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene fusions (MLL-AML). Despite LSCs from either 
MLL-rearranged HSCs or MLL-rearranged CMPs having a mature CD34-/lo/CD38+ 
immunophenotype in both a humanized mouse model and primary patient samples, the 
resulting AML cells exhibited contrasting responses to chemotherapy. HSC-derived 
MLL-AML was highly resistant to chemotherapy and expressed elevated amounts of 
the multispecific anion transporter ABCC3. Inhibition of ABCC3 by shRNA-mediated 
knockdown or with small-molecule inhibitor fidaxomicin, currently used for 
diarrhea associated with Clostridium difficile infection, effectively 
resensitized HSC-derived MLL-AML toward standard chemotherapeutic drugs. This 
study not only functionally established two distinctive origins of human LSCs 
for MLL-AML and their role in mediating chemoresistance but also identified a 
potential therapeutic avenue for stem cell-associated treatment resistance by 
repurposing a well-tolerated antidiarrhea drug already used in the clinic.

In rat intestinal crypt cells, Clostridium difficile toxin A induces (i) early 
cytoskeletal alterations involving the whole population and (ii) late effects in 
30 to 40% of the cells, consisting mainly of surface blebbing and nuclear 
fragmentation. All these effects were Ca2+ independent and were not abolished by 
protein synthesis inhibitors.

Inhibition of Rho protein stimulates iNOS expression in rat vascular smooth 
muscle cells.

Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
is upregulated in arterial injury and plays a role in regulating VSMC 
proliferation and restenosis. Inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1beta 
(IL-1beta)] released during vascular injury induce iNOS. Small GTP-binding 
proteins of the Ras superfamily play a major role in IL-1beta-dependent 
signaling pathways. In this study, we examined the role of Rho GTPases in 
regulating iNOS expression in VSMCs. Treatment of VSMCs with mevastatin, which 
inhibits isoprenylation of Rho and other small GTP-binding proteins, produced 
significantly higher amounts of IL-1beta-evoked NO and iNOS protein compared 
with control. Similarly, bacterial toxins [Toxin B from Clostridium difficile 
and C3 ADP-ribosyl transferase (C3) toxin from Clostridium botulinium] that 
specifically inactivate Rho proteins increased NOS products (NO and citrulline) 
and iNOS expression. Toxin B increased the activity of iNOS promoter-reporter 
construct in VSMCs. Both toxins enhanced IL-1beta-stimulated iNOS expression and 
NO production. These data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of Rho 
induces iNOS and suggest a role for Rho protein in IL-1beta-stimulated NO 
production in VSMCs.

Inhibition of Clostridium difficile toxin A and B by 1,2-cyclohexanedione 
modification of an arginine residue.

Balfanz J(1), Rautenberg P.

Toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin) of Clostridium difficile were both 
inactivated by the arginine specific reagent 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Molecular 
stability during the inactivation process was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis 
showing the same migration rates for modified and unmodified forms of the 230 
kDa toxin A and of the 250 kDa toxin B. Cytotoxicity of both toxins as well as 
mouse lethality of the enterotoxin were drastically decreased as a result of the 
arginine modification. The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. 
Analysis of the data suggested that modification of a single arginine residue 
was sufficient to abolish the activity of both toxins.

Immunological comparison of intracellular toxin A and extracellular toxin A from 
Clostridium difficile.

Ishikawa.

Intracellular toxin A and extracellular toxin A of Clostridium difficile were 
compared immunologically. Immunodiffusion tests with anti-intracellular toxin A 
and anti-extracellular toxin A sera showed that these toxins were identical. In 
neutralization tests, both antisera neutralized the homologous and heterologous 
toxins with regard to cytotoxicity, mouse lethality and loop response at nearly 
the same titers. Although intracellular toxin A lacks the hemagglutination (HA) 
activity, anti-intracellular toxin A serum neutralized HA activity of 
extracellular toxin A at the same titer as did anti-extracellular toxin A serum. 
These results suggest that these toxins are immunologically indistinguishable 
and that the intracellular toxin A molecule has an antigenic site(s) for the HA 
activity.

Stimulation of enzyme secretion from isolated pancreatic acini by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B.

Vesenka GD, Majumdar AP, Dubick MA, Lyerly DM, Wilkins TD, Silva J Jr, Geokas 
MC.

Exposure of isolated rat pancreatic acini to increasing concentrations (10 ng - 
800 ng/ml) of toxin B from Clostridium difficile produced a biphasic effect on 
the rate of secretion of amylase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen. Whereas 
doses of toxin B from 10-30 ng/ml increased enzyme secretion by 15-20%, doses 
between 30 ng and 60 ng/ml showed a regression of this effect, whereafter the 
rate of secretion of amylase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen increased with 
increasing concentrations of the toxin. Toxin B concentration of 800 ng/ml 
enhanced amylase, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen secretion by 119%, 185% and 
195%, respectively, when compared with the basal level. Stimulation of enzyme 
secretion by toxin B was not affected by the presence of either actinomycin-D or 
cycloheximide, at a concentration which inhibited acinar RNA or protein 
synthesis by 80-90%. Although toxin B as well as CCK8, carbachol and secretin by 
themselves caused significant stimulation in amylase, trypsinogen and 
chymotrypsinogen secretion from isolated pancreatic acini, toxin B together with 
either CCK8, carbachol or secretin produced no further augmentation in enzyme 
secretion than what was observed with the secretagogues alone. It is concluded 
that toxin B of Cl. difficile exerts a direct effect on pancreatic acinar cells 
as evidenced by stimulation of enzyme secretion.

Purification and characterisation of intracellular toxin A of Clostridium 
difficile.

Meng XQ(1), Kamiya S, Yamakawa K, Ogura H, Nakamura S.

After sonic disintegration of Clostridium difficile cells, intracellular toxin A 
was purified to homogeneity by thyroglobulin affinity chromatography (TGAC) 
followed by anion-exchange (Mono Q) by fast protein liquid chromatography 
(FPLC). High haemagglutinating (HA) activity was detected in TGAC-unbound 
fractions (2(9)/50 microliters), but not in TGAC thermal eluates (2(0)/50 
microliters). The low HA titre of the thermal eluates was markedly increased to 
2(5)/50 microliters after dialysis against 0.02 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). A disparity 
in the position of the peaks containing cytotoxic and HA activity was observed 
in the first Mono Q-FPLC step. Intracellular toxin A without HA activity was 
obtained by a second Mono Q-FPLC step. The M(r) of the intracellular toxin A was 
estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to be 580 kDa under 
non-denaturing conditions. The minimum doses of the toxin causing cytotoxicity, 
mouse lethality and enterotoxicity were 0.83 ng, 8.7 ng and 5 micrograms, 
respectively.

The capsaicin VR1 receptor mediates substance P release in toxin A-induced 
enteritis in rats.

McVey DC(1), Vigna SR.

Durham V. A. Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.

The mechanism by which Clostridium difficile toxin A causes substance P (SP) 
release and subsequent inflammation in the rat ileum is unknown. Pretreatment 
with the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonist, capsazepine, before 
toxin A administration significantly inhibited toxin A-induced SP release and 
intestinal inflammation. Intraluminal administration of the VR1 agonist 
capsaicin caused intestinal inflammation similar to the effects of toxin A. 
Pretreatment with capsazepine before capsaicin administration also significantly 
inhibited capsaicin-induced intestinal inflammation. These results suggest that 
intraluminal toxin A causes SP release from primary sensory neurons via 
stimulation of VR1 receptors resulting in intestinal inflammation.

Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin.

In order to investigate the regulation of presynaptic phospholipase D (PLD) 
activity by calcium and G proteins, we established a permeabilization procedure 
for rat cortical synaptosomes using Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin (30-100 
microg/ml). In permeabilized synaptosomes, PLD activity was significantly 
stimulated when the concentration of free calcium was increased from 0.1 microM 
to 1 microM. This activation was inhibited in the presence of KN-62 (1 microM), 
an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), but not by the 
protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro 31-8220 (1-10 microM). Synaptosomal PLD activity 
was also stimulated in the presence of 1 microM GTPgammaS. When Rho proteins 
were inhibited by pretreatment of the synaptosomes with Clostridium difficile 
toxin B (TcdB; 1-10 ng/ml), the effect of GTPgammaS was significantly reduced; 
in contrast, brefeldin A (10-100 microM), an inhibitor of ARF activation, was 
ineffective. Calcium stimulation of PLD was inhibited by TcdB, but 
GTPgammaS-dependent activation was insensitive to KN-62. We conclude that 
synaptosomal PLD is activated in a pathway which sequentially involves CaMKII 
and Rho proteins.

Clostridium difficile (toxin) associated typhlitis was diagnosed in untreated 
barrier-maintained specific pathogen free guineapigs. It resembled the 
pathological lesions of antibiotic induced enterocolitis. The possible role of 
limited colonization resistance to C. difficile provided by mouse enteric 
microflora in the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed.

Nine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to Clostridium difficile toxin A were produced. 
The isotype of one mAb (37B5) was IgG2b, kappa, and that of the other eight mAbs 
was IgM, kappa. Immunoblot analysis after non-denatured PAGE showed that with 
the exception of one mAb (112G6) all mAbs gave a positive reaction with the 540 
kDa band of toxin A. Immunoblot analysis showed that four mAbs (2E15, 3B4, 37B5 
and 49C4) gave a positive reaction with the 240 kDa major band of toxin A. In 
neutralisation tests with these mAbs for enterotoxicity, mouse lethality, 
haemagglutination activity and cytotoxicity, 37B5 neutralised enterotoxicity in 
a rabbit ileal loop response test but did not neutralise any other biological 
activities. None of the other eight mAbs showed any neutralising activities at 
all.

Clostridium difficile toxin A was evaluated for an antitumor effect in vivo on 
HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. A mean 
reduction in tumor volume of at least 65%, by measurement in three dimensions, 
was observed in mice who received two 9- to 13-day courses of daily 
intraperitoneal injections of toxin A as compared to mice receiving diluent 
alone. Reversible adverse effects of toxin A were noted in some animals, 
consisting primarily of liver toxicity and skin rash. HCT 116 cells in toxin 
A-treated mice grew as flattened tumors with ulcerated centers compared to 
rounded tumors without ulceration in controls. Histologic examination of tumors 
from representative mice revealed that two thirds of the tumor in a treated 
mouse was necrotic compared to only one third in a control, suggesting greater 
antitumor efficacy of toxin A than estimated by tumor measurements alone.

Efficacy of oral ramoplanin for inhibition of intestinal colonization by 
vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice.

Western Reserve University, Ohio 44106, USA.

Ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic with activity against 
gram-positive bacteria that is in clinical trials for prevention of 
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bloodstream infections and treatment of 
Clostridium difficile diarrhea. Orally administered ramoplanin suppresses VRE 
intestinal colonization, but recurrences after discontinuation of treatment have 
frequently been observed. We used a mouse model to examine the efficacy of 
ramoplanin for inhibition of VRE colonization and evaluated the etiology of 
recurrences of colonization. Eight days of treatment with ramoplanin (100 
microg/ml) in drinking water suppressed VRE to undetectable levels, but 100% of 
mice developed recurrent colonization; a higher dose of 500 microg/ml in water 
was associated with recurrent colonization in 50% of mice. Two of eight (25%) 
mice treated with the 100-microg/ml dose of ramoplanin had low levels of VRE in 
their cecal tissues on day 8 despite undetectable levels in stool and cecal 
contents. Mice that received prior ramoplanin treatment did not develop VRE 
overgrowth when challenged with 10(7) CFU of oral VRE 1, 2, or 4 days later. In 
communal cages, rapid cross-transmission and overgrowth of VRE was observed 
among clindamycin-treated mice; ramoplanin treatment effectively suppressed VRE 
overgrowth in such communal cages. Ramoplanin treatment promoted increased 
density of indigenous Enterobacteriaceae and overgrowth of an exogenously 
administered Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate. These results demonstrate the 
efficacy of ramoplanin for inhibition of VRE colonization and suggest that some 
recurrences occur due to reexpansion of organisms that persist within the lining 
of the colon. Ramoplanin treatment may be associated with overgrowth of 
gram-negative bacilli.

ADP-ribosylating and glucosylating toxins as tools to study secretion in RBL 
cells.

The influence of different ADP-ribosylating and glucosylating cytotoxins on 
stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in rat basophilic 
leukemia (RBL) cells was studied. Treatment of RBL cells with Clostridium 
botulinum C2 toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylated monomeric G-actin and 
caused complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells, 
inhibited Fc epsilon RI receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of various 
proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects at 
100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2I. C2 toxin (10 ng/ml C2I and 20 ng/ml C2II) 
increased antigen- or calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated [3H]serotonin 
release maximally by about 3 fold. Clostridium botulinum C3, which 
ADP-ribosylated Rho in intact RBL cells, had no effect on protein tyrosine 
phosphorylation and stimulated secretion. In contrast, the cytotoxic Clostridium 
difficile toxin B (ToxB), which glucosylated the Rho-subtype family members RhoA 
and Cdc42, blocked or reduced antigen- or calcium ionophore-mediated 
[3H]serotonin release, respectively, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 
110 kDa protein. The data indicate that different actin pools control tyrosine 
phosphorylation and secretion in RBL cells and suggest that Rho subfamily 
proteins regulate secretion independently of the actin cytoskeleton.

Gastrointestinal infection as a trigger for inflammatory bowel disease.

Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. 
Elizabeth.mann@cchmc.org

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes 
in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. 
This review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal 
pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: A number of intestinal pathogens including Mycobacterium avium 
subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli, and 
Campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with Crohn's 
disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. In 
a prospective study, M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early 
Crohn's disease was low and comparable to controls, while much higher in an 
established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. In the pediatric setting, a high 
prevalence of Clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive Crohn's 
disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Some studies have speculated that 
Salmonella or Campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory 
bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure 
the risk. Recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of 
factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal 
microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology.
SUMMARY: No evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single 
agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been strongly associated 
with the presence of disease. The majority of recent studies support a role for 
the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in 
individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which 
remain to be identified. These factors may include subsets of commensal 
microflora.

Antibiotics excreted into the intestinal tract may disrupt the microbiota that 
provide colonization resistance against enteric pathogens and alter normal 
metabolic functions of the microbiota. Many of the bacterial metabolites 
produced in the intestinal tract are absorbed systemically and excreted in 
urine. Here, we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that alterations in 
levels of targeted bacterial metabolites in urine specimens could provide useful 
biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact colonization resistance. To assess in 
vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with Clostridium difficile 
spores orally 3, 6, and 11 days after the completion of 2 days of treatment with 
piperacillin-tazobactam, aztreonam, or saline. For concurrent groups of 
antibiotic-treated mice, urine samples were analyzed by using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the 
concentrations of 11 compounds targeted as potential biomarkers of colonization 
resistance. Aztreonam did not affect colonization resistance, whereas 
piperacillin-tazobactam disrupted colonization resistance 3 days after 
piperacillin-tazobactam treatment, with complete recovery by 11 days after 
treatment. Three of the 11 compounds exhibited a statistically significant and 
>10-fold increase (the tryptophan metabolite N-acetyltryptophan) or decrease 
(the plant polyphenyl derivatives cinnamoylglycine and enterodiol) in 
concentrations in urine 3 days after piperacillin-tazobactam treatment, followed 
by recovery to baseline that coincided with the restoration of in vivo 
colonization resistance. These urinary metabolites could provide useful and 
easily accessible biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted colonization 
resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

Evidence for differential roles of the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins in 
glucose- and calcium-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.

We utilized clostridial toxins (with known specificities for inhibition of 
GTPases) to ascertain the contribution of candidate GTPases in physiologic 
insulin secretion from beta cells. Exposure of normal rat islets or isolated 
beta (HIT-T15) cells to Clostridium difficile toxins A and B catalyzed the 
glucosylation (and thereby the inactivation) of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho endogenous 
to beta cells; concomitantly, either toxin reduced glucose- or potassium-induced 
insulin secretion from rat islets and HIT cells. Treatment of beta cells with 
Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (LT; which modified only Ras, Rap, and Rac) 
also reduced glucose- or potassium-induced secretion. However, clostridial toxin 
C3-exoenzyme (which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates only Rho) was without any 
effect on either glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion. These data 
suggest that Cdc42, Rac, Ras, and/or Rap (but not Rho) may be needed for 
glucose- or potassium-mediated secretion. The effects of these toxins appear to 
be specific on stimulus-secretion coupling, since no difference in metabolic 
viability (assessed colorimetrically by quantitating the conversion of the 
tetrazolium salt into a formazan in a reduction reaction driven by nutrient 
metabolism) was demonstrable between control and toxin (A or LT)-treated beta 
cells. Toxin (A or LT) treatment also did not alter glucose- or 
potassium-mediated rises in cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), 
suggesting that these GTPases are involved in steps distal to elevations in 
[Ca2+]i. Recent findings indicate that the carboxyl methylation of Cdc42 is 
stimulated by only glucose, whereas that of Rap (Kowluru et al., J Clin Invest 
98: 540-555, 1996) and Rac (present study) are regulated by glucose or 
potassium. Together, these findings provide direct evidence, for the first time, 
that the Rho subfamily of GTPases plays a key regulatory role(s) in insulin 
secretion, and they suggest that Cdc42 may be required for early steps in 
glucose stimulation of insulin release, whereas Rap and/or Rac may be required 
for a later step(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling cascade (i.e. 
Ca2+-induced exocytosis of insulin).

Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in 
urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human 
populations than most other mammals. Despite the potential role of rats as 
reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat 
populations remains unexplored. In this study, we used targeted molecular assays 
to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased 
high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human 
disease in commensal Norway rats in New York City. We found that these rats are 
infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis 
in people, including atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium 
difficile, and Salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been 
associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including Bartonella spp., 
Streptobacillus moniliformis, Leptospira interrogans, and Seoul hantavirus. We 
also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain 
important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, 
parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. The two novel hepaciviruses 
discovered in this study replicate in the liver of Norway rats and may have 
utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis C virus 
infection. The results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes 
carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen 
surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. Importance: The 
observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal 
reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs 
in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. Strikingly, less attention 
has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in 
urban centers and close proximity to human populations. To begin to explore the 
zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed 
Norway rats collected in New York City over a 1-year period. This analysis 
revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study 
population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or 
febrile illnesses in people. Our findings indicate that urban rats are 
reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and 
indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks 
associated with urban rodent infestation.

Several G protein-coupled receptors which stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) also 
activate phospholipase D (PLD) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we characterized PLD 
activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by the PLC-stimulatory thrombin 
receptor PAR1, in comparison to the endothelin-1 receptor ET(A)R, which induces 
PLD stimulation by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) delta and epsilon. 
Similar to ET(A)R, activation of PAR1 induced PLD stimulation, which, however, 
was insensitive to PKC inhibition. Furthermore, in contrast to ET(A)R, PLD 
stimulation by PAR1 was suppressed by overexpression of regulators of G protein 
signaling specific for G(12)-type G proteins and treatment with brefeldin A, an 
inhibitor of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor 
(ARF) GTPases. On the other hand, inactivation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B and treatment with general tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
suppressed PAR1- and ET(A)R- as well as phorbol ester-induced PLD stimulation 
and was associated with a fall in the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). We conclude that, in contrast to ET(A)R-PLD coupling, 
PAR1-induced cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation is PKC-independent and mediated by 
G(12)-type G proteins and ARF GTPases, while Rho and tyrosine kinases regulate 
PLD stimulation by either receptor, apparently by controlling the cellular level 
of PIP(2), a common regulator of PLD activity.

Spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) has been considered as an alternative for 
in-feed antibiotics to improve pig growth performance; however, the effect of 
SDPP on gut microbiota is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
effects of feeding SDPP on fecal microbial communities of nursery pigs. 
Ninety-six weaned pigs were assigned to 16 pens, which were allotted to two 
dietary treatments, including the control or the control + SDPP (5% and 2.5% 
SDPP inclusion in phase 1 and 2, respectively) diet. Fecal samples were 
collected at d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Multiplex sequencing of V3 region of the 
16S rRNA gene was used to characterize the bacterial community structure of 
fecal samples. Pearson's correlation tests were performed in Calypso to identify 
bacterial taxa that were either positively or negatively associated with overall 
growth performance. Feeding SDPP altered microbial structure at family, genus, 
and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) classifications; however, fecal microbes 
shifted with time. At the family level, Clostridiaceae increased (P < 0.001) on 
d 14, but decreased (P < 0.05) on d 28 in SDPP-fed pigs compared with control 
pigs. Decreased Veillonellaceae (P < 0.05; d 14) and Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.001; 
overall) were observed in SDPP-fed pigs compared with control pigs. Feeding SDPP 
increased lactic acid-producing bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii, d 7) and 
cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, d 7; Clostridium thermocellum, d 7 
and 14; and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum/beijerinckii, d 14; and 
Megasphaera elsdenii, d 21). On d 28, feeding SDPP decreased (P < 0.05) 
Clostridium difficile compared with control pigs. In conclusion, feeding SDPP 
altered fecal microbial communities in nursery pigs. The results of this study 
may provide information to help explain the positive effects associated with 
feeding SDPP on nutrient digestibility and gut health of nursery pigs.

The gut microbiota has a key role in determining susceptibility to 
Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs). However, much of the mechanistic 
work examining CDIs in mouse models uses animals obtained from a single source. 
We treated mice from 6 sources (2 University of Michigan colonies and 4 
commercial vendors) with clindamycin, followed by a C. difficile challenge, and 
then measured C. difficile colonization levels throughout the infection. The 
microbiota were profiled via 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the variation 
across sources and alterations due to clindamycin treatment and C. difficile 
challenge. While all mice were colonized 1 day postinfection, variation emerged 
from days 3 to 7 postinfection with animals from some sources colonized with C. 
difficile for longer and at higher levels. We identified bacteria that varied in 
relative abundance across sources and throughout the experiment. Some bacteria 
were consistently impacted by clindamycin treatment in all sources of mice, 
including Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae To identify 
bacteria that were most important to colonization regardless of the source, we 
created logistic regression models that successfully classified mice based on 
whether they cleared C. difficile by 7 days postinfection using community 
composition data at baseline, post-clindamycin treatment, and 1 day 
postinfection. With these models, we identified 4 bacterial taxa that were 
predictive of whether C. difficile cleared. They varied across sources 
(Bacteroides) or were altered by clindamycin (Porphyromonadaceae) or both 
(Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus). Allowing for microbiota variation across 
sources better emulates human interindividual variation and can help identify 
bacterial drivers of phenotypic variation in the context of CDIs.IMPORTANCE 
Clostridioides difficile is a leading nosocomial infection. Although 
perturbation to the gut microbiota is an established risk, there is variation in 
who becomes asymptomatically colonized, develops an infection, or has adverse 
infection outcomes. Mouse models of C. difficile infection (CDI) are widely used 
to answer a variety of C. difficile pathogenesis questions. However, the 
interindividual variation between mice from the same breeding facility is less 
than what is observed in humans. Therefore, we challenged mice from 6 different 
breeding colonies with C. difficile We found that the starting microbial 
community structures and C. difficile persistence varied by the source of mice. 
Interestingly, a subset of the bacteria that varied across sources were 
associated with how long C. difficile was able to colonize. By increasing the 
interindividual diversity of the starting communities, we were able to better 
model human diversity. This provided a more nuanced perspective of C. difficile 
pathogenesis.

induced by inhibition of Rac GTPase activity.

In several neuronal cell types, the small GTPase Rac is essential for survival. 
We have shown previously that the Rho family GTPase inhibitor Clostridium 
difficile toxin B (ToxB) induces apoptosis in primary rat cerebellar granule 
neurons (CGNs) principally via inhibition of Rac GTPase function. In the present 
study, incubation with ToxB activated a proapoptotic Janus kinase (JAK)/signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and a pan-JAK 
inhibitor protected CGNs from Rac inhibition. STAT1 expression was induced by 
ToxB; however, CGNs from STAT1 knock-out mice succumbed to ToxB-induced 
apoptosis as readily as wild-type CGNs. STAT3 displayed enhanced tyrosine 
phosphorylation following treatment with ToxB, and a reputed inhibitor of STAT3, 
cucurbitacin (JSI-124), reduced CGN apoptosis. Unexpectedly, JSI-124 failed to 
block STAT3 phosphorylation, and CGNs were not protected from ToxB by other 
known STAT3 inhibitors. In contrast, STAT5A tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 
ToxB was suppressed by JSI-124. In addition, roscovitine similarly inhibited 
STAT5A phosphorylation and protected CGNs from ToxB-induced apoptosis. 
Consistent with these results, adenoviral infection with a dominant negative 
STAT5 mutant, but not wild-type STAT5, significantly decreased ToxB-induced 
apoptosis of CGNs. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation with a STAT5 antibody 
revealed increased STAT5 binding to the promoter region of prosurvival Bcl-xL. 
STAT5 was recruited to the Bcl-xL promoter region in a ToxB-dependent manner, 
and this DNA binding preceded Bcl-xL down-regulation, suggesting transcriptional 
repression. These data indicate that a novel JAK/STAT5 proapoptotic pathway 
significantly contributes to neuronal apoptosis induced by the inhibition of Rac 
GTPase.

release of polyamines.

Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast widely used in humans for the prevention and 
treatment of infectious enteritis and Clostridium difficile-associated 
enterocolopathies. After oral administration to human volunteers or growing 
rats, S. boulardii enhances markedly the expression of intestinal enzymes as 
well as the production of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor by mechanisms 
that remain unknown. We have analyzed the role of the yeast polyamines as 
potential mediators in the intestinal trophic response. In weanling rats (d 20 
to d 30), a daily dose of 100 mg of lyophilized S. boulardii produced 
significant (p < 0.025) increases in sucrase (157%) and maltase (47%) 
activities. This dose corresponded to a total oral load of 678 nmol of 
polyamines per day (spermidine; 376 +/- 32, spermine: 293 +/- 26, putrescine: 
9.5 +/- 1.4 nmol/100 mg). Spermine, given orally to growing rats at doses nearly 
equivalent (500 nmol) to the load of polyamines provided by the yeast (678 
nmol), reproduced similar enzymatic changes, including a 2.5-fold induction of 
sucrase, and enhanced maltase activity (+24%). Spermidine and spermine 
concentrations measured in the jejunal mucosa of treated rats were increased 
over matched controls by 21.4% (p < 0.005) and 21.9%, respectively (p < 0.002). 
After being centrifuged and filtered to discard residual yeast cells, 2-mL 
samples of jejunal and ileal fluid collected from S. boulardii-treated rats by 
intestinal flushing contained higher levels of spermidine (48 and 60%) and 
spermine (150 and 316%) than did control rats. Our data indicate that 
lyophilized S. boulardii exerts trophic effects on the small intestine that are 
likely mediated by the endoluminal release of spermine and spermidine.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortins (Ucn) bind with various 
affinities to two G-protein-coupled receptors, CRHR1 and CRHR2, which are 
expressed in brain and in peripheral tissues, including immune cells. 
CRHR2-deficient mice display anxiety-like behavior, hypersensitivity to stress, 
altered feeding behavior and metabolism, and cardiovascular abnormalities. 
However, the phenotype of these mice in inflammatory responses has not been 
determined. In the present study we found that compared with wild-type 
CRHR2-null mice developed substantially reduced intestinal inflammation and had 
lower intestinal mRNA expression of the potent chemoattractants keratinocyte 
chemokine and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 following intraluminal exposure 
to Clostridium difficile toxin A, a potent enterotoxin that mediates 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in humans. This effect was 
recapitulated by administration of astressin 2B, a selective CRHR2 antagonist, 
before toxin A exposure. Moreover, Ab array analysis revealed reduced expression 
of several inflammatory chemokines, including keratinocyte chemokine and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in toxin A-exposed mice pretreated with 
astressin 2B. Real-time RT-PCR of wild-type mouse intestine showed that only 
UcnII, but not other Ucn, was significantly up-regulated by ileal administration 
of toxin A at 4 h compared with buffer exposure. We also found that human 
colonic epithelial HT-29 cells express CRHR2alpha mRNA, whereas expression of 
beta and gamma spliced variants was minimal. Moreover, treatment of HT-29 cells 
with UcnII, which binds exclusively to CRHR2, stimulated expression of IL-8 and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. Taken together, these results provide direct 
evidence that CRHR2 mediates intestinal inflammatory responses via release of 
proinflammatory mediators at the colonocyte level.

BACKGROUND: Around 15%-30% of patients develop recurrent Clostridioides 
difficile infection (CDI) as conventional therapies disrupt protective gut 
microbiota. We tested if supplementation with a spore-forming probiotic would 
protect intestinal health in a mouse model of recurrent CD colonization.
METHODS: Methods: Female CF-1 mice were exposed to CD spores (4-log10 
colony-forming units/10 μL) and then randomly assigned to receive either saline 
(CD-S) or probiotic (CD-PRO). Control mice received only saline (control). 
Following confirmation of initial CD colonization, mice were treated with 
vancomycin (10 days). After 5 days, mice recolonized with CD were treated again 
with vancomycin (10 days) and euthanized 5 days later. Fecal samples were 
collected at select time points for bacterial analysis. Following euthanasia, 
blood samples, cecum contents, and the intestine were collected for analysis.
RESULTS: Probiotic supplementation mitigated the antibiotic-induced changes in 
cecum weight (P < .001). Probiotic-supplemented mice had increased messenger RNA 
expression of several immune parameters, accompanied by lower serum iron levels 
compared with CD-S mice (P < .05). Lower expressions of TNF α and calprotectin 
(P ≤ .05) were observed in CD-PRO mice compared with CD-S. The probiotics also 
supported the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins, which were 
diminished in the proximal colon of CD-S mice (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Mice supplemented with targeted spore-forming probiotics exhibited 
improved immune responses and nutrition immunity properties, which were linked 
with less inflammation and enhanced intestinal barrier proteins during recurrent 
CD colonization.

BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota protect the host against enteric pathogens 
through a defense mechanism termed colonization resistance. Antibiotics excreted 
into the intestinal tract may disrupt colonization resistance and alter normal 
metabolic functions of the microbiota. We used a mouse model to test the 
hypothesis that alterations in levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal 
specimens could provide useful biomarkers indicating disrupted or intact 
colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment.
METHODS: To assess in vivo colonization resistance, mice were challenged with 
oral vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus or Clostridium difficile spores at 
varying time points after treatment with the lincosamide antibiotic clindamycin. 
For concurrent groups of antibiotic-treated mice, stool samples were analyzed 
using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in the 
microbiota and using non-targeted metabolic profiling. To assess whether the 
findings were applicable to another antibiotic class that suppresses intestinal 
anaerobes, similar experiments were conducted with piperacillin/tazobactam.
RESULTS: Colonization resistance began to recover within 5 days and was intact 
by 12 days after clindamycin treatment, coinciding with the recovery bacteria 
from the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, both part of the phylum 
Firmicutes. Clindamycin treatment caused marked changes in metabolites present 
in fecal specimens. Of 484 compounds analyzed, 146 (30%) exhibited a significant 
increase or decrease in concentration during clindamycin treatment followed by 
recovery to baseline that coincided with restoration of in vivo colonization 
resistance. Identified as potential biomarkers of colonization resistance, these 
compounds included intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that 
increased (pentitols, gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites) or 
decreased (pentoses, dipeptides) with clindamycin treatment. 
Piperacillin/tazobactam treatment caused similar alterations in the intestinal 
microbiota and fecal metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment 
coincided with restoration of several fecal bacterial metabolites. These 
metabolites could provide useful biomarkers indicating intact or disrupted 
colonization resistance during and after antibiotic treatment.

Signalling components involved in the coupling of alpha 1-adrenoceptors to 
phospholipase D in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.

Activation of phospholipase D (PLD) is assumed to be one major pathway by which 
alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (alpha(1)ARs) induce hypertrophic responses in cardiac 
myocytes. Heterotrimeric G proteins, protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, protein 
tyrosine kinases, monomeric GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and Rho 
families, and as important cofactor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
(PIP(2)) seem to participate in the G protein-coupled receptor dependent 
regulation of PLD. We therefore studied the role of these components in the 
coupling of alpha(1)ARs to PLD in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM). 
Stimulation of alpha(1)ARs, most likely of the alpha(1A) subtype, by 
noradrenaline increased PLD activity three- to fourfold concomitant with the 
stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC). In contrast, the partial agonist 
phenylephrine stimulated PLC, but failed to increase PLD activity. The PLC and 
PLD responses were pertussis toxin insensitive and treatment of the cells with 
the G(q)-activating toxin of Pasteurella multocida stimulated both 
phospholipases about fourfold. Over-expression of the G(q)-and 
G(i)-type-specific regulator of G protein signalling RGS4 blunted 
alpha(1)AR-induced PLC and PLD stimulation. Ro 31-8220, known to inhibit 
Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent PKC isoforms, strongly inhibited PLD activity, 
whereas Gö 6976, known to inhibit preferentially Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isozymes, 
was without effect. The ARF signalling inhibitor brefeldin A, protein tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors and the Rho-inactivating toxin B of Clostridium difficile 
blunted alpha(1)AR-induced PLD stimulation and largely reduced the cellular 
PIP(2) content. In membranes of toxin B-treated NCRM, PLD activity was similarly 
reduced, but was fully restored by addition of exogenous PIP(2). We conclude, 
that alpha(1A)ARs stimulate PLD activity via a G(q/11)-PLCbeta-novel PKC 
isoform-dependent pathway in NRCM. ARF and Rho GTPases as well as protein 
tyrosine kinases contribute to PLD stimulation in NRCM, most likely by 
regulating the supply of PIP(2).

School, Boston 02115.

Mucosal sheets of guinea pig ileum mounted in Ussing chambers were used to 
determine effects of highly purified Clostridium difficile toxin A on intestinal 
structure and barrier function in the absence of recruited neutrophils and blood 
flow. With the use of standard electrophysiological and morphological 
techniques, our results indicate that 5 micrograms/ml mucosal toxin A induces 
substantial alteration in epithelial permeability and in structure of absorptive 
cells. Transepithelial fluxes of mannitol (3.6 A) and inulin (11.5 A) increased 
20-80 min after toxin A exposure (63 +/- 13 vs. 149 +/- 14 and 2.33 +/- 0.43 vs. 
7.03 +/- 1.0 nmol.cm-2.h-1 for mannitol and inulin; controls vs. toxin exposed, 
respectively, both P less than 0.01). Toxin A exposure diminished short-circuit 
current (153 +/- 8 vs. 77 +/- 6 microA/cm2 for control and toxin exposed, 
respectively, P less than 0.001), decreased transepithelial electrical 
resistance (61.6 +/- 3 vs. 50.1 +/- 3.9 omega.cm2 for control and toxin exposed, 
respectively, P less than 0.05), increased passive permeation of Na+ (19.1 +/- 
0.9 vs. 27.4 +/- 0.9 mumol.cm-2.h-1 for control and toxin exposed, 
respectively), and induced a Cl- secretory response (net flux 3.65 +/- 3.0 vs.

structural alterations of villus tip absorptive cells were strikingly similar to 
those induced by the actin-binding agent cytochalasin D. Specifically, cells 
displayed constricted subjunctional zones, flared microvillus brush borders, 
condensation of microfilaments in the zone of the perijunctional actomyosin 
ring, and breakdown of intercellular tight junctions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) is the leading infectious cause 
of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in the United States. Both the 
incidence and severity of CDAD have been increased over the past two decades. We 
evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicokinetics of OG253, a novel 
lantibiotic in development for the treatment of CDAD. OG253 was orally 
administered to Wistar Han rats as enteric-coated capsules in a one-day dose 
escalation study, followed by a seven-day repeated dose toxicokinetics study. 
All three doses of OG253 (6.75, 27 and 108 mg/day) were generally well-tolerated 
with no treatment-related clinical signs, alterations in body weight or food 
consumption in both one-day acute tolerability and seven-days repeated dose 
tolerability and toxicokinetics study. OG253 capsule administration neither 
significantly alter the weight of organs nor affect the hematology, coagulation, 
clinical biochemistry parameters and urine pH compared to placebo capsule 
administered rats. LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect OG253 in the plasma, 
indicating that OG253 is not absorbed into the blood from the rat 
gastrointestinal tract. Glandular atrophy of the rectal mucosa was noticed in 
two out of six rats administered with a high dose of OG253. Surprisingly, we 
found that OG253 treatment significantly lowered both serum cholesterol and 
triglyceride levels in both sexes of rats. Overall, there was a 29.8 and 61.38% 
decrease in the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, respectively as 
compared to placebo-treated rats. The well-tolerated high dose of OG253 
(425.7 mg/kg/day) is recommended as the MTD for safety and efficacy studies. 
Further preclinical study is needed to evaluate the safety profile of OG253 
under longer exposure.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can result in severe disease and death, 
with no accurate models that allow for early prediction of adverse outcomes. To 
address this need, we sought to develop serum-based biomarker models to predict 
CDI outcomes. We prospectively collected sera ≤48 h after diagnosis of CDI in 
two cohorts. Biomarkers were measured with a custom multiplex bead array assay. 
Patients were classified using IDSA severity criteria and the development of 
disease-related complications (DRCs), which were defined as ICU admission, 
colectomy, and/or death attributed to CDI. Unadjusted and adjusted models were 
built using logistic and elastic net modeling. The best model for severity 
included procalcitonin (PCT) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with an area 
(AUC) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.74 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.81). The best model for 30-day mortality included 
interleukin-8 (IL-8), PCT, CXCL-5, IP-10, and IL-2Rα with an AUC of 0.89 (0.84 
to 0.95). The best model for DRCs included IL-8, procalcitonin, HGF, and IL-2Rα 
with an AUC of 0.84 (0.73 to 0.94). To validate our models, we employed 
experimental infection of mice with C. difficile Antibiotic-treated mice were 
challenged with C. difficile and a similar panel of serum biomarkers was 
measured. Applying each model to the mouse cohort of severe and nonsevere CDI 
revealed AUCs of 0.59 (0.44 to 0.74), 0.96 (0.90 to 1.0), and 0.89 (0.81 to 
0.97). In both human and murine CDI, models based on serum biomarkers predicted 
adverse CDI outcomes. Our results support the use of serum-based biomarker 
panels to inform Clostridioides difficile infection treatment.IMPORTANCE Each 
year in the United States, Clostridioides difficile causes nearly 500,000 
gastrointestinal infections that range from mild diarrhea to severe colitis and 
death. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for severe disease or 
mortality at the time of diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI) would allow 
clinicians to effectively allocate disease modifying therapies. In this study, 
we developed models consisting of only a small number of serum biomarkers that 
are capable of predicting both 30-day all-cause mortality and adverse outcomes 
of patients at time of CDI diagnosis. We were able to validate these models 
through experimental mouse infection. This provides evidence that the biomarkers 
reflect the underlying pathophysiology and that our mouse model of CDI reflects 
the pathogenesis of human infection. Predictive models can not only assist 
clinicians in identifying patients at risk for severe CDI but also be utilized 
for targeted enrollment in clinical trials aimed at reduction of adverse 
outcomes from severe CDI.

The relevance of large clostridial toxin-negative, binary toxin-producing 
(A-B-CDT+) Clostridium difficile strains in human infection is still 
controversial. In this study, we investigated putative virulence traits that may 
contribute to the role of A-B-CDT+C. difficile strains in idiopathic diarrhea. 
Phenotypic assays were conducted on 148 strains of C. difficile comprising 10 
different A-B-CDT+C. difficile ribotypes (RTs): 033, 238, 239, 288, 585, 586, 
QX143, QX444, QX521 and QX629. A subset of these isolates (n = 53) was 
whole-genome sequenced to identify genetic loci associated with virulence and 
survival. Motility studies showed that with the exception of RT 239 all RTs 
tested were non-motile. C. difficile RTs 033 and 288 had deletions in the F2 and 
F3 regions of their flagella operon while the F2 region was absent from strains 
of RTs 238, 585, 586, QX143, QX444, QX521 and QX629. The flagellin and flagella 
cap genes, fliC and fliD, respectively, involved in adherence and host 
colonization, were conserved in all strains, including reference strains. All 
A-B-CDT+C. difficile strains produced at least three extracellular enzymes 
(deoxyribonuclease, esterase and mucinase) indicating that these are important 
extracellular proteins. The toxicity of A-B-CDT+C. difficile strains in Vero 
cells was confirmed, however, pathogenicity was not demonstrated in a mouse 
model of disease. Despite successful colonization by most strains, there was no 
evidence of disease in mice. This study provides the first in-depth analysis of 
A-B-CDT+C. difficile strains and contributes to the current limited knowledge of 
these strains as a cause of C. difficile infection.

Dietary or supplemental fermentable fiber intake reduces the presence of 
Clostridium XI in mouse intestinal microbiota: The importance of higher fecal 
bacterial load and density.

OBJECTIVES: Clostridium difficile infection is a public health concern. C. 
difficile was found in healthy human intestine as a member of Clostridium XI. 
Because soluble fermentable fiber ingestion affects intestinal microbiota, we 
used fiber-containing diets to determine the intestinal microbial condition that 
could reduce the presence of Clostridium XI.
METHODS: Newly weaned male mice were assigned to three published diets: Control 
AIN-93G purified diet with only poorly fermented cellulose; Control plus 5% 
purified fermentable fiber inulin; Chow with wheat, soybean and corn that 
provide a mixture of unpurified dietary fibers. Methods were developed to 
quantify 24-hour fecal microbial load and microbial DNA density. The relative 
abundance of bacterial genera and the bacterial diversity were determined 
through 16S rRNA sequence-based fecal microbiota analysis.
RESULTS: Mice adjusted food intake to maintain the same energy intake and body 
weight under these three moderate-fat (7% w:w) diets. Chow-feeding led to higher 
food intake but also higher 24-h fecal output. Chow-feeding and 1-8 wk ingestion 
of inulin-supplemented diet increased daily fecal microbial load and density 
along with lowering the prevalence of Clostridium XI to undetectable. 
Clostridium XI remained undetectable until 4 weeks after the termination of 
inulin-supplemented diet. Fermentable fiber intake did not consistently increase 
probiotic genera such as Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus. Chow feeding, but not 
inulin supplementation, increased the bacterial diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: Increase fecal microbial load/density upon fermentable fiber 
ingestion is associated with a lower and eventually undetectable presence of 
Clostridium XI. Higher bacterial diversity or abundance of particular genera is 
not apparently essential. Future studies are needed to see whether this 
observation can be translated into the reduction of C. difficile at the species 
level in at-risk populations.

Intraluminal administration of the endocannabinoids N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine 
(anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) causes inflammation similar to 
that caused by Clostridium difficile toxin A in the rat ileum. The effects of 
anandamide and 2-AG were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the 
specific capsaicin receptor (vanilloid receptor subtype 1; VR1) antagonist 
capsazepine. Pretreatment with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor antagonists 
N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazole-carboxamide 
(SR141716) and 
N-[1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide 
(SR144528) did not affect the responses to anandamide. It has previously been 
shown that intraluminal toxin A stimulates substance P (SP) release from primary 
sensory neurons and that pretreatment with SP receptor [neurokinin (NK)-1 
receptor] antagonists inhibits the inflammatory effects of toxin A. Anandamide 
stimulated SP release and this was blocked by capsazepine pretreatment. Also, 
pretreatment with the specific NK-1 receptor antagonist 
(2S,3S)-3-([3,5-bis[trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine 
(L-733,060) significantly inhibited the inflammatory effects of both toxin A and 
anandamide. Toxin A increased tissue concentrations of anandamide and 2-AG in 
the ileum, and these effects were enhanced after pretreatment with inhibitors of 
fatty acid amide hydrolase, a major endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme. The toxin 
A-stimulated release of anandamide but not 2-AG was selective over their 
congeners. These results demonstrate that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 
2-AG stimulate intestinal primary sensory neurons via the capsaicin VR1 receptor 
to release SP, resulting in enteritis, and that endocannabinoids may mediate the 
inflammatory effects of toxin A.

Changes in the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development 
of immune-mediated diseases in humans. Additionally, the introduction of defined 
bacterial species into the mouse intestinal microbiota has been shown to impact 
on the adaptive immune response. However, how much impact the intestinal 
microbiota composition actually has on regulating adaptive immunity remains 
poorly understood. Therefore, we studied aspects of the adaptive immunity in 
healthy adults possessing distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. The 
intestinal microbiota composition was determined via Illumina sequencing of 
bacterial 16S rRNA genes extracted from the feces of 35 individuals. Blood 
B-cell and T-cell subsets from the same individuals were studied using flow 
cytometry. Finally, the binding of fecal and plasma Immunoglobulin A (IgA) to 
intestinal bacteria (associated with health and disease) Bacteroides fragilis, 
Prevotella copri, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia 
coli was analyzed using ELISA. Unsupervised clustering of microbiota composition 
revealed the presence of three clusters within the cohort. Cluster 1 and 2 were 
similar to previously-described enterotypes with a predominance of Bacteroides 
in Cluster 1 and Prevotella in Cluster 2. The bacterial diversity (Shannon 
index) and bacterial richness of Cluster 3 was significantly higher than 
observed in Clusters 1 and 2, with the Ruminococacceae tending to predominate. 
Within circulating B- and T-cell subsets, only Th subsets were significantly 
different between groups of distinct intestinal microbiota. Individuals of 
Cluster 3 have significantly fewer Th17 and Th22 circulating cells, while Th17.1 
cell numbers were increased in individuals of Cluster 1. IgA reactivity to 
intestinal bacteria was higher in plasma than feces, and individuals of Cluster 
1 had significant higher plasma IgA reactivity against B. longum than 
individuals of Cluster 2. In conclusion, we identified three distinct fecal 
microbiota clusters, of which two clusters resembled previously-described 
"enterotypes". Global T-cell and B-cell immunity seemed unaffected, however, 
circulating Th subsets and plasma IgA reactivity were significantly different 
between Clusters. Hence, the impact of intestinal bacteria composition on human 
B cells, T cells and IgA reactivity appears limited in genetically-diverse and 
environmentally-exposed humans, but can skew antibody reactivity and Th cell 
subsets.

Prolonged depletion of guanosine triphosphate induces death of insulin-secreting 
cells by apoptosis.

Inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase, such as mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mizoribine, 
which deplete cellular GTP, are used clinically as immunosuppressive drugs. The 
prolonged effect of such agents on insulin-secreting beta-cells (HIT-T15 and 
INS-1) was investigated. Both MPA and mizoribine inhibited mitogenesis, as 
reflected by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cell number, DNA and protein contents, 
and cell (metabolic) viability were decreased by about 30%, 60%, and 80% after 
treatment of HIT cells with clinically relevant concentrations (e.g. 1 
microg/ml) of MPA for 1, 2, and 4 days, respectively. Mizoribine (48 h) 
similarly induced the death of HIT cells. INS-1 cells also were damaged by 
prolonged MPA treatment. MPA-treated HIT cells displayed a strong and localized 
staining with a DNA-binding dye (propidium iodide), suggesting condensation and 
fragmentation of DNA, which were confirmed by detection of DNA laddering in 
multiples of about 180 bp. DNA fragmentation was observed after 24-h MPA 
treatment and was dose dependent (29%, 49%, and 70% of cells were affected after 
48-h exposure to 1, 3, and 10 microg/ml MPA, respectively). Examination of 
MPA-treated cells by electron microscopy revealed typical signs of apoptosis: 
condensed and marginated chromatin, apoptotic bodies, cytosolic vacuolization, 
and loss of microvilli. MPA-induced cell death was almost totally prevented by 
supplementation with guanosine, but not with adenosine or deoxyguanosine, 
indicating a specific effect of GTP depletion. An inhibitor of protein 
isoprenylation (lovastatin, 10-100 microM for 2-3 days) induced cell death and 
DNA degradation similar to those induced by sustained GTP depletion, suggesting 
a mediatory role of posttranslationally modified GTP-binding proteins. Indeed, 
impeding the function of G proteins of the Rho family (via glucosylation using 
Clostridium difficile toxin B), although not itself inducing apoptosis, 
potentiated cell death induced by MPA or lovastatin. These findings indicate 
that prolonged depletion of GTP induces beta-cell death compatible with 
apoptosis; this probably involves a direct impairment of GTP-dependent 
RNA-primed DNA synthesis, but also appears to be modulated by small GTP-binding 
proteins. Treatment of intact adult rat islets (the beta-cells of which 
replicate slowly) induced a modest, but definite, death by apoptosis over 1- to 
3-day periods. Thus, more prolonged use of the new generation of 
immunosuppressive agents exemplified by MPA might have deleterious effects on 
the survival of islet or pancreas grafts.

Angiotensin II and epidermal growth factor induce cyclooxygenase-2 expression in 
intestinal epithelial cells through small GTPases using distinct signaling 
pathways.

Colorectal carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving genetic mutations and 
alterations in rigorously controlled signaling pathways and gene expression that 
control intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and 
apoptosis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is aberrantly expressed in premalignant 
adenomatous polyps and colorectal carcinomas and is associated with increased 
epithelial cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and increased cell 
invasiveness. Currently, knowledge of the regulation of expression of COX-2 by 
endogenous cell-surface receptors is inadequate. Recently, in a non-transformed 
rat intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-18), we showed induction of cell 
proliferation and DNA synthesis by angiotensin II (Ang II) via the endogenous 
Ang II type 1 receptor (Chiu, T., Santiskulvong, C., and Rozengurt, E. (2003) 
Am. J. Physiol. 285, G1-G11). We report that Ang II potently stimulated 
expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein as an immediate-early gene response through 
the Ang II type 1 receptor, correlating with an increase in prostaglandin I2 
production. Ang II induced Cdc42 activation and filopodial formation. COX-2 
expression was induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF), which activated Rac 
with lamellipodial formation. Inhibition of small GTPases by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B blocked COX-2 expression by Ang II and EGF. Inhibition of ERK 
activation by U0126 or PD98059 significantly decreased EGF-dependent COX-2 
expression, but did not affect Ang II-dependent COX-2 expression. Conversely, 
inhibition of p38MAPK by SB202190 or PD169316 inhibited COX-2 expression by Ang 
II, but did not block COX-2 induction by EGF. Ang II caused Ca2+ mobilization. 
Inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by 2-aminobiphenyl borate blocked Ang II-dependent 
COX-2 expression. EGF did not induce Ca2+ mobilization, and 2-aminobiphenyl 
borate did not inhibit EGF-dependent COX-2 expression. Inhibition of COX-2 
expression correlated with inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production. Luciferase 
promoter assays showed that Ang II-dependent transcriptional activation of the 
COX-2 promoter was dependent on activation of small GTPases and p38(MAPK) and on 
Ca2+ signaling via the cAMP-responsive element/activating transcription factor 
cis-acting element.
