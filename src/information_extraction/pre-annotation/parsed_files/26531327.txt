Salmonella typhimurium is a major cause of diarrhea and causes significant 
morbidity and mortality worldwide, and perturbations of the gut microbiota are 
known to increase susceptibility to enteric infections. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate whether a Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic (MET-1) 
consisting of 33 bacterial strains, isolated from human stool and previously 
used to cure patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, could also 
protect against S. typhimurium disease. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with 
streptomycin prior to receiving MET-1 or control, then gavaged with S. 
typhimurium. Weight loss, serum cytokine levels, and S. typhimurium splenic 
translocation were measured. NF-κB nuclear staining, neutrophil accumulation, 
and localization of tight junction proteins (claudin-1, ZO-1) were visualized by 
immunofluorescence. Infected mice receiving MET-1 lost less weight, had reduced 
serum cytokines, reduced NF-κB nuclear staining, and decreased neutrophil 
infiltration in the cecum. MET-1 also preserved cecum tight junction protein 
expression, and reduced S. typhimurium translocation to the spleen. Notably, 
MET-1 did not decrease CFUs of Salmonella in the intestine. MET-1 may attenuate 
systemic infection by preserving tight junctions, thereby inhibiting S. 
typhimurium from gaining access to the systemic circulation. We conclude that 
MET-1 may be protective against enteric infections besides C. difficile 
infection.
