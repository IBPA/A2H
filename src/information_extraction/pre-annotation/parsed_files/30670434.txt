Lantibiotics present an attractive scaffold for the development of novel 
antibiotics. We report here a novel lantibiotic for the treatment of Clostridium 
difficile infection. The lead compounds were selected from a library of over 700 
single- and multiple-substitution variants of the lantibiotic mutacin 1140 
(MU1140). The best performers in vitro and in vivo were further used to 
challenge Golden Syrian hamsters orally in a Golden Syrian hamster model of 
Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) in a dose-response format, 
resulting in the selection of OG716 as the lead compound. This lantibiotic was 
characterized by a 50% effective dose of 23.85 mg/kg of body weight/day (10.97 
μmol/kg/day) in this model. Upon oral administration of the maximum feasible 
dose (≥1,918 mg/kg/day), no observable toxicities or side effects were noted, 
and no effect on intestinal motility was observed. Compartmentalization to the 
gastrointestinal tract was confirmed. MU1140-derived variants offer a large 
pipeline for the development of novel antibiotics for the treatment of several 
indications and are particularly attractive considering their novel mechanism of 
action. Based on the currently available data, OG716 has an acceptable profile 
for further development for the treatment of CDAD.
