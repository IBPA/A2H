BACKGROUND AND AIM: Prompted by an article describing a dog trained to detect 
Clostridium difficile in patients, our institution evaluated a dog's ability to 
detect C. difficile scent from equipment and surfaces to assist in strategic 
deployment of adjunctive cleaning measures.
METHODS: An expert in drug and explosives scent dog handling trained a canine to 
identify odours from pure cultures and/or faecal specimens positive for 
C. difficile. Methods used to assess explosive and drug detection dogs were 
adapted and included evaluation of (i) odour recognition, using containers 
positive and negative for the scent of C. difficile, and of (ii) search 
capability, on a simulation ward with hidden scents. After demonstration that 
the canine could accurately and reliably detect the scent of C. difficile, 
formal assessments of all clinical areas began.
FINDINGS: Odour recognition (N = 75 containers) had a sensitivity of 100% and 
specificity of 97%. Search capability was 80% sensitive and 92.9% specific after 
removal of results from one room where dog and trainer fatigue influenced 
performance. Both odour recognition and search capability had an overall 
sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 95.4%. The clinical unit sweeps over a 
period of five months revealed a sensitivity of 100% in alerting on positive 
quality control hides. These clinical unit sweeps also resulted in 83 alerts 
during 49 sweep days.
CONCLUSION: A dog can be trained to accurately and reliably detect C. difficile 
odour from environmental sources to guide the best deployment of adjunctive 
cleaning measures and can be successfully integrated into a quality infection 
control programme.
