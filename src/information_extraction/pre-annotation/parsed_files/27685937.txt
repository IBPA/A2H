Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic- and 
healthcare-associated diarrhea. CXCL13 is a well-known CXC chemokine involved in 
inflammation, but its role in CDI remains unknown. In this study, serum and 
fecal samplings were collected from 51 CDI patients, 50 diarrhea patients 
without CDI and 50 healthy control subjects to determine the CXCL13 levels by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Besides, a mouse model of C. 
difficile infection was established, and murine serum and colon tissues were 
collected for detection of CXCL13 expression using quantitative real-time 
RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot, or immunohistochemistry. We found that CXCL13 
concentration in serum and fecal samples from CDI patients was significantly 
higher compared with that from diarrhea patients without CDI and that from 
healthy controls. Elevated serum CXCL13 positively and significantly correlated 
with blood markers of inflammation and yielded an increased area under the ROC 
curve of 0.929. In murine C. difficile infection, CXCL13 were also dramatically 
increased in serum and infected colon tissues at the transcriptional and protein 
levels. The elevated CXCL13 levels positively and significantly correlated with 
inflammatory scores. Therefore, CDI is associated with enhanced release of 
CXCL13. This study indicated that CXCL13 may be pathogenically involved in CDI 
and served as a potential new biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in CDI.
