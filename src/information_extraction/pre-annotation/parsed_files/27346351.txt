Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of 
hospital-acquired infection in the United States. Host susceptibility and the 
severity of infection are influenced by disruption of the microbiota and the 
immune response. However, how the microbiota regulate immune responses to 
mediate CDI outcome remains unclear. Here, we have investigated the role of the 
microbiota-linked cytokine IL-25 during infection. Intestinal IL-25 was 
suppressed during CDI in humans and mice. Restoration of IL-25 reduced 
CDI-associated mortality and tissue pathology even though equivalent levels of 
C.Â difficile bacteria and toxin remained in the gut. IL-25 protection was 
mediated by gut eosinophils, as demonstrated by an increase in intestinal 
eosinophils and a loss of IL-25 protection upon eosinophil depletion. These 
findings support a mechanism whereby the induction of IL-25-mediated 
eosinophilia can reduce host mortality during active CDI. This work may provide 
targets for future development of microbial or immune-based therapies.
