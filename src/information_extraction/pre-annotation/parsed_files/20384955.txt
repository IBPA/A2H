BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a recognized cause of 
colitis in the horse. Identification of its toxins is important for management 
of individual cases and for prevention of transmission and zoonosis. In humans, 
CDI diagnosis is performed with enzyme immunoassays, none of which have been 
validated for horses.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: (1) Establish which test for CDI diagnosis was more 
frequently used by diagnostic laboratories, (2) determine the identified test's 
performance, sensitivity, and specificity, and (3) validate its use in diarrheic 
horses.
ANIMALS: Samples were obtained from 72 horses presented with acute diarrhea and 
hospitalized at the Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph.
METHODS: A survey was conducted to establish which of the tests for CDI 
diagnosis in horses is most commonly used throughout North America. A 
questionnaire was sent to all laboratories registered in the Veterinary 
Infection Control Society and the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory 
Diagnosticians. The performance of the test was evaluated by comparison to a 
cell cytotoxicity assay (CTA), the accepted Gold Standard for C. difficile toxin 
detection.
RESULTS: The Techlab C. difficile Tox A/B II ELISA was the most frequently used 
test. Compared with the CTA, no significant difference was observed, and a good 
level of agreement (93%) was obtained. The diagnostic performance of the ELISA 
test was adequate (84% sensitivity and 96% specificity).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results demonstrate that the Techlab C. 
difficile Tox A/B II ELISA is a reliable, adequate, and practical tool for 
identification of C. difficile toxins in horse feces.
