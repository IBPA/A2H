The three clostridial cytotoxins, i.e. alpha-toxin of C. novyi (Tox alpha-nov), 
toxin B of C. difficile (ToxB-dif) and lethal toxin of C. sordellii (LT-sor) 
consist of single peptide chains of about 200,000 (Tox alpha-nov), 250,000 
(LT-sor) and 275,000 (ToxB-dif) mol. wts. ToxB-dif and LT-sor but not Tox 
alpha-nov cross-reacted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Toxicity upon i.v. 
injection in mice was similar (LD50, 100 hr, 50-200 ng/kg) and was characterized 
by a slowly developing fluid loss into the interstitial space. When injected 
into the rat paw the toxins caused a delayed local edema lasting for days. In 
vitro the three toxins provoked a persistent retraction of endothelial cells 
cultured from pig pulmonary artery. ToxB-dif and Tox alpha-nov triggered the 
accumulation of F-actin in the perinuclear region at the expense of the tight 
peripheral bands whereas LT-sor led to a random loss of microfilament structure. 
The toxins inhibited uridine incorporation into endothelial or chicken embryonic 
cells whereas T 84 cells responded by an about 10-fold increase of uridine 
incorporation. Neither toxin ADP-ribosylated actin. The similarities between the 
three cytotoxins warrant their arrangement into a common group which perturbs 
the microfilament system.
