Deficiency of leptin (ob/ob) and/or desensitization of leptin signaling (db/db) 
and elevated expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) reported 
in obesity are also reported in a variety of pathologies including 
hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and malnutrition as the risk factors 
in host defense system. Viral infections cause the elevated SOCS3 expression, 
which inhibits leptin signaling. It results in immunosuppression by T-regulatory 
cells (Tregs). The host immunity becomes incompetent to manage pathogens' attack 
and invasion, which results in the accelerated infections and diminished 
vaccine-specific antibody response. Leptin was successfully used as mucosal 
vaccine adjuvant against Rhodococcus equi. Leptin induced the antibody response 
to Helicobacter pylori vaccination in mice. An integral leptin signaling in 
mucosal gut epithelial cells offered resistance against Clostridium difficile 
and Entameoba histolytica infections. We present in this review, the 
intervention of leptin in lethal diseases caused by microbial infections and 
propose the possible scope and challenges of leptin as an adjuvant tool in the 
development of effective vaccines.
