The objective of this study was to undertake a microbiological survey of foods, 
animal faeces and wastewater samples for Clostridium difficile, and determine 
the genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolates. A total of 211 
samples were tested for C. difficile using culture methods. Thirteen toxigenic 
C. difficile isolates were obtained; ten from wastewater samples, one each from 
pig and duck faeces and another from a raw meat product. Eight PCR-ribotypes 
(RTs) were identified, including two novel RTs (878 and 879). Single-nucleotide 
polymorphism analysis using WGS data for all isolates provided greater 
discrimination between C. difficile isolates within the same RT and multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST) profiles. All C. difficile isolates were found to be 
susceptible to the first-line human antimicrobials used to treat C. difficile 
infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to 
report the isolation of Clostridium difficile from animals, food and wastewater 
in New Zealand (NZ) and provides important data with respect to ribotypes and 
multilocus sequence typing profiles, whole genome sequence and antimicrobial 
susceptibilities. The results highlight the need for further investigations into 
the epidemiology of C. difficile in NZ and to elucidate the role of the 
environmental and food sources as transmission routes of human infection.
