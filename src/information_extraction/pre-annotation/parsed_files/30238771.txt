AIM: To evaluate the effect on the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
indomethacin on Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) severity.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Indomethacin was administered in two different mouse models 
of antibiotic-associated CDI in two different facilities, using a low and high 
dose of indomethacin.
RESULTS: Indomethacin administration caused weight loss, increased the signs of 
severe infection and worsened histopathological damage, leading to 100% 
mortality during CDI. Indomethacin-treated, antibiotic-exposed mice infected 
with C. difficile had enhanced intestinal inflammation with increased expression 
of KC, IL-1Î² and IL-22 compared with infected mice unexposed to indomethacin.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a negative impact of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs on antibiotic-associated CDI in mice and suggest that 
targeting the synthesis or signaling of prostaglandins might be an approach to 
ameliorating the severity of CDI.
