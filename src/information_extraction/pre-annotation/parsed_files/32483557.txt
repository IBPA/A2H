Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an enteric bacterial disease that is 
increasing in prevalence worldwide. C. difficile capitalizes on gut inflammation 
and microbiome dysbiosis to establish infection, with symptoms ranging from 
watery diarrhea to toxic megacolon. We reported that the safe-in-human clinical 
drug ebselen (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03013400, NCT01452607, NCT00762671, and 
NCT02603081) has biochemical, cell-based, and in vivo efficacy against the 
toxins of C. difficile. Here, we show that ebselen treatment reduces recurrence 
rates and decreases colitis in a hamster model of relapsing CDI. Furthermore, 
ebselen treatment does not alter microbiome diversity and promotes recovery back 
to that of healthy controls after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in healthy and C. 
difficile-infected mice. This increased microbiome recovery upon ebselen 
treatment correlates with a decrease in host-derived inflammatory markers, 
suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of ebselen, combined with its 
anti-toxin function, help to mitigate the major clinical challenges of CDI, 
including recurrence, microbial dysbiosis, and colitis.
