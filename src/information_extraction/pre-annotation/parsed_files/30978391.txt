Novel culture independent technologies have further elucidated the composition 
of the human mycobiome, though the role of fungi in human health and disease 
remains largely unknown. Recent studies have suggested conflicting roles for 
fungi in the gastrointestinal tract, underscoring the complexity of the 
interactions between the mycobiome, its bacterial counterpart, and the host. One 
key example is the observation that fungal taxa are overrepresented in patients 
with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), suggesting a role for fungi in 
this disease. Recent studies in murine models have demonstrated the ability of 
the commensal fungus Candida albicans to alter the course of CDI, supporting the 
notion that fungi play a role in this infection. This review summarizes current 
data on fungi and CDI, and shows that views of the dysbiotic state that is 
central to the pathogenesis of CDI are incomplete without consideration of the 
mycobiome.
