Pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile has been linked to production of toxins, 
including the large toxins A and B as well as the binary toxin CDT. Until 
recently, toxin A was only found in combination in clinical strains with the 
toxin B, unlike toxin B or CDT, which were found alone in toxigenic variants. 
New toxigenic variants of C. difficile detected in our laboratory from patients 
with diarrhoea or severe colitis, including a variant producing only toxin A, 
were tested for virulence in the hamster model, which displays the clinical 
features of C. difficile disease. Hamsters infected with a strain producing only 
toxin B induced similar clinical signs, time to death from infection and 
histologic damage compared to the hypervirulent strain 027. No mortality or 
clinical signs of infection but caecal histologic damage was found with the 
variant producing only toxin A. The C. difficile variant strain producing only 
CDT was able to kill one hamster out of seven; nevertheless, the surviving 
animals had few alteration of the caecum.
