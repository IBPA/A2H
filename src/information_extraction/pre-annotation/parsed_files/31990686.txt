Colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection is a growing cause of human 
morbidity and mortality, especially after antibiotic use in health care 
settings. The natural immunity of newborn infants and protective host immune 
mediators against C. difficile infection are not fully understood, with data 
suggesting that inflammation can be either protective or pathogenic. Here, we 
show an essential role for IL-17A produced by γδ T cells in host defense against 
C. difficile infection. Fecal extracts from children with C. difficile infection 
showed increased IL-17A and T cell receptor γ chain expression, and IL-17 
production by intestinal γδ T cells was efficiently induced after infection in 
mice. C. difficile-induced tissue inflammation and mortality were markedly 
increased in mice deficient in IL-17A or γδ T cells. Neonatal mice, with 
naturally expanded RORγt+ γδ T cells poised for IL-17 production were resistant 
to C. difficile infection, whereas elimination of γδ T cells or IL-17A each 
efficiently overturned neonatal resistance against infection. These results 
reveal an expanded role for IL-17-producing γδ T cells in neonatal host defense 
against infection and provide a mechanistic explanation for the clinically 
observed resistance of infants to C. difficile colitis.
