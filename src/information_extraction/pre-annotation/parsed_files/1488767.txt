Human antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis are partly 
due to toxin production by Clostridium difficile. It is now well documented that 
Saccharomyces boulardii protects against C. difficile induced diseases. In an 
attempt to understand better the mechanism of this protective effect, the action 
of S. boulardii on a crude toxin preparation was studied in vitro and in vivo. 
The results showed that the yeast had no effect on the toxins in vitro but was 
able to protect mice inoculated with these toxins. Furthermore, the observation 
by scanning electron microscopy that the mucosa of S. boulardii protected mice 
was not damaged suggest that the yeast mainly acts on the intestinal mucosa.
