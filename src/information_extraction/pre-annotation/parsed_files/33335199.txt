Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major healthcare-associated 
diarrheal disease. Consistent with trends across the United States, C. difficile 
RT106 was the second-most prevalent molecular type in our surveillance in 
Arizona from 2015 to 2018. A representative RT106 strain displayed robust 
virulence and 100% lethality in the hamster model of acute CDI. We identified a 
unique 46Â KB genomic island (GI1) in all RT106 strains sequenced to date, 
including those in public databases. GI1 was not found in its entirety in any 
other C. difficile clade, or indeed, in any other microbial genome; however, 
smaller segments were detected in Enterococcus faecium strains. Molecular clock 
analyses suggested that GI1 was horizontally acquired and sequentially assembled 
over time. GI1 encodes homologs of VanZ and a SrtB-anchored collagen-binding 
adhesin, and correspondingly, all tested RT106 strains had increased teicoplanin 
resistance, and a majority displayed collagen-dependent biofilm formation. Two 
additional genomic islands (GI2 and GI3) were also present in a subset of RT106 
strains. All three islands are predicted to encode mobile genetic elements as 
well as virulence factors. Emergent phenotypes associated with these genetic 
islands may have contributed to the relatively rapid expansion of RT106 in US 
healthcare and community settings.
