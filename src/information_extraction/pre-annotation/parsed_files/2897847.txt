We have purified from Clostridium spiroforme strain 246 an heterogeneous 
population of proteins (Sa) ranging from 43 to 47 kilodaltons exhibiting 
ADP-ribosyl transferase activity as do C. botulinum C2 toxin component I or the 
ia chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin. C. spiriforme Sa had alone no activity 
upon injection in mice or inoculated to Vero cells. When spiroforme ADP ribosyl 
transferase were mixed with a trypsin activated protein (Sb) separated from C. 
spiroforme bacterial supernatant, a lethal effect in mice and cytotoxicity on 
Vero cells were recorded. The Sa cross-reacted immunologically with either the 
light chain of C. perfringens E iota toxin or the ADP-ribosyl transferase from 
C. difficile 196 strain. No immunological relatedness was observed between Sa 
and C2 toxin component I. C. spiroforme toxin is thus another binary toxin close 
to iota.
