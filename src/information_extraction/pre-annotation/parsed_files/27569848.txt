A total of 1034 samples were collected from different sources and C. difficile 
was isolated from 18 (9.04%) of 199 human, 9 (4.89%) of 184 cattle, 29 (12.44%) 
of 233 pig, and from 23 (13.94%) of 165 poultry samples. Variations were 
observed on the rate of isolation according to age and clinical conditions 
(diarrhoea). None of the samples from cow, sheep, goat, local chicken, and wild 
animals yielded any C. difficile. Out of those isolates, 8, 2, 19 and 6 isolates 
from human, cattle, pig and poultry, respectively were toxigenic. The toxigenic 
isolates carried both tcdA, and tcdB (A+B+) and most of the human and the pig 
isolates were also positive for binary toxin genes (cdtA and cdtB). The A+B+ 
isolates belonged to three different toxinotypes (0, VI and XXXIII). Human and 
pig A+B+ isolates belonged to three (045, 126 and ACD 019) and four (046, 087, 
126 and ACD 011) different ribotypes, respectively and the ribotypes of two 
cattle isolates were 014 and ACD 010. Six A+B+ avian isolates belonged to six 
different ribotypes (014, 087, SLO 134, SLO 160, ACD 012, ACD 014). The 
non-toxigenic isolates from human, cattle, pig and poultry were grouped into 7, 
4, 4 and 7 different ribotypes, respectively. PFGE analysis could not 
differentiate similar ribotypes/toxinotypes of toxigenic isolates. All the 
toxigenic isolates showed cytopathic effect on Vero and Hela cell monolayers at 
1:100 dilutions of cell-free culture supernatants within 18-20 h of inoculation.
