Toxin synthesis and endospore formation are two of the most critical factors 
that determine the outcome of infection by Clostridioides difficile. The two 
major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, are the principal factors causing damage to the 
host. Spores are the infectious form of C. difficile, permit survival of the 
bacterium during antibiotic treatment and are the predominant cell form that 
leads to recurrent infection. Toxin production and sporulation have their own 
specific mechanisms of regulation, but they share negative regulation by the 
global regulatory protein CodY. Determining the extent of such regulation and 
its detailed mechanism is important for understanding the linkage between two 
apparently independent biological phenomena and raises the possibility of 
creating new ways of limiting infection. The work described here shows that a 
codY null mutant of a hypervirulent (ribotype 027) strain is even more virulent 
than its parent in a mouse model of infection and that the mutant expresses most 
sporulation genes prematurely during exponential growth phase. Moreover, 
examining the expression patterns of mutants producing CodY proteins with 
different levels of residual activity revealed that expression of the toxin 
genes is dependent on total CodY inactivation, whereas most sporulation genes 
are turned on when CodY activity is only partially diminished. These results 
suggest that, in wild-type cells undergoing nutrient limitation, sporulation 
genes can be turned on before the toxin genes.
