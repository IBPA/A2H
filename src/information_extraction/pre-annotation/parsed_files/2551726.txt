Homogenates of rat pancreatic islets that had been heated for 5 min at 70 
degrees C to inactive hexokinases, catalyzed the ATP-dependent phosphorylation 
of D-fructose. This reaction was dependent on the presence of K+ and was 
inhibited by D-tagatose although not by D-glucose or D-glucose 6-phosphate. The 
phosphorylation product was identified as fructose 1-phosphate through its 
conversion to a bisphosphate ester by Clostridium difficile fructose 1-phosphate 
kinase. These findings allowed the conclusion that fructokinase (ketohexokinase) 
was responsible for this process. Similar results were observed with tumoral 
insulin-producing cells (RINm5F line). Fructokinase may account for a large 
share of fructose phosphorylation in intact islets, particularly in the presence 
of D-glucose.
