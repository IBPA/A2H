BACKGROUND: Disturbances in the intestinal microbial community (i.e. dysbiosis) 
or presence of the microbes with deleterious effects on colonic mucosa has been 
linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. However the role of 
microbiota in induction and progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) has not yet 
been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Three lines of human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice were established 
by gavage of colon biopsy from three patients with active UC. The shift in 
microbial community during its transferring from humans to mice was analyzed by 
next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Spontaneous or 
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and microbiota composition 
profiling in germ-free mice and HMA mice over 3-4 generations were assessed to 
decipher the features of the distinctive and crucial events occurring during 
microbial colonization and animal reproduction.
RESULTS: None of the HMA mice developed colitis spontaneously. When treated with 
DSS, mice in F4 generation of one line of colonized mice (aHMA) developed 
colitis. Compared to the DSS-resistant earlier generations of aHMA mice, the F4 
generation have increased abundance of Clostridium difficile and decrease 
abundance of C. symbiosum in their cecum contents measured by denaturing 
gradient gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing.
CONCLUSION: In our study, mucosa-associated microbes of UC patients were not 
able to induce spontaneous colitis in gnotobiotic BALB/c mice but they were able 
to increase the susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, once the potentially 
deleterious microbes found a suitable niche.
