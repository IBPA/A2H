Various Clostridium difficile strains were studied with respect to their 
pathogenicity in monoassociated mice in relation to levels of toxin A and toxin 
B in vivo and in vitro. Two strains which were the most potent toxin producers 
in vitro induced mortality (100%); mice monoassociated with these strains were 
found to have high levels of both toxins in their ceca and an intense cecal 
epithelial ulceration together with a severe inflammatory process. No mortality 
was observed with the other strains. Strains which were moderately toxinogenic 
in vitro induced inflammation of the cecum but no ulceration, and no toxin A was 
found. Inflammation intensity was not related to toxin B levels. After 3 weeks, 
ceca returned to normal in spite of a chronic cytotoxin production. When 
compared with in vitro results, which showed a good correlation between the 
levels of the two toxins, toxin A amounts in vivo were found to be lowered 
relative to toxin B levels. The lack of detectable toxin A levels in animals 
infected with all but the two most highly toxinogenic strains prevented death. 
This work points out the importance of investigation of toxin A for the 
understanding of C. difficile pathogenicity.
