Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacillus and is the leading cause of 
toxin-mediated nosocomial diarrhea following antibiotic use. C. difficile 
flagella play a role in colonization, adherence, biofilm formation, and toxin 
production, which might contribute to the overall virulence of certain strains. 
Human and animal studies indicate that anti-flagella immune responses may play a 
role in protection against colonization by C. difficile and subsequent disease 
outcome. Here we report that recombinant C. difficile flagellin (FliC) is 
immunogenic and protective in a murine model of C. difficile infection (CDI) 
against a clinical C. difficile strain, UK1. Passive protection experiments 
using anti-FliC polyclonal serum in mice suggest this protection to be 
antibody-mediated. FliC immunization also was able to afford partial protection 
against CDI and death in hamsters following challenge with C. difficile 630Î”erm. 
Additionally, immunization against FliC does not have an adverse effect on the 
normal gut flora of vaccinated hamsters as evidenced by comparing the fecal 
microbiome of vaccinated and control hamsters. Therefore, the use of FliC as a 
vaccine candidate against CDI warrants further testing.
