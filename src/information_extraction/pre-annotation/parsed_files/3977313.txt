Gnotobiotic mice died 2 days after inoculation of a cytotoxigenic Clostridium 
difficile strain. Protection occurred when mice were previously inoculated with 
a strain of Escherichia coli or Bifidobacterium bifidum. Intestinal cytotoxin 
production was highly reduced in the surviving mice, whereas the C. difficile 
population level did not decrease to a great extent.
