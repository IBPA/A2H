Clostridium difficile causes mucosal damage and diarrhea by releasing two 
exotoxins: toxin A and toxin B. C. difficile colitis is associated with 
alterations in bowel flora and the failure to mount an effective antibody 
response. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether antitoxin sera 
prevent toxin-A-induced apoptosis, cytoskeletal disaggregation, cell detachment, 
and tight junction loss in cultured colonic epithelial cells. Serum samples were 
isolated from mice that survived a C. difficile infection following antibiotic 
treatment, and the antitoxin effects of these samples were investigated in 
toxin-A-exposed HT29 colonic epithelial cells and a toxin-A-induced animal model 
of gut inflammation. Unchallenged mice did not produce IgG against toxin A, 
whereas serum (antiserum) from C. difficile-challenged mice showed significant 
IgG responses against toxin A. Treatment with the antiserum markedly inhibited 
mucosal damage and inflammation in the toxin-A-treated mouse model. In contrast 
to control mouse serum, the antiserum also markedly inhibited toxin-A-induced 
DNA fragmentation, dephosphorylation of paxillin and Epo receptor (EpoR), 
deacetylation of tubulin, and upregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p53. Taken 
together, these results reveal that the generated antitoxin serum has 
biotherapeutic effects in preventing various C. difficile toxin-A-induced 
cellular toxicities.
