The intracellularly active bacterial toxin TcdB is a major Clostridioides 
difficile virulence factor that contributes to inflammation and tissue damage 
during disease. Immunization with an inactive TcdB fragment prevents C. 
difficile infection (CDI)-associated pathology. The protective immune response 
against inactive TcdB involves development of antigen-specific memory B cells 
and long-lived plasma cells that encode TcdB-neutralizing antibodies. Unlike the 
response to inactive TcdB, very little is known about the host humoral immune 
response to C. difficile and TcdB during primary and recurrent infection. Here, 
we used a murine model of C. difficile disease recurrence to demonstrate that an 
initial infection induced a serum IgM and mucosal IgA response against the 
toxin, but a low serum IgG response, which is associated with a lack of 
protection against disease during reinfection. Infection induced a partial 
expansion of the T follicular helper cell compartment, essential for B cell 
memory responses, and, consistent with that, failed to significantly expand the 
memory B cell compartment. Further, infection failed to stimulate the memory B 
cell compartment in preimmunized mice, although they were protected against 
associated disease. These results delineate the key humoral immune events that 
follow primary and recurrent C. difficile infection and provide a compelling 
inverse correlation between B cell memory and disease recurrence.
