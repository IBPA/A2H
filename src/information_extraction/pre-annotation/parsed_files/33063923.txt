BACKGROUND: Omeprazole administration is associated with changes in gastric and 
fecal microbiota and increased incidence of Clostridioides difficile 
enterocolitis in humans and dogs.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Study purpose was to assess the effect of omeprazole on 
gastric glandular and fecal microbiota in healthy adult horses.
ANIMALS: Eight healthy horses stabled on straw and fed 100% haylage.
METHODS: Prospective controlled study. Transendoscopic gastric glandular 
biopsies, gastric fluid, and fecal samples were obtained from each horse twice 
at a 7-day interval before the administration of omeprazole. Samples were taken 
on the same horses before and after a 7-day administration of omeprazole (4 
mg/kg PO q24h). pH was assessed on fresh gastric fluid and other samples were 
kept at -20°C until analysis. Bacterial taxonomy profiling was obtained by V1V3 
16S amplicon sequencing from feces and gastric glandular biopsies. Analysis of 
alpha, beta diversity, and comparison between time points were performed with 
MOTHUR and results were considered significant when P < .05.
RESULTS: Gastric pH increased significantly after 7 days of omeprazole 
administration (P = .006). Omeprazole did not induce significant major changes 
in composition of fecal or gastric glandular microbiota, however, after 
administration, certain microbial genera became more predominant in the gastric 
glandular mucosa (lower Simpson's evenness, P = .05). Only the genus Clostridium 
sensu strictu_1 had a significant shift in the glandular gastric mucosa after 
omeprazole administration (P = .002). No population shifts were observed in 
feces.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Oral administration of omeprazole could 
have fewer effects in gastrointestinal microbiota in the horse compared to other 
species.
