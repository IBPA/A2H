BACKGROUND & AIMS: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) released at local sites 
of inflammation promotes inflammation in the periphery. We investigated its 
effects in the intestinal responses caused by toxin A from Clostridium 
difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-associated colitis.
METHODS: Ileal loops were injected with 10 microg of toxin A, and enterotoxic 
responses were measured at various time points.
RESULTS: Pretreatment of mice with 2.5 microg/kg of the CRH receptor antagonist 
alpha-helical CRH((9-41)) that blocks both CRH receptor subtypes reduced toxin 
A-mediated ileal secretion, epithelial cell damage, mucosal edema, neutrophil 
infiltration, and mucosal content of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha. Pretreatment with the specific CRH(1) receptor antagonist 
antalarmin (20 mg/kg, IP) also inhibited toxin A-induced fluid secretion and 
toxin A-associated histologic changes. CRH messenger RNA and protein were 
increased in mouse ileum 30 minutes after intraluminal toxin A administration. 
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that toxin A at 1 
hour caused a substantial increase in the expression of both CRH receptor 
subtypes in the ileal mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral CRH may play a proinflammatory role in toxin A-induced 
intestinal secretion and inflammation and that CRH(1) receptor, at least in 
part, is important in the mediation of these responses.
