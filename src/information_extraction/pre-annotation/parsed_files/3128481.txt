Hemorrhagic toxin (toxin HT) was purified from Clostridium sordellii culture 
filtrate. The purification steps included ultrafiltration through an XM-100 
membrane filter and immunoaffinity chromatography, using a monoclonal antibody 
to toxin A of Clostridium difficile as the ligand. Toxin HT migrated as a major 
band with a molecular weight of 525,000 and a minor band at 450,000 on 
nondenaturing gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight 
was estimated at 300,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing indicated an apparent pI of 6.1. Toxin HT 
was cytotoxic for cultured cells and lethal for mice by intraperitoneal 
injection, and it elicited an accumulation of hemorrhagic fluid in rabbit ileal 
loops. Immunodiffusion analysis revealed a reaction of partial identity between 
toxins A and HT. Immunological cross-reactivity between these toxins was further 
demonstrated by immunoblotting and by neutralization of toxin HT biological 
activity with antibodies to toxin A. A sensitive indirect enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay was used to examine the affinity involved in homologous and 
heterologous antigen-antibody interactions. Our findings show that toxin HT has 
biological activities and immunological properties similar to those of toxin A; 
however, the toxins are not identical.
