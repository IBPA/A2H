Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes serious and sometimes fatal 
symptoms like diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Although antibiotics for 
CDI exist, they are either expensive or cause recurrence of the infection due to 
their altering the colonic microbiota, which is necessary to suppress the 
infection. Here, we leverage a class of known membrane-targeting compounds that 
we previously showed to have broad inhibitory activity across multiple 
Clostridioides difficile strains while preserving the microbiome to develop an 
efficacious agent. A new series of salicylanilides was synthesized, and the most 
potent analog was selected through an in vitro inhibitory assay to evaluate its 
pharmacokinetic parameters and potency in a CDI mouse model. The results 
revealed reduced recurrence of CDI and diminished disturbance of the microbiota 
in mice compared to standard-of-care vancomycin, thus paving the way for novel 
therapy that can potentially target the cell membrane of C. difficile to 
minimize relapse in the recovering patient.
