Clostridium difficile TcdB is a key virulence factor that causes C. 
difficile-associated diseases. Our previous studies have shown that recombinant 
full-length TcdB (rTcdB) induces cell death in CT26 cells, and rTcdB-treated 
CT26 cells with high immunogenicity could stimulate dendritic cell (DC) 
activation and T cell activation in vitro. The rTcdB-treated CT26 cells also 
induce antitumor immunity in mice and protect mice from CT26 cells. 
High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a non-histone nuclear protein, 
which has various biological functions within the nucleus and also acts as an 
extracellular signal molecule involving in inflammatory diseases, cancers or 
autoimmune diseases. In this study, HMGB1 was found to be released from the 
rTcdB-treated CT26 cells. HMGB1 knockdown by using specific siRNA weakened the 
capacity of the BMDCs loaded with the rTcdB-treated CT26 cells to prime T cells 
in vitro and in vivo. The released HMGB1 from CT26 cells could interact with the 
receptor TLR4, which is closely related to DC activation and immune responses. 
The knockdown of HMGB1 also affected the phagocytosis of the rTcdB-treated CT26 
cells by DCs in vitro. Furthermore, HMGB1 weakened the antitumor immunity of the 
rTcdB-treated CT26 cells, which protects mice from rechallenge of the live CT26 
cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HMGB1 plays an important role 
on the immunogenicity of the rTcdB-treated dying CT26 cells.
