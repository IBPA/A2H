Clostridioides difficile infection of the colon leads to severe inflammation and 
damage to the gastrointestinal epithelium due to the production of potent 
toxins. This inflammatory tissue damage causes the liberation of high 
concentrations of host heme at infection sites. Here, we identify the 
C. difficile heme-sensing membrane protein system (HsmRA) and show that this 
operon induces a protective response that repurposes heme to counteract 
antimicrobial oxidative stress responses. HsmR senses vertebrate heme, leading 
to increased expression of the hsmRA operon and subsequent deployment of HsmA to 
capture heme and reduce redox damage caused by inflammatory mediators of 
protection and antibiotic therapy. Strains with inactivated hsmR or hsmA have 
increased sensitivity to redox-active compounds and reduced colonization 
persistence in a murine model of relapse C. difficile infection. These results 
define a mechanism exploited by C. difficile to repurpose toxic heme within the 
inflamed gut as a shield against antimicrobial compounds.
