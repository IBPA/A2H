BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a serious threat for an 
aging population. Using an aged mouse model, we evaluated the effect of age and 
the roles of innate immunity and intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: Aged (18 months) and young (8 weeks) mice were infected with C 
difficile, and disease severity, immune response, and intestinal microbiome were 
compared. The same experiment was repeated with intestinal microbiota exchange 
between aged and young mice before infection.
RESULTS: Higher mortality was observed in aged mice with weaker neutrophilic 
mobilization in blood and intestinal tissue and depressed proinflammatory 
cytokines in early infection. Microbiota exchange improved survival and early 
immune response in aged mice. Microbiome analysis revealed that aged mice have 
significant deficiencies in Bacteroidetes phylum and, specifically, Bacteroides, 
Alistipes, and rc4-4 genera, which were replenished by cage switching.
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota-dependent alteration in innate immune response early on 
during infection may explain poor outcome in aged host with CDI.
