OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a dog's superior olfactory sensitivity can be 
used to detect Clostridium difficile in stool samples and hospital patients.
DESIGN: Proof of principle study, using a case-control design.
SETTING: Two large Dutch teaching hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: A 2 year old beagle trained to identify the smell of C difficile 
and tested on 300 patients (30 with C difficile infection and 270 controls).
INTERVENTION: The dog was guided along the wards by its trainer, who was blinded 
to the participants' infection status. Each detection round concerned 10 
patients (one case and nine controls). The dog was trained to sit or lie down 
when C difficile was detected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity for detection of C difficile 
in stool samples and in patients.
RESULTS: The dog's sensitivity and specificity for identifying C difficile in 
stool samples were both 100% (95% confidence interval 91% to 100%). During the 
detection rounds, the dog correctly identified 25 of the 30 cases (sensitivity 
83%, 65% to 94%) and 265 of the 270 controls (specificity 98%, 95% to 99%).
CONCLUSION: A trained dog was able to detect C difficile with high estimated 
sensitivity and specificity, both in stool samples and in hospital patients 
infected with C difficile.
