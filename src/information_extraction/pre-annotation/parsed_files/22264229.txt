BACKGROUND: Severe Clostridium difficile toxin-induced enteritis is 
characterized by exuberant intestinal tissue inflammation, epithelial disruption 
and diarrhea. Adenosine, through its action on the adenosine A2A receptor, 
prevents neutrophillic adhesion and oxidative burst and inhibits inflammatory 
cytokine production. Alanyl-glutamine enhances intestinal mucosal repair and 
decreases apoptosis of enterocytes. This study investigates the protection from 
enteritis by combination therapy with ATL 370, an adenosine A2A receptor 
agonist, and alanyl-glutamine in a rabbit and murine intestinal loop models of 
C. difficile toxin A-induced epithelial injury.
METHODS: Toxin A with or without alanyl-glutamine was administered 
intraluminally to rabbit ileal or murine cecal loops. Animals were also given 
either PBS or ATL 370 parenterally. Ileal tissues were examined for secretion, 
histopathology, apoptosis, Cxcl1/KC and IL-10.
RESULTS: ATL 370 decreased ileal secretion and histopathologic changes in loops 
treated with Toxin A. These effects were reversed by the A2A receptor 
antagonist, SCH 58261, in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of ATL 370 
and alanyl-glutamine significantly further decreased ileal secretion, mucosal 
injury and apoptosis more than loops treated with either drug alone. ATL 370 and 
alanyl-glutamine also decreased intestinal tissue KC and IL-10.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with an adenosine A2A receptor agonist and 
alanyl-glutamine is effective in reversing C. difficile toxin A-induced 
epithelial injury, inflammation, secretion and apoptosis in animals and has 
therapeutic potential for the management of C. difficile infection.
