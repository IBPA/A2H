The human pathogenic bacterium Clostridioides difficile produces two exotoxins 
TcdA and TcdB, which inactivate Rho GTPases thereby causing C. 
difficile-associated diseases (CDAD) including life-threatening pseudomembranous 
colitis. Hypervirulent strains produce additionally the binary actin 
ADP-ribosylating toxin CDT. These strains are hallmarked by more severe forms of 
CDAD and increased frequency and severity. Once in the cytosol, the toxins act 
as enzymes resulting in the typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, targeting and 
inactivation of the released toxins are of peculiar interest. Prompted by 
earlier findings that human α-defensin-1 neutralizes TcdB, we investigated the 
effects of the defensin on all three C. difficile toxins. Inhibition of TcdA, 
TcdB, and CDT was demonstrated by analyzing toxin-induced changes in cell 
morphology, substrate modification, and decrease in transepithelial electrical 
resistance. Application of α-defensin-1 protected cells and human intestinal 
organoids from the cytotoxic effects of TcdA, TcdB, CDT, and their combination 
which is attributed to a direct interaction between the toxins and α-defensin-1. 
In mice, the application of α-defensin-1 reduced the TcdA-induced damage of 
intestinal loops in vivo. In conclusion, human α-defensin-1 is a specific and 
potent inhibitor of the C. difficile toxins and a promising agent to develop 
novel therapeutic options against C. difficile infections.
