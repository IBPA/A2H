BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile toxin A is the principal mediator of 
inflammatory enterocolitis in experimental animals. The purpose of this study 
was to explore the effect of ketotifen, an anti-inflammatory drug, on toxin 
A-induced enterotoxicity in rat ileum.
METHODS: The effects of intragastric administration of ketotifen on secretion, 
mannitol permeability, histological damage, and mucosal levels of leukotriene 
B4, leukotriene C4, and platelet activating factor in toxin A-exposed rat ileal 
loops were measured in vivo. The effects of ketotifen on toxin A-mediated 
release of rat mast cell protease II (rat mucosa mast cell product) release were 
also measured in rat ileal explants in vitro. The effect of ketotifen on 
neutrophil migration in vitro was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Ketotifen pretreatment inhibited toxin A-associated intestinal 
secretion by 42.5% and mannitol permeability by 56.3% and reduced epithelial 
cell inflammation and necrosis. These effects were associated with reduced 
levels of leukotriene B4 by 65.8%, leukotriene C4 by 88.8%, platelet activating 
factor by 77.8%, and inhibition of rat mast cell protease II by 58.4%. In 
addition, pretreatment of neutrophils with ketotifen inhibited neutrophil 
migration in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of ketotifen in this animal model was 
associated with significant inhibition of release of mast cells and neutrophil 
derived mediators, supporting their involvement in C. difficile enteritis.
