Features of Clostridioides difficile transmission in swine and the role of 
rodents as C. difficile reservoir are not clear. To investigate if rodents can 
carry strains of C. difficile that are genetically similar to those isolated 
from swine, 97 fecal samples from neonatal piglets and 41 intestinal contents 
from rodents were collected in two farms. All samples were subjected to 
C. difficile culture and the presence of A/B toxins in piglet feces were 
accessed by commercial enzyme imunoassay (EIA). C. difficile isolates were typed 
by double- (DLST) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). C. difficile was 
isolated from 15.5% of piglets and 31.7% of rodents. Most isolates were 
identified as DLST type 4-4 and 17-5 (both are ST11), which were found in both 
rodents and piglets. Results of this study suggested that rodents may have a 
role on the transmission and spread of C. difficile strains to swine.
