Examination of the biological activities of the two known toxins of Clostridium 
difficile revealed that one of the toxins (toxin A) elicited a hemorrhagic fluid 
response in rabbit intestinal loops and a positive fluid response in infant 
mice. The other toxin (toxin B) did not produce a significant fluid response in 
either model, although the toxin was more lethal in infant mice. Both toxins 
elicited erythematous and hemorrhagic skin reactions and increased vascular 
permeability in rabbit skin.
