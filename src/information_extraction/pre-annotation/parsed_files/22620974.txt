Clostridium difficile is emerging worldwide as a major cause of nosocomial 
infections. The negatively charged PSII polysaccharide has been found in 
different strains of C. difficile and, thereby, represents an important target 
molecule for a possible carbohydrate-based vaccine. In order to identify a 
synthetic fragment that after conjugation to a protein carrier could be able to 
induce anti-PSII antibodies, we exploited a combination of chemical synthesis 
with immunochemistry, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and solid state 
NMR. We demonstrate that the phosphate group is crucial in synthetic glycans to 
mimic the native PSII polysaccharide; both native PSII and a phosphorylated 
synthetic hexasaccharide repeating unit conjugated to CRM(197) elicit comparable 
immunogenic responses in mice. This finding can aid design and selection of 
carbohydrate antigens to be explored as vaccine candidates.
