Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is an opportunistic bacteria that 
flourishes in intestinal flora is altered by antibiotic use and can cause large 
intestinal colitis if left untreated. The mechanism of MAVS-mediated innate 
immune signaling in response to C. difficile infection remains unclear. This 
knowledge gap was addressed in the present research by administration of an 
antibiotic cocktail to WT and MAVS-deficient (MAVS-/-) mice for five days, 
followed by the oral administration of C. difficile VPI 10,463 strain (1 × 107 
colony forming units). Subjects were subsequently observed for another eight 
days for signs of colitis. Colon and cecum tissue samples were harvested from 
naive and infected mice two days post-infection for histopathologic analysis. 
Colon tissue samples were harvested to analyze cytokine gene expression and 
RegIIIβ/γ gene expression. MAVS-deficient mice suffered significantly higher 
mortality rates as well as increased mucosal tissue inflammation and damage 
after C. difficile infection (P <0.05). MAVS-/- mice displayed a significantly 
greater increase in IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-β expression in colon tissues in 
contrast to WT mice challenged with C. difficile (P <0.05). RegIIIβ/γ gene 
expression was severely attenuated in the colons of MAVS-/- mice (P <0.05). 
These findings underscore MAVS as a vital innate immune system mediator in the 
intestinal mucosa and further suggests that MAVS-mediated maintenance of the 
intestinal epithelial barrier is an important defense against enteric pathogens.
