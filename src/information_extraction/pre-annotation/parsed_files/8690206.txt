BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal inflammation is associated with increased 
synthesis of nitric oxide, whereas inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) reduces 
experimental chronic intestinal inflammation. The aim of this study was to test 
the effects of NO blockers and donors on acute intestinal inflammation induced 
by Clostridium difficile toxin A in rat ileum.
METHODS: Rats received NOS inhibitors or NO donors before measurement of 
toxin-mediated ileal secretion and permeability changes. Mucosal mast cell and 
neutrophil activity were measured by release of rat mast cell protease II and 
myeloperoxidase activity, respectively.
RESULTS: NOS inhibitors augmented but an NO donor inhibited toxin A-mediated 
ileal secretion and permeability when given before but not after toxin 
administration. Neither an NOS inhibitor nor an NO donor had any effect on 
cholera toxin-mediated secretion. Mast cell degranulation and neutrophil 
infiltration occurred after injection of toxin A or an NOS inhibitor, whereas 
the NO donor blocked both toxin A effects.
CONCLUSIONS: NOS inhibitors augmented and an NO donor blocked the intestinal 
effects of toxin A but not of cholera toxin. NO protects against toxin A by 
inhibition of intestinal mast cells and neutrophils, which are activated by 
toxin A, but not by cholera toxin.
