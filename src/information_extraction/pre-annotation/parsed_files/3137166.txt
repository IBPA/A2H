By screening possible ADP-ribosyltransferase activities in culture supernatants 
from various Clostridium species, we have found one Clostridium difficile strain 
(CD196) (isolated in our laboratory) that is able to produce, in addition to 
toxins A and B, a new ADP-ribosyltransferase that was shown to covalently modify 
cell actin as Clostridium botulinum C2 or Clostridium perfringens E iota toxins 
do. The molecular weight of the CD196 ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT) was 
determined to be 43 kilodaltons, and its isoelectric point was 7.8. No cytotoxic 
activity on Vero cells or lethal activity upon injection in mice was associated 
with this enzyme. CDT was neither related to C. difficile A or B toxins nor to 
C. botulinum C2 toxin component I. However, Vero cells cultivated in the 
presence of C. difficile B toxin had a lower amount of actin able to be 
ADP-ribosylated by CDT or C2 toxin in vitro. Antibodies raised against CDT 
reacted by immunoblot analysis with a 43-kilodalton protein of C. perfringens 
type E culture supernatant producing the iota toxin.
