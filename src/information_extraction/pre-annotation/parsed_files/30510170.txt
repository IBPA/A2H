Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is mediated by two major exotoxins, toxin 
A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), that damage the colonic epithelial barrier and 
induce inflammatory responses. The function of the colonic vascular barrier 
during CDI has been relatively understudied. Here we report increased colonic 
vascular permeability in CDI mice and elevated vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A), which was induced in vivo by infection with TcdA- and/or 
TcdB-producing C. difficile strains but not with a TcdA-TcdB- isogenic mutant. 
TcdA or TcdB also induced the expression of VEGF-A in human colonic mucosal 
biopsies. Hypoxia-inducible factor signalling appeared to mediate toxin-induced 
VEGF production in colonocytes, which can further stimulate human intestinal 
microvascular endothelial cells. Both neutralization of VEGF-A and inhibition of 
its signalling pathway attenuated CDI in vivo. Compared to healthy controls, CDI 
patients had significantly higher serum VEGF-A that subsequently decreased after 
treatment. Our findings indicate critical roles for toxin-induced VEGF-A and 
colonic vascular permeability in CDI pathogenesis and may also point to the 
pathophysiological significance of the gut vascular barrier in response to 
virulence factors of enteric pathogens. As an alternative to pathogen-targeted 
therapy, this study may enable new host-directed therapeutic approaches for 
severe, refractory CDI.
