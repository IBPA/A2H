Clostridium septicum lethal (alpha-toxin) was purified and found to be a basic 
protein (pI 8.4) of approximately 48 kDa that is both lethal and hemolytic. The 
alpha-toxin had a hemolytic activity of approximately 2 x 10(7) hemolytic units 
per mg and a 50% lethal dose of approximately 10 micrograms/kg of body weight 
for mice. The alpha-toxin formed concentration-dependent, sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-resistant aggregates of approximately 230 kDa. Mice immunized with 
alpha-toxin showed a significant increase in survival time over mock-immunized 
mice when challenged with C. septicum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated 
against the purified toxin and was used to confirm that toxin with the same 
molecular weight was present in seven different C. septicum isolates. No 
proteins in the supernatants from cultures of Clostridium perfringens, 
Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium chauvoei, or Clostridium difficile were 
found to react with the C. septicum alpha-toxin-specific antibody.
