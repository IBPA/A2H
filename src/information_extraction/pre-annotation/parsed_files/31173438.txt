Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, toxin-producing 
anaerobe pathogen, and can induce nosocomial antibiotic-associated intestinal 
disease. While production of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) contribute to the 
main pathogenesis of C. difficile, adhesion and colonization of C. difficile in 
the host gut are prerequisites for disease onset. Previous cell wall proteins 
(CWPs) were identified that were implicated in C. difficile adhesion and 
colonization. In this study, we predicted and characterized Cwp22 
(CDR20291_2601) from C. difficile R20291 to be involved in bacterial adhesion 
based on the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool. The ClosTron-generated cwp22 
mutant showed decreased TcdA and TcdB production during early growth, and 
increased cell permeability and autolysis. Importantly, the cwp22 mutation 
impaired cellular adherence in vitro and decreased cytotoxicity and fitness over 
the parent strain in a mouse infection model. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase 
cytotoxicity assay, live-dead cell staining and transmission electron microscopy 
confirmed the decreased cell viability of the cwp22 mutant. Thus, Cwp22 is 
involved in cell wall integrity and cell viability, which could affect most 
phenotypes of R20291. Our data suggest that Cwp22 is an attractive target for C. 
difficile infection therapeutics and prophylactics.
