An attempt was made to isolate Clostridium difficile from a total of 565 mice 
from nine different conventional mouse colonies and six different 
specified-pathogen-free mouse colonies. C. difficile was isolated from all the 
conventional colonies but from none of the specified-pathogen-free colonies. 
Ampicillin injected intraperitoneally increased the isolation rate of C. 
difficile from mouse faeces to 63.6% compared with 19.4% from untreated mice.
