Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is increasing morbidity and mortality 
rates globally. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), an effective therapy for 
eliminating Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), cannot be used extensive 
due to a range of challenges. Probiotics thus constitutes a promising 
alternative therapy. In our study, we evaluated the effect of consortium of 
probiotics including five Lactobacilli strains and two Bifidobacterium strains 
on the colonization of toxigenic BI/NAP1/027 C. difficile in a mouse model. The 
results of 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics showed the consortium 
of probiotics effectively decreased the colonization of C. difficile, changed 
the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota, decreased the primary bile acids, 
and increased the secondary bile acids. Spearman's correlation showed that some 
of the OTUs such as Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Blautia et al. were positively 
correlated with C. difficile numbers and the primary bile acids, and negatively 
correlated with the secondary bile acids. However, some of the OTUs, such as 
Butyricicoccus, Ruminococcus, and Rikenellaceae, were negatively correlated with 
C. difficile copies and the primary bile acids, and positively correlated with 
the secondary bile acids. In summary, the consortium of probiotics effectively 
decreases the colonization of C. difficile, probably via alteration of gut 
microbiota and bile acids. Our probiotics mixture thus offers a promising FMT 
alternative.
