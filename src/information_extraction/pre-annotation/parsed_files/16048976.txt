In mice, subcutaneous administration of antibiotics that disrupt the anaerobic 
microflora (i.e., clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ceftriaxone) 
facilitated in vitro growth of and toxin production by Clostridium difficile in 
cecal contents, whereas antibiotics that cause minimal disruption of the 
anaerobic microflora (i.e., levofloxacin, cefepime, and aztreonam) did not.
