Antibodies targeting the Clostridium difficile toxin A and toxin B confer 
protective immunity to C. difficile associated disease in animal models and 
provided protection against recurrent C. difficile disease in human subjects. 
These antibodies are directed against the receptor binding domains (RBD) located 
in the carboxy-terminal portion of both toxins and inhibit binding of the toxins 
to their receptors. We have constructed a recombinant fusion protein containing 
portions of the RBD from both toxin A and toxin B and expressed it in 
Escherichia coli. The fusion protein induced high levels of serum antibodies to 
both toxins A and B capable of neutralizing toxin activity both in vitro and in 
vivo. In a hamster C. difficile infection model, immunization with the fusion 
protein reduced disease severity and conferred significant protection against a 
lethal dose of C. difficile spores. Our studies demonstrate the potential of the 
fusion protein as a vaccine that could provide protection from C. difficile 
disease in humans.
