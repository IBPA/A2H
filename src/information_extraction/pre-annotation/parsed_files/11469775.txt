Faecal samples from adult horses and from foals with diarrhoea or with normal 
faeces were evaluated for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C. difficile 
toxins, C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and C. perfringens spore counts. 
Clostridium difficile was isolated from 7/55 horses (12.7%) and 11/31 foals 
(35.5%) with colitis, but from 1/255 normal adults (0.4%) and 0/47 normal foals 
(P<0.001). Clostridium difficile toxins A and/or B were detected in 12/55 
diarrhoeic adults (21.8%) and 5/30 diarrhoeic foals (16.7%) but in only 1/83 
adults (1.2%) and 0/21 foals with normal faeces (P<0.001 and P<0.05, 
respectively). Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 9/47 
diarrhoeic adults (19%) and 8/28 diarrhoeic foals (28.6%), but was not detected 
in 47 adult horses (P<0.002) or 4 foals (P = 0.22) with normal faeces. The 
positive predictive value of isolation of C. perfringens with respect to the 
presence of CPE was only 60% in adult horses and 64% in foals. There was no 
association between total C. perfringens spore count and CPE in the faeces. The 
overall mortality rate from colitis was 22% for adult horses and 18% for foals. 
Clostridium difficile toxin-positive adult horses with colitis were less likely 
to survive than C. difficile-negative horses with colitis (P = 0.03). This study 
provides further evidence that C. difficile and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens 
are associated with equine enterocolitis.
