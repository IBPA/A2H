Clostridium difficile persists in hospitals by exploiting an infection cycle 
that is dependent on humans shedding highly resistant and infectious spores. 
Here we show that human virulent C. difficile can asymptomatically colonize the 
intestines of immunocompetent mice, establishing a carrier state that persists 
for many months. C. difficile carrier mice consistently shed low levels of 
spores but, surprisingly, do not transmit infection to cohabiting mice. However, 
antibiotic treatment of carriers triggers a highly contagious supershedder 
state, characterized by a dramatic reduction in the intestinal microbiota 
species diversity, C. difficile overgrowth, and excretion of high levels of 
spores. Stopping antibiotic treatment normally leads to recovery of the 
intestinal microbiota species diversity and suppresses C. difficile levels, 
although some mice persist in the supershedding state for extended periods. 
Spore-mediated transmission to immunocompetent mice treated with antibiotics 
results in self-limiting mucosal inflammation of the large intestine. In 
contrast, transmission to mice whose innate immune responses are compromised 
(Myd88(-/-)) leads to a severe intestinal disease that is often fatal. Thus, 
mice can be used to investigate distinct stages of the C. difficile infection 
cycle and can serve as a valuable surrogate for studying the spore-mediated 
transmission and interactions between C. difficile and the host and its 
microbiota, and the results obtained should guide infection control measures.
