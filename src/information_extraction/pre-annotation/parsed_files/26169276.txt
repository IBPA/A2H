Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is of particular concern among 
health care-associated infections. The role of the microbiota in disease 
recovery is apparent given the success of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
for recurrent CDI. Here, we present a murine model of CDI relapse to further 
define the microbiota recovery following FMT. Cefoperazone-treated mice were 
infected with C. difficile 630 spores and treated with vancomycin after 
development of clinical disease. Vancomycin treatment suppressed both C. 
difficile colonization and cytotoxin titers. However, C. difficile counts 
increased within 7 days of completing treatment, accompanied by relapse of 
clinical signs. The administration of FMT immediately after vancomycin cleared 
C. difficile and decreased cytotoxicity within 1 week. The effects of FMT on the 
gut microbiota community were detectable in recipients 1-day posttransplant. 
Conversely, mice not treated with FMT remained persistently colonized with high 
levels of C. difficile, and the gut microbiota in these mice persisted at low 
diversity. These results suggest that full recovery of colonization resistance 
against C. difficile requires the restoration of a specific community structure.
