We evaluated the operating characteristics of 2 comparably trained dogs as a 
"point-of-care" diagnostic tool to detect toxin gene-positive Clostridium 
difficile. Although each dog could detect toxin gene-positive C difficile in 
stool specimens with sensitivities of 77.6 and 92.6 and specificities of 85.1 
and 84.5, respectively, interrater reliability is only modest (Cohen's kappa 
0.52), limiting widespread application.
