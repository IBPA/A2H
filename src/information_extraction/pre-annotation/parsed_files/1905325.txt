The purpose of this study was to characterize the surface receptor for toxin A, 
the enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, on rabbit intestinal brush borders 
(BB) and on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Purified toxin A was 
radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 
microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound 
specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with 
dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL 
cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific 
binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to 
toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin 
or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation 
of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, 
and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The 
addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with 
rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or 
Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Our data indicate 
that the membrane receptor for toxin A is a galactose and 
N-acetyl-glucosamine-containing glycoprotein which appears to be coupled to a G 
protein.
