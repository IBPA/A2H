Clostridium difficile is the principal cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. 
Major metabolic requirements for colonization and expansion of C. difficile 
after microbiota disturbance have not been fully determined. In this study, we 
show that glutamate utilization is important for C. difficile to establish 
itself in the animal gut. When the gluD gene, which codes for glutamate 
dehydrogenase (GDH), was disrupted, the mutant C. difficile was unable to 
colonize and cause disease in a hamster model. Further, from the complementation 
experiment it appears that extracellular GDH may be playing a role in promoting 
C. difficile colonization and disease progression. Quantification of free amino 
acids in the hamster gut during C. difficile infection showed that glutamate is 
among preferred amino acids utilized by C. difficile during its expansion. This 
study provides evidence of the importance of glutamate metabolism for C. 
difficile pathogenesis.
