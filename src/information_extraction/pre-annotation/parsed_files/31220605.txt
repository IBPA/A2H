Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common nosocomial 
infections worldwide and an urgent public health threat. Epidemiological and 
experimental studies have demonstrated an association between nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure and enhanced susceptibility to, and 
severity of, CDI. NSAIDs target cyclooxygenase enzymes and inhibit the 
production of prostaglandins (PGs), but the therapeutic potential of exogenous 
introduction of PGs for the treatment of CDI has not been explored. In this 
study, we report that treatment with the FDA-approved stable PGE1 analogue, 
misoprostol, protects mice against C. difficile-associated mortality, intestinal 
pathology, and CDI-mediated intestinal permeability. Furthermore, we report that 
the effect of misoprostol on the gastrointestinal tract contributes to increased 
recovery of the gut microbiota following antibiotic perturbation. Together, 
these data implicate PGs as an important host-factor associated with recovery to 
C. difficile-associated disease and demonstrate the potential for misoprostol in 
the treatment of CDI. Further studies to explore the safety and efficacy of 
misoprostol treatment of CDI in humans is needed.
