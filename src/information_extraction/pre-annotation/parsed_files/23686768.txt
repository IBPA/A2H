Clostridium difficile is commonly associated with diarrhea and colitis in humans 
and other mammals, including horses. To this date, the epidemiologic, 
microbiologic, clinical, and diagnostic aspects of C. difficile-associated 
disease (CDAD) in horses have been thoroughly described. However, reports 
describing the enteric pathology of this disease in horses are limited. This 
study presents a comprehensive description of the pathologic characteristics of 
CDAD in 21 horses and discusses the criteria for the diagnosis of the disease. 
Case selection was based on C. difficile A/B toxins detection (enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay) in intestinal content samples accompanied by compatible 
gross and microscopic enteric lesions. Grossly, multifocal, segmental, or 
diffuse hemorrhage; congestion; and/or marked gelatinous edema of the intestinal 
wall with abundant bloody or green watery contents were observed. 
Histologically, the most common lesion was severe necrotizing or 
necrohemorrhagic enteritis, colitis, or typhlocolitis, with mucosal and/or 
submucosal thrombosis and marked submucosal edema. The pathology of CDAD in 
horses is similar to that caused by other equine enteric pathogens; therefore, a 
definitive diagnosis requires detection of C. difficile A/B toxins in the 
intestinal contents.
