Lactobacillus equigenerosi strain Le1, a natural inhabitant of the equine 
gastrointestinal tract, survived pH 3.0 and incubation in the presence of 1.5% 
(wt/vol) bile salts for at least 2 h. Strain Le1 showed 8% cell surface 
hydrophobicity, 60% auto-aggregation, and 47% coaggregation with Clostridium 
difficile C6. Only 1% of the cells adhered to viable buccal epithelial cells and 
invaded the cells within 20 min after contact. Preincubation of strain Le1 in a 
buffer containing pronase prevented adhesion to viable epithelial cells. 
Preincubation in a pepsin buffer delayed invasion from 20 min to 1 h. Strain Le1 
did not adhere to nonviable epithelial cells. Administration of L. equigenerosi 
Le1 (1 Ã— 10(9) CFU per 50 kg body weight) to healthy horses did not increase 
white blood cell numbers. Differential white blood cell counts and aspartate 
aminotransferase levels remained constant. Glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and 
urea levels remained constant during administration with L. equigenerosi Le1 but 
decreased during the week after administration.
