Pseudomembranous colitis is most often caused by toxins secreted by Clostridium 
difficile following bowel flora overgrowth after antibiotic use. The secretory 
and inflammatory effects observed in C. difficile toxin A-induced enterocolitis 
in the rat ileum are inhibited by CP-96,345, a substance P (SP) receptor 
antagonist. To determine if SP plays a role in the pathogenesis of human 
pseudomembranous colitis, SP receptor distribution was examined in a toxin 
A-positive specimen of bowel. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to 
examine SP receptors in tissue from a patient who tested positive for C. 
Difficile toxin. SP receptors were massively increased in small blood vessels 
and lymphoid aggregates in the pseudomembranous colitis bowel in comparison to 
control specimens. The SP binding was saturable and exhibited similar affinities 
for SP and CP-96,345. SP may contribute to the inflammatory response in 
pseudomembranous colitis via a massive increase in SP receptor antagonists may 
offer a novel therapeutic intervention for pseudomembranous colitis.
