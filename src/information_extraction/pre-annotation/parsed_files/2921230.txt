Phenelfamycins A, B, C, E, F and unphenelfamycin make up a recently isolated 
group of elfamycin-type antibiotics. All of the phenelfamycins were active 
against Gram-positive anaerobes, including Clostridium difficile. Phenelfamycin 
A was also active in vitro against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Streptococci. 
Phenelfamycin A was found to be effective in prolonging the survival of hamsters 
in an animal model of C. difficile enterocolitis. After oral administration of 
phenelfamycin A to hamsters, antibiotic was detected in the caecal contents but 
not in the blood.
