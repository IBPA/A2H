Clostridium difficile inoculated BALB/c mice were investigated to assess the 
comparative role of antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor. They were examined for 
colonization and toxin production by C. difficile as well as myeloperoxidase 
activity and histopathological changes in the intestinal tract. The C. difficile 
count, toxin A and B titres and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly 
higher (P>0.05) in ampicillin and lansoprazole receiving groups as compared to 
the control and the C. difficile receiving groups. Similarly they showed 
significant difference (P >0.05) for epithelial damage, oedema and neutrophilic 
infiltrate in colons. In addition to antibiotic, PPI also acts as an independent 
risk factor for C. difficile infection in experimental studies.
