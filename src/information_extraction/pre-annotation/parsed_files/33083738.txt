Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated 
colitis. Here, we report that lemon exosome-like nanoparticles (LELNs) 
manipulated probiotics to inhibit C. diff infection (CDI). LELN-manipulated 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Streptococcus thermophilus ST-21 (STH) 
(LELN-LS) decrease CDI mortality via an LELN-mediated increase in bile 
resistance and gut survivability. LELN-LS treatment increases the AhR ligands 
indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3Ald), leading to 
induction of IL-22, and increases lactic acid leading to a decrease of C. diff 
fecal shedding by inhibiting C. diff growth and indole biosynthesis. A 
synergistic effect between STH and LGG was identified. The STH metabolites 
inhibit gluconeogenesis of LGG and allow fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to 
accumulate in LGG; accumulated FBP then activates lactate dehydrogenase of LGG 
(LGG-LDH) and enhances production of lactic acid and the AhR ligand. Our 
findings provide a new strategy for CDI prevention and treatment with a new type 
of prebiotics.
