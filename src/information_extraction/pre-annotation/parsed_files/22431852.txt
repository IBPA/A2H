Oritavancin is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic with concentration-dependent 
killing of Gram-positive cocci and pharmacokinetics characterized by extensive 
tissue distribution and a long terminal half-life. Its development was hindered 
by a 16- to 32-fold underestimation of activity against staphylococci and 
enterococci because of oritavancin's sticking to vials and tubes. 
Dose-fractionation studies in animal models suggested the peak concentration was 
the major index for efficacy. Once-daily intravenous administration of 
oritavancin was effective in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
endocarditis, penicillin-susceptible and cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal 
meningitis in rabbits, staphylococcal and enterococcal central venous catheter 
infections in rats, and 24-hour postprophylaxis of inhaled anthrax in mice. 
Orally administered oritavancin was more effective than vancomycin in 
Clostridium difficile infection in hamsters. Pharmacodynamics suggested that a 
single dose of oritavancin at 1200 mg would be efficacious in humans. Simulation 
of this dose in neutropenic mice was highly effective in methicillin-sensitive 
S. aureus and MRSA thigh and bacteremia infections and pneumococcal lung 
infections.
