One of the main challenges associated with Clostridioides difficile infection 
(CDI) in humans and domestic animals is the lack of an effective preventive 
strategy. One strategy with promising results is the oral administration of 
non-toxigenic strains of C. difficile (NTCD). Recently, Z31, a NTCD strain 
isolated from a healthy dog, showed promising results to prevent CDI in 
hamsters. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the capacity of Z31 to 
prevent CDI in piglets using an experimental model. Twenty neonatal piglets were 
randomly distributed in three groups: G1 - 106 spores of Z31 followed by 107 
spores of a toxigenic C. difficile strain (n = 7), G2 (positive control) - 107 
spores of a toxigenic C. difficile strain (n = 7), and G3 (negative control) - 
no biological inoculum (n = 6). All animals were kept in individual insulators 
and observed for 60 h. Data regarding clinical signs, macro and microscopic 
lesions, toxigenic culture of C. difficile, and detection of A/B toxins in the 
feces were evaluated. All evaluated parameters were significantly lower in 
animals that received Z31 compared to the positive control. Thus, oral 
administration of Z31 was able to prevent CDI in piglets in an experimental 
model.
