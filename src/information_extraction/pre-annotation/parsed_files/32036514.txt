BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common 
hospital-acquired infections and is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality. Since owning a cat or dog could enrich the gut microbiome, we 
hypothesized that it would be protective against CDI.
AIMS: We conducted a survey study on patients tested for CDI in order to assess 
whether living in the presence of a pet is associated with a decreased risk of 
CDI.
METHODS: We surveyed subjects aged 18-90 over a 14-month period using a 
retrospective case-control design. Subjects with CDI were matched by gender and 
age to patients who tested negative and had no prior history of CDI. A web-based 
survey was provided to subjects by mail or assisted by phone. Conditional 
logistic regression was used to assess for associations between CDI and the 
various risk factors.
RESULTS: 205 CDI positive and 205 CDI negative subjects (response rate of 50.2%) 
were included. After matching for age and sex, living with a cat or dog was not 
associated with negative CDI testing. Exploratory multivariable modeling 
identified an unexpected association between positive CDI testing and high meat 
intake (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.21-3.77) as well as between positive CDI testing and 
cat allergies (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.02-3.46).
CONCLUSION: Living with a cat or dog was not associated with negative CDI 
testing. Several novel risk factors for CDI have been identified including high 
meat intake and cat allergies.
