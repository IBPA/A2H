Human Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is of unquestioned 
importance in humans, and has been a not-uncommon cause of enteric disease in 
horses, dogs, and ratites. Over the past 5 years, C. difficile has emerged as a 
major cause of neonatal enteritis in pigs. Piglets 1-7 days of age are affected, 
with gross lesions frequently including mesocolonic edema. Colonic contents may 
be pasty-to-watery and yellow, although some piglets are constipated or 
obstipated. Focal suppuration and segmental necrosis are seen on microscopic 
examination of cecal and colonic lamina propria, and exudation of neutrophils 
and fibrin into the lumen gives rise to the so-called volcano lesions. Results 
of one study revealed that more than one-third of piglets with enteritis were 
affected by C. difficile alone, while an additional quarter of affected piglets 
may have had mixed infections. C. difficile may be the most important 
uncontrolled cause of neonatal diarrhea in pigs.
