Clostridium difficile is a major cause of chronic antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
and a significant health care-associated pathogen that forms highly resistant 
and infectious spores. Spo0A is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator 
that plays a key role in initiating sporulation in Bacillus and Clostridium 
species. Here, we use a murine model to study the role of the C. difficile spo0A 
gene during infection and transmission. We demonstrate that C. difficile spo0A 
mutant derivatives can cause intestinal disease but are unable to persist within 
and effectively transmit between mice. Thus, the C. difficile Spo0A protein 
plays a key role in persistent infection, including recurrence and host-to-host 
transmission in mice.
