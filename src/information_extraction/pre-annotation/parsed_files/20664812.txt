Recently, we constructed and characterized isogenic tcdA and tcdB mutants of a 
virulent Clostridium difficile strain and used a hamster model of disease to 
demonstrate that toxin B, not toxin A, is essential for virulence of this 
emerging pathogen. Earlier studies had shown that purified toxin A alone was 
able to induce C. difficile disease pathology and that purified toxin B was not 
effective unless it was co-administered with toxin A, suggesting that the toxins 
act synergistically. In this addendum we discuss this paradigm-shifting 
conclusion in the context of current strain epidemiology, particularly with 
respect to naturally occurring toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive isolates and 
the NAP1/027 epidemic isolates. The role of toxin receptors and how variant 
toxins might exert their effects is also discussed in relation to the published 
data. We conclude that it is critical to use the natural infection process to 
dissect the role of toxins in disease, and that future studies are contingent on 
such work. The impact and importance of animal models of C. difficile virulence 
are therefore considered within this frame of reference.
