OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of oral supplementation of the gut enzyme 
intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) in preventing antibiotic-associated 
infections from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and 
Clostridium difficile.
BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health and 
well-being. Antibiotics inherently cause dysbiosis, an imbalance in the number 
and composition of intestinal commensal bacteria, which leads to susceptibility 
to opportunistic bacterial infections. Previously, we have shown that IAP 
preserves the normal homeostasis of intestinal microbiota and that oral 
supplementation with calf IAP (cIAP) rapidly restores the normal gut flora. We 
hypothesized that oral IAP supplementation would protect against 
antibiotic-associated bacterial infections.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were treated with antibiotic(s) Â± cIAP in the drinking 
water, followed by oral gavage of S. Typhimurium or C. difficile. Mice were 
observed for clinical conditions and mortality. After a defined period of time, 
mice were killed and investigated for hematological, inflammatory, and 
histological changes.
RESULTS: We observed that oral supplementation with cIAP during antibiotic 
treatment protects mice from infections with S. Typhimurium as well as with C. 
difficile. Animals given IAP maintained their weight, had reduced clinical 
severity and gut inflammation, and showed improved survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral IAP supplementation protected mice from antibiotic-associated 
bacterial infections. We postulate that oral IAP supplementation could represent 
a novel therapy to protect against antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), C. 
difficile-associated disease (CDAD), and other enteric infections in humans.
