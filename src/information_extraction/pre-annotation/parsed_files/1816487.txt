A mutant of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Don cells), resistant against 
Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, was isolated after mutagenization with 
ethylmethanesulphonate and a two-step selection with toxin B. The mutant, termed 
CdtR-Q, was 10(4) times more resistant to toxin B than wild-type cells and 
cross-resistant to toxin A (10(3) times more resistant). The resistance was 
overcome by increasing the dose of toxin. The resistance has been stable after 
cultivation for 40 generations in the absence of toxin. The morphology of the 
mutant was more epithelial-like than that of the fibroblast parental cells. The 
plating efficiency was about half that of the wild-type, whereas the growth rate 
was the same. The mutant was significantly less sensitive than the wild-type to 
the microfilament-interacting cytochalasins B and D. It was as sensitive as the 
wild-type to endocytosed toxins (diphtheria, pertussis, ricin), to 
microtubule-interacting agents (colchicine, gossypol, nocodazole, taxol, 
vinblastine), and to membrane-damaging toxins with different mechanisms of 
action, with one exception; the mutant was more highly sensitive to the action 
of phospholipase C (with broad substrate-specificity) than the wild-type. The 
results suggest that the mutant has a normal endocytosis, and that the mutation 
does not affect the microtubuli. The results are consistent with a mutation 
affecting the microfilaments in the cytoskeleton.
