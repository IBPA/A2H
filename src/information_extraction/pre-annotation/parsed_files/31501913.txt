Therapeutic regimens using monoclonal antibodies have been implemented in 
clinical daily practice for various gastroenterological diseases, for 
therapeutic strategies in gastrointestinal (GI) oncology, and infectious 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The main indications remain the therapy 
of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and in GI oncology. A new field has opened 
for targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies of recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infection. In the nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies, the endings 
of the substances indicate the production or degree of "humanization" of the 
respective antibodies ("umab": fully human, recombinant antibody; "ximab": 
chimeric antibody with variable murine domain). For chronic inflammatory bowel 
disease, monoclonal antibodies has been developed to interfere with molecular 
targets of the inflammatory cascade in the underlying pathogenesis (tumor 
necrosis factor‑α, interleukin-12 and -23; α4β7-integrins). The development of 
targeted therapies in the treatment of GI malignancies, monoclonal antibodies 
has been developed to interfere with substantial pathways of proliferation and 
apoptosis as well as neoplastic vascularization and neovascularization (e.g., 
vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and VEGF receptor antibodies, 
epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, HER2/neu antibodies). In the 
current review, we provide a summary of the current applications of monoclonal 
antibodies in the therapeutic treatment of gastroenterological diseases.
