The ability of viable and nonviable Saccharomyces boulardii to protect 
gnotobiotic mice from Clostridium difficile induced mortality was tested. With 
the exception of irradiated S. boulardii, which retained some activity, only 
viable yeast protected the mice from lethality. The survival of C. difficile 
infected mice was dependent on the dose of the yeast provided in the drinking 
water.
