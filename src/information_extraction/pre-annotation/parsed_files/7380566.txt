Germfree mice associated with Clostridium difficile developed intestinal disease 
characterized by polymorphonuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria, 
diarrhea, and cecal cytotoxin concentrations positive at a 10(-6) dilution. The 
numbers of viable bacteria never exceeded 10(10) colony-forming units per g (dry 
weight). Despite the high toxin levels and chronic inflammation over a 30-day 
period, the mortality rate was low (less than 2%). Daily treatment of these 
animals with two oral doses of 2 mg of vancomycin resulted in stool levels of 
greater than 200 micrograms/ml, well in excess of the minimum inhibitory 
concentration for C. difficile. This therapy decreased viable cell density by 2 
to 3 logs and increased the spore counts from 10(5.8) to 10(7.8) colony-forming 
units per g (dry weight) by day 7, and animals were free of detectable toxin. 
However, once therapy was stopped, viable bacteria and spore counts and 
cytotoxin concentrations returned to previous levels. Treatment of mice with 
concentrations of clindamycin shown to be inhibitory in vitro had no effect on 
C. difficile toxin titers or bacterial counts, although the appearance of a 
clindamycin-resistant population was noted. These data indicate that vancomycin, 
given orally, decreases the concentration of toxin, but C. difficile survive as 
spores. By contrast, large populations of vegetative cells and high cytotoxin 
levels persist when clindamycin is used, even at an inhibitory concentration.
