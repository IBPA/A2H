BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is the 
leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the United States. C difficile toxins 
TcdA and TcdB breach the intestinal barrier and trigger mucosal inflammation and 
intestinal damage. The inflammasome is an intracellular danger sensor of the 
innate immune system. In the present study, we hypothesize that TcdA and TcdB 
trigger inflammasome-dependent interleukin (IL)-1beta production, which 
contributes to the pathogenesis of CDAD.
METHODS: Macrophages exposed to TcdA and TcdB were assessed for IL-1beta 
production, an indication of inflammasome activation. Macrophages deficient in 
components of the inflammasome were also assessed. Truncated/mutated forms of 
TcdB were assessed for their ability to activate the inflammasome. The role of 
inflammasome signaling in vivo was assessed in ASC-deficient and IL-1 receptor 
antagonist-treated mice.
RESULTS: TcdA and TcdB triggered inflammasome activation and IL-1beta secretion 
in macrophages and human mucosal biopsy specimens. Deletion of Nlrp3 decreased, 
whereas deletion of ASC completely abolished, toxin-induced IL-1beta release. 
TcdB-induced IL-1beta release required recognition of the full-length toxin but 
not its enzymatic function. In vivo, deletion of ASC significantly reduced 
toxin-induced inflammation and damage, an effect that was mimicked by 
pretreatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
CONCLUSIONS: TcdA and TcdB trigger IL-1beta release by activating an 
ASC-containing inflammasome, a response that contributes to toxin-induced 
inflammation and damage in vivo. Pretreating mice with the IL-1 receptor 
antagonist anakinra afforded the same level of protection that was observed in 
ASC-/- mice. These data suggest that targeting inflammasome or IL-1beta 
signaling may represent new therapeutic targets in the treatment of CDAD.
