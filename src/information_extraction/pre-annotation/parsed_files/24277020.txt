Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of health care-associated diarrhea with 
significant morbidity and mortality, and new options for the treatment of C. 
difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) are needed. Cadazolid is a new 
oxazolidinone-type antibiotic that is currently in clinical development for 
treatment of CDAD. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial 
evaluation of cadazolid against C. difficile. Cadazolid showed potent in vitro 
activity against C. difficile with a MIC range of 0.125 to 0.5 Î¼g/ml, including 
strains resistant to linezolid and fluoroquinolones. In time-kill kinetics 
experiments, cadazolid showed a bactericidal effect against C. difficile 
isolates, with >99.9% killing in 24 h, and was more bactericidal than 
vancomycin. In contrast to metronidazole and vancomycin, cadazolid strongly 
inhibited de novo toxin A and B formation in stationary-phase cultures of 
toxigenic C. difficile. Cadazolid also inhibited C. difficile spore formation 
substantially at growth-inhibitory concentrations. In the hamster and mouse 
models for CDAD, cadazolid was active, conferring full protection from diarrhea 
and death with a potency similar to that of vancomycin. These findings support 
further investigations of cadazolid for the treatment of CDAD.
