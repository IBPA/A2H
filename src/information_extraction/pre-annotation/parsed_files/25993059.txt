Novel cyclic lipopeptides with different acyl tails were synthesized via a 
semisynthetic approach. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that 
lipophilicity, chain length, and the location of key aromatic functionalities of 
the tail modulated activity. The lead compound surotomycin exhibited 
significantly improved in vitro activity compared with daptomycin (MIC90 0.5 vs 
2 Î¼g/mL) against Clostridium difficile including NAP1 epidemic strains. In 
hamster efficacy studies, surotomycin protected animals at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 
PO.
