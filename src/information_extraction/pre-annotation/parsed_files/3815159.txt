Oral preventive treatment of gnotobiotic mice by Saccharomyces boulardii 
significantly decreased mortality following Clostridium difficile infection. A 
single S. boulardii ingestion protected 16% of mice, whereas 56% were protected 
when S. boulardii was given continuously in the drinking water. No direct 
antagonistic effect of the yeast on C. difficile numbers was detected, whereas a 
modulation of fecal cytotoxin production was demonstrated.
