There is growing interest in the ability of the intestinal microbiome to 
influence host function within and beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Here we 
review evidence of microbiome-brain interactions in mice and focus on the 
ability to transfer behavioral traits between mouse strains using fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT). Transplantation alters brain chemistry and 
behavior in recipient ex-germ free mice, raising the possibility of using FMT 
for disorders of the central nervous system, and prompting caution in the 
selection of FMT donors for conditions that may include refractory Clostridium 
difficile infection, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease in humans.
