BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 
position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was 
evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, 
ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the 
reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, 
Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 
28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella 
catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 
28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active 
than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally 
susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. 
In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% 
of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 
in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
