Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium 
that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract. This pathogen causes 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in animals and humans. 
Antibiotic-associated diseases may be treated with probiotics, and interest is 
increasing in such uses of probiotics. This study investigated the effect of 
Lactobacillus strains on the quorum-sensing signals and toxin production of C. 
difficile. In addition, an in vivo experiment was designed to assess whether 
Lactobacillus acidophilus GP1B is able to control C. difficile-associated 
disease. Autoinducer-2 activity was measured for C. difficile using the Vibrio 
harveyi coupled bioluminescent assay. Cell extract (10μg/mL) of L. acidophilus 
GP1B exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among 5 to 40μg/mL cell-extract 
concentrations. Real-time PCR data indicated decreased transcriptional levels in 
luxS, tcdA, tcdB, and txeR genes in the presence of 10μg/mL of cell extract of 
L. acidophilus GP1B. Survival rates at 5d for mice given the pathogen alone with 
L. acidophilus GP1B cell extract or L. acidophilus GP1B were 10, 70, and 80%, 
respectively. In addition, the lactic acid-produced L. acidophilus GP1B exhibits 
an inhibitory effect against the growth of C. difficile. Both the L. acidophilus 
GP1B and GP1B cell extract have significant antipathogenic effects on C. 
difficile.
