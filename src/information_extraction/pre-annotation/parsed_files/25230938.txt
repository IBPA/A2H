The bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) stimulates inflammation 
by initiating innate immune cell recruitment and triggering the release of 
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These properties make c-di-GMP a 
promising candidate for use as a vaccine adjuvant, and numerous studies have 
demonstrated that administration of purified c-di-GMP with different antigens 
increases protection against infection in animal models. Here, we have developed 
a novel approach to produce c-di-GMP inside host cells as an adjuvant to exploit 
a host-pathogen interaction and initiate an innate immune response. We have 
demonstrated that c-di-GMP can be synthesized in vivo by transducing a 
diguanylate cyclase (DGC) gene into mammalian cells using an adenovirus serotype 
5 (Ad5) vector. Expression of DGC led to the production of c-di-GMP in vitro and 
in vivo, and this was able to alter proinflammatory gene expression in murine 
tissues and increase the secretion of numerous cytokines and chemokines when 
administered to animals. Furthermore, coexpression of DGC modestly increased 
T-cell responses to a Clostridium difficile antigen expressed from an adenovirus 
vaccine, although no significant differences in antibody titers were observed. 
This adenovirus c-di-GMP delivery system offers a novel method to administer 
c-di-GMP as an adjuvant to stimulate innate immunity during vaccination.
