Inoculation of axenic mice with Clostridium difficile strains induced a 
significant reduction in ceca weight (dry or wet), whereas a nontoxinogenic 
strain led to a partial reduction. A strain, which produces cytotoxin and no 
enterotoxin in vivo, caused a reduction similar to that observed with a 
nontoxinogenic strain. Simultaneous cytotoxin and enterotoxin production by 
various C. difficile strains caused the cecum size to diminish to that observed 
for conventional control mice.
