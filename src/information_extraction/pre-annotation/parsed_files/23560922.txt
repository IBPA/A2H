Clostridium difficile is responsible for thousands of deaths each year and a 
vaccine would be welcomed, especially one that would disrupt bacterial 
maintenance, colonization and persistence in carriers and convalescent patients. 
Structural explorations at the University of Guelph (ON, Canada) discovered that 
C. difficile may express three phosphorylated polysaccharides, named PSI, PSII 
and PSIII; this review captures our recent efforts to create vaccines based on 
these glycans, especially PSII, the common antigen that has precipitated 
immediate attention. The authors describe the design and immunogenicity of 
vaccines composed of raw polysaccharides and conjugates thereof. So far, it has 
been observed that anti-PSII antibodies can be raised in farm animals, mice and 
hamster models; humans and horses carry anti-PSII IgA and IgG antibodies from 
natural exposure to C. difficile, respectively; phosphate is an indispensable 
immunogenic epitope and vaccine-induced PSII antibodies recognize PSII on C. 
difficile outer surface.
