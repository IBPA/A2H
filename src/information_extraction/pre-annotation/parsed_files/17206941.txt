BACKGROUND: Tolevamer is a novel toxin-binding polymer that is currently being 
investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of patients who have 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea.
AIMS: To summarize the results of in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies of 
tolevamer. In contrast to antibiotics, tolevamer binds C. difficile toxins to 
interrupt toxin-mediated intestinal inflammation and tissue damage, and does not 
demonstrate direct antimicrobial activity.
METHODS: Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were studied in rats and dogs; 
efficacy was studied in a hamster model.
RESULTS: Studies in rats and dogs indicate that tolevamer is essentially 
non-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and show that drug interactions 
with commonly used therapies are unlikely. Pharmacologic studies indicate that 
tolevamer reduces disease severity and recurrence rates in the hamster model of 
C. difficile-associated diarrhoea and blocks the enterotoxic effects of toxin A 
in rat ileum. The binding parameters calculated for the interaction of tolevamer 
with toxins A and B provide a reasonable physicochemical model that supports the 
potential clinical utility of tolevamer.
CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical results are consistent with the effectiveness and 
safety profile of tolevamer observed in clinical studies in patients with C. 
difficile-associated diarrhoea.
