Hamster flora introduced into germfree mice reduced the cecum to conventional 
size, suppressed populations of Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile to 
the same degree that mouse flora did, and corrected the hypocellularity that is 
characteristic of the small bowel of germfree mice. A highly toxigenic strain of 
C. difficile readily induced cecitis in germfree and antibiotic-treated 
conventional mice, and histological examination frequently revealed 
pseudomembranes. Toxins A and B were both detected in ceca of animals with 
colitis. Gnotobiotic mice provide a model in which to study the role of the 
indigenous microflora in protecting against antibiotic-associated colitis.
