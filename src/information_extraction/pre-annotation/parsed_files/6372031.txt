In the late 1970s it was found that Clostridium difficile causes a lethal, 
clindamycin-induced ileocecitis in the Syrian hamster; this animal model has 
been an invaluable aid to our understanding of antimicrobial agent-induced 
diarrhea in humans. C. difficile is involved in almost all cases of 
pseudomembranous colitis and in approximately one-fourth of cases of 
antimicrobial agent-associated diarrhea in humans in which a pseudomembrane is 
not detected. The presenting signs and symptoms of C. difficile-induced diarrhea 
are quite variable. Mild diarrhea may be the only finding in the least severe 
form of disease, whereas patients with severe disease may have high fever, 
leukocytosis, severe abdominal cramping, marked abdominal tenderness, and 
profuse diarrhea. Occasionally, symptoms may be so marked as to simulate an 
acute intraabdominal catastrophe. Diagnosis of C. difficile-induced disease 
usually is made by detecting C. difficile cytotoxin in the feces of a patient. 
Assay for cytotoxin in feces of infants is not reliable for diagnosis, however, 
because of the high incidence of an asymptomatic carrier state in this group. 
Appropriate therapy includes discontinuation of the offending antimicrobial 
agent and administration of oral vancomycin when specific antibacterial 
treatment is indicated.
