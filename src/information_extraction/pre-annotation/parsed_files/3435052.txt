Cytotoxin production by human (VP1) and hare (FD) strains of Clostridium 
difficile were compared both in vitro in a broth culture and in vivo in 
intestinal contents of gnotobiotic rodents. Strain VP1 produced about 1,000 
times more cytotoxin than the FD strain, both in vitro and in vivo, although the 
population levels of the two strains were not significantly different either in 
vitro or in vivo. Ninety percent of gnotobiotic rats and 100% of gnotobiotic 
mice established with the VP1 strain died within 3 days, whereas no mortality in 
rats or mice was observed with the FD strain. The cytotoxin titre increased 
during the 3 weeks following establishment of the FD strain in mice, decreasing 
thereafter. Mice previously established with the FD strain were protected from 
VP1 strain challenge. Cytotoxin production was greatly decreased in diassociated 
mice, although the population levels of the two strains did not differ to a 
great extent.
