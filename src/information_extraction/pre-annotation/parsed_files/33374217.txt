Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central 
nervous system (CNS). Recent studies suggest that migration of Th1 and Th17 
cells specific for enteric bacteria from the gut to the CNS may lead to the 
initiation and/or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases including MS. Human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR15 is an MHC class II (MHCII) haplotype highly 
associated with the development of MS that contains the two HLA-DRB* genes, 
DRB1*1501 (DR2b) and DRB5*0101 (DR2a). To identify enteric bacteria which harbor 
antigenic epitopes that activate myelin-specific T cells and drive CNS 
inflammation, we screened for enteric bacteria which express cross-reactive 
epitopes ('mimotopes') of an immunodominant myelin basic protein 89-98 
(MBP89-98) epitope. Based on known MHCII HLA-DR2a amino acid binding motifs and 
cultivation with splenic T cells isolated from MBP-T cell receptor (TCR)/DR2a 
transgenic (Tg) mice, we discovered that a certain variant of surface layer 
protein A (SLPA), which is expressed by a subtype of Clostridioides difficile, 
contains an amino acid sequence that activates MBP89-98-reactive T cells. 
Furthermore, activation of MBP-specific T cells by SLPA upon active immunization 
induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in MBP-TCR/DR2a Tg mice. 
This study suggests that a unique strain of C. difficile possesses an 
encephalitogenic mimotope of MBP that activates autoreactive, myelin-specific T 
cells.
