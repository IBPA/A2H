Clostridium difficile toxin A causes acute gut inflammation in animals and 
humans. It is known to downregulate the tight junctions between colonic 
epithelial cells, allowing luminal contents to access body tissues and trigger 
acute immune responses. However, it is not yet known whether this loss of the 
barrier function is a critical factor in the progression of toxin A-induced 
pseudomembranous colitis. We previously showed that NADH:quinone oxidoreductase 
1 (NQO1) KO (knockout) mice spontaneously display weak gut inflammation and a 
marked loss of colonic epithelial tight junctions. Moreover, NQO1 KO mice 
exhibited highly increased inflammatory responses compared with NQO1 WT 
(wild-type) control mice when subjected to DSS-induced experimental colitis. 
Here, we tested whether toxin A could also trigger more severe inflammatory 
responses in NQO1 KO mice compared with NQO1 WT mice. Indeed, our results show 
that C. difficile toxin A-mediated enteritis is significantly enhanced in NQO1 
KO mice compared with NQO1 WT mice. The levels of fluid secretion, villus 
disruption, and epithelial cell apoptosis were also higher in toxin A-treated 
NQO1 KO mice compared with WT mice. The previous and present results 
collectively show that NQO1 is involved in the formation of tight junctions in 
the small intestine, and that defects in NQO1 enhance C. difficile toxin 
A-induced acute inflammatory responses, presumably via the loss of epithelial 
cell tight junctions.
