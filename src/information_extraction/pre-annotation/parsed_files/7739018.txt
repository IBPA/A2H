Clostridium difficile is isolated from the intestinal tracts of > 50% of healthy 
infants. The mechanism by which intestinal colonisation of infants by toxigenic 
C. difficile is generally asymptomatic is unknown but may reflect the presence 
in human milk of neutralising activity against C. difficile toxin A. On this 
basis, the ability of human milk to inhibit the binding of toxin A to a purified 
hamster brush border membrane receptor was determined. Ten milk samples from 
healthy volunteers in various stages of lactation inhibited the binding of toxin 
A to the receptor by an average of 90%. Heating and dialysis did not 
significantly alter the inhibitory activity of any of the milk samples. Human 
milk protected adult hamsters against a lethal challenge with toxin A but had no 
effect on the cytotoxic activity of the toxin. SDS-PAGE and ligand blot analyses 
showed that there were at least four distinct factors in human milk that 
specifically bound toxin A. Thiophilic adsorption chromatography was used to 
separate immunoglobulin from non-immunoglobulin components of human milk. IgA 
was the only immunoglobulin detected in human milk and > 90% of this 
immunoglobulin was recovered after purification by thiophilic adsorption. Both 
the unbound non-immunoglobulin and bound immunoglobulin fractions of human milk 
inhibited the binding of toxin A to the purified receptor. These results suggest 
that human milk may be important in protecting infants against C. 
difficile-associated intestinal disease.
