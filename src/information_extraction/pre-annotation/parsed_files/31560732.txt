Clostridium difficile (Cd) infection (CDI) typically occurs after antibiotic 
usage perturbs the gut microbiota. Mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) 
are found in the gut and their development is dependent on Major 
histocompatibility complex-related protein 1 (MR1) and the host microbiome. Here 
we were interested in determining whether the absence of MR1 impacts resistance 
to CDI. To this end, wild-type (WT) and MR1-/- mice were treated with 
antibiotics and then infected with Cd spores. Surprisingly, MR1-/- mice 
exhibited resistance to Cd colonization. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of feces 
revealed inherent differences in microbial composition. This colonization 
resistance was transferred from MR1-/- to WT mice via fecal microbiota 
transplantation, suggesting that MR1-dependent factors influence the microbiota, 
leading to CDI susceptibility.
