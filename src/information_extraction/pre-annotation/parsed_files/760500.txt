The hamster model of enterocolitis after the administration of clindamycin was 
used to study various drugs used in treatment of the disease in humans. Current 
evidence strongly suggests toxigenic, clindamycin-resistant Clostridium 
difficile is a cause of the disease in hamster and man. This organism is 
susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole, and the disease could be prevented 
in the hamster so long as the antibiotics were given orally. A fatal colitis 
almost invariably ensued once they were discontinued. Administration of 
cholestyramine significantly prolonged survival of hamsters, but did not pervent 
death or colitis. Corticosteroids or atropine-diphenoxylate (Lomotil) did not 
alter the disease. The hamster model may be useful in studying other kinds of 
treatment of this disease.
