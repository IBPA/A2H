Hamsters treated with vancomycin developed enterocolitis significantly more 
often in a conventional animal room than in a room designed to prevent 
cross-infection with Clostridium difficile. In the conventional room C. 
difficile was isolated from cages, food racks, floors, buckets, the hands of 
caretakers, and the stools of animals with enterocolitis but not from untreated 
hamsters, air, or food from freshly opened bags. C. difficile was not isolated 
from environmental sources in the clean room. It was not possible to determine 
which of the sources of the organism was most important in its spread. 
Cross-infection with C. difficile may be important in the pathogenesis of 
antibiotic-associated enterocolitis in hamster colonies.
