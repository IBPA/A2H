Toxin A (TxA) of Clostridium difficile induces acute inflammation of the 
intestine initiated by release of substance P (SP) and activation of the 
neurokinin-1 receptor. However, the mechanisms that terminate this response are 
unknown. We determined whether the SP-degrading enzyme neutral endopeptidase 
(NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) terminates TxA-induced enteritis. We used both genetic 
deletion and pharmacological inhibition of NEP to test this hypothesis. In 
wild-type mice, instillation of TxA (0.5-5 microg) into ileal loops for 3 h dose 
dependently increased ileal fluid secretion, stimulated granulocyte 
transmigration determined by myeloperoxidase activity, and caused histological 
damage characterized by depletion of enterocytes, edema, and neutrophil 
accumulation. Deletion of NEP reduced the threshold secretory and inflammatory 
dose of TxA and exacerbated the inflammatory responses by more than twofold. 
This exacerbated inflammation was prevented by pretreatment with recombinant 
NEP. Conversely, pretreatment of wild-type mice with the NEP inhibitor 
phosphoramidon exacerbated enteritis. Thus NEP terminates enteritis induced by 
C. difficile TxA, underlying the importance of SP degradation in limiting 
neurogenic inflammation.
