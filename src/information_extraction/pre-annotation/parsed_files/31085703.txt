Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 
adults. During infection, C. difficile must detect the host environment and 
induce an appropriate survival strategy. Signal transduction networks involving 
serine/threonine kinases (STKs) play key roles in adaptation, as they regulate 
numerous physiological processes. PrkC of C. difficile is an STK with two PASTA 
domains. We showed that PrkC is membrane associated and is found at the septum. 
We observed that deletion of prkC affects cell morphology with an increase in 
mean size, cell length heterogeneity, and presence of abnormal septa. A ΔprkC 
mutant was able to sporulate and germinate but was less motile and formed more 
biofilm than the wild-type strain. Moreover, a ΔprkC mutant was more sensitive 
to antimicrobial compounds that target the cell envelope, such as the secondary 
bile salt deoxycholate, cephalosporins, cationic antimicrobial peptides, and 
lysozyme. This increased susceptibility was not associated with differences in 
peptidoglycan or polysaccharide II composition. However, the ΔprkC mutant had 
less peptidoglycan and released more polysaccharide II into the supernatant. A 
proteomic analysis showed that the majority of C. difficile proteins associated 
with the cell wall were less abundant in the ΔprkC mutant than the wild-type 
strain. Finally, in a hamster model of infection, the ΔprkC mutant had a 
colonization delay that did not significantly affect overall virulence.
