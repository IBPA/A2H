We report the closed genome sequence of a Lactobacillus johnsonii strain 
(NCK2677) that was isolated from a cefoperazone-treated mouse model designed for 
the study of Clostridioides difficile infection. Illumina and Nanopore 
sequencing reads were assembled into a circular 1,951,416-bp chromosome with a 
G+C content of 34.7%, containing 1,865 genes.
