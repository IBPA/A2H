Overgrowth by Clostridium difficile has been reported in conventional mice 
injected intraperitoneally with ampicillin. In this study, we aimed to determine 
which types of indigenous intestinal bacteria were eliminated by ampicillin to 
allow overgrowth by C. difficile. C. difficile overgrowth was associated with a 
decrease in the numbers of lactobacilli, an increase in bacteroidaceae and a 
slight decrease in the frequency of isolation of fusiform-shaped bacteria 
(clostridia). C. difficile cytotoxin was detected in caeca from mice in which 
the numbers of C. difficile were greater than 10(5) per gram of faeces. 
Gnotobiotic mice were inoculated with various groups of intestinal anaerobes to 
determine which members of the indigenous flora would antagonize C. difficile. 
Gnotobiotic mice inoculated with three strains of lactobacilli, 37 strains of 
bacteroides or 46 strains of clostridia isolated from limited-flora mice were 
unable to eliminate C. difficile. C. difficile was eliminated, however, from the 
gastrointestinal tracts of gnotobiotic mice inoculated with whole faeces or 
chloroform-treated faeces from conventional mice or whole faeces from 
limited-flora mice containing only clostridia.
