The Clostridium difficile toxin B is one of the main virulence factors and plays 
an important role in the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection (CDI). We 
recently revealed crucial residues in the translocation domain of TcdB for the 
pore formation and toxin translocation. In this study, we investigated the 
effects of mutating a critical site involved in pore formation, Leu-1106, to 
residues that differ in size and polarity (Phe, Ala, Cys, Asp). We observed a 
broad range of effects on TcdB function in vitro consistent with the role of 
this site in pore formation and translocation. We show that mice challenged 
systemically with a lethal dose (LD100) of the most defective mutant (L1106K) 
showed no symptoms of disease highlighting the importance of this residue and 
the translocation domain in disease pathogenesis. These findings offer insights 
into the structure function of the toxin translocation pore, and inform novel 
therapeutic strategies against CDI.
