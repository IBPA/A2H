The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and 
characteristics of Clostridium difficile shedding in owned dogs in Nigeria and 
Malawi. Clostridium difficile was isolated from 31/120 (26%) dogs in Nigeria and 
11/92 (12%) dogs in Malawi (p = 0.012). Overall, 22/42 (52%) isolates were 
toxigenic; 17/31 (55%) from Nigeria and 5/11 (45%) from Malawi. All toxigenic 
isolates possessing tcdA and tcdB, and only one also possessed cdtA/B. Sixteen 
different ribotypes were found, ten (63%) of which were non-toxigenic. Most 
isolates corresponded to ribotypes that have been previously identified in 
humans or livestock. The role of dogs in transmission of C. difficile and the 
clinical implications of C. difficile shedding in dogs remain unclear. These 
data indicate that dogs could act as a source of C. difficile for exposure of 
other species, including humans; however, the true risk is unknown. Further 
study of the ecology of C. difficile and the role of dogs in disease of humans 
and other domestic animals is indicated.
