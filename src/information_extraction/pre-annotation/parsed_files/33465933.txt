Microneedles represent an exciting departure from the existing parenteral 
injection paradigm for drug delivery, particularly for the administration of 
vaccines. While the benefit of delivering vaccine antigens to immunocompetent 
tissue in the skin has been established, there have been varying degrees of 
success using microneedles to do so. Here, we investigate the use of silk 
fibroin protein to produce microneedles and evaluate their ability to deliver 
vaccines against influenza, Clostridium difficile, and Shigella. Fibroin protein 
from the silkworm Bombyx mori possesses suitable properties for use in a 
microneedle system, including all-aqueous processing, mechanical strength in 
dried formats, biocompatibility, and the ability to temperature stabilize 
biomacromolecules. As such, this biomaterial combines the processing and 
biocompatibility advantages of a dissolving microneedle system with the product 
stability and mechanical strength of coated insoluble microneedles. Through 
successful vaccination of mice against three separate antigens, we establish 
that silk fibroin is well-suited for use as a solid-coated microneedle delivery 
system and offers long-term potential similar to that of the leading microneedle 
biomaterials.
