Cholestyramine and colestipol were tested for binding of Clostridium difficile 
cytotoxin with use of batch absorption and column chromatography. The toxin was 
bound by both resins and could not be eluted from cholestyramine with either an 
ionic of a pH gradient. Vancomycin bound to cholestyramine more strongly than to 
colestipol. Cholestyramine and vancomycin were also tested for therapeutic 
efficacy in the hamster model of clindamycin-induced cecitis. Both compounds 
delayed death and reduced levels of cytotoxin in stool; these effects were 
greatest for vancomycin. Use of the two compounds in combination reduced 
concentrations of biologically active vancomycin in stool, but the levels still 
exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for C. difficile. These data 
suggest that the therapeutic benefit of cholestyramine in some patients with 
antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis is due to its binding of the C. 
difficile cytotoxin. Since anion-exchange resins also bind vancomycin, caution 
is necessary if resins are used concurrently with vancomycin for therapy.
