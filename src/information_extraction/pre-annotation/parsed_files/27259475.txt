Predicting dynamics of host-microbial ecosystems is crucial for the rational 
design of bacteriotherapies. We present MDSINE, a suite of algorithms for 
inferring dynamical systems models from microbiome time-series data and 
predicting temporal behaviors. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that MDSINE 
significantly outperforms the existing inference method. We then show MDSINE's 
utility on two new gnotobiotic mice datasets, investigating infection with 
Clostridium difficile and an immune-modulatory probiotic. Using these datasets, 
we demonstrate new capabilities, including accurate forecasting of microbial 
dynamics, prediction of stable sub-communities that inhibit pathogen growth, and 
identification of bacteria most crucial to community integrity in response to 
perturbations.
