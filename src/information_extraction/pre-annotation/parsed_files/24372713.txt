Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of bacterial antibiotic-associated 
diarrhoea in hospitals in the developed world. Despite this notoriety, the 
complex mechanisms employed by this pathogen to overcome innate host defences 
and induce fulminant disease are poorly understood. Various animal models have 
been used extensively for C. difficile research to study disease pathogenesis. 
Until recently, the most commonly used C. difficile disease model has utilised 
hamsters; however, mouse and pig models have now been developed that unravel 
different aspects of C. difficile pathology. This review summarises key aspects 
of the small animal models currently used in C. difficile studies with a 
specific focus on major differences between them. Furthermore, this review 
highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each model and illustrates that 
careful consideration is required when selecting models for use in C. difficile 
research.
