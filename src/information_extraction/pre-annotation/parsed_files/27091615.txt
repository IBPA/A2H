Synthetic cell-surface glycans are promising vaccine candidates against 
Clostridium difficile. The complexity of large, highly antigenic and immunogenic 
glycans is a synthetic challenge. Less complex antigens providing similar immune 
responses are desirable for vaccine development. Based on molecular-level 
glycan-antibody interaction analyses, we here demonstrate that the C. difficile 
surface polysaccharide-I (PS-I) can be resembled by multivalent display of 
minimal disaccharide epitopes on a synthetic scaffold that does not participate 
in binding. We show that antibody avidity as a measure of antigenicity increases 
by about five orders of magnitude when disaccharides are compared with 
constructs containing five disaccharides. The synthetic, pentavalent vaccine 
candidate containing a peptide T-cell epitope elicits weak but highly specific 
antibody responses to larger PS-I glycans in mice. This study highlights the 
potential of multivalently displaying small oligosaccharides to achieve 
antigenicity characteristic of larger glycans. The approach may result in more 
cost-efficient carbohydrate vaccines with reduced synthetic effort.
