Fecal microbiota transplantation is now recommended for treating recurrent forms 
of Clostridioides difficile infection. Recent studies have reported protocols 
using capsules of either frozen or freeze-dried stool allowing oral 
administration in in- and out-patient settings. However, a central question 
remains the viability, engraftment, and efficacy of the microbiome over time 
during storage life. This study shows that both the freeze-drying and freezing 
procedures for fecal samples allowed preserving viability, short-chain fatty 
acids concentration, and anti-Clostridioides difficile properties of microbiota 
without significant alteration after storage for 12Â months. Fecal 
transplantation with freeze-dried microbiota allowed engraftment of microbiota 
leading to clearance of Clostridioides difficile infection in a preclinical 
murine model with a survival rate of 70% versus 53-60% in mice treated with 
frozen inocula, and 20% in the untreated group. Moreover, the freeze-dried 
powder can be used to fill oral hard capsules using a very low amount (0.5%) of 
glidant excipient, allowing oral formulation. Altogether, this study showed that 
freeze-dried inocula can be used for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile 
infection with long-lasting stability of the fecal microbiota. This formulation 
facilitates biobanking and allows the use of hard capsules, an essential step to 
simplify patient access to treatment.
