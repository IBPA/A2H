Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacterium that can reside in animals 
and humans. C. difficile infection causes a variety of clinical symptoms, 
ranging from diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Disease is mediated by TcdA and 
TcdB, two large enterotoxins released by C. difficile during colonization of the 
gut. In this study, we evaluated the ability of recombinant toxin fragments to 
induce neutralizing antibodies in mice. The protective efficacies of the most 
promising candidates were then evaluated in a hamster model of disease. While 
limited protection was observed with some combinations, coadministration of a 
cell binding domain fragment of TcdA (TcdA-B1) and the glucosyltransferase 
moiety of TcdB (TcdB-GT) induced systemic IgGs which neutralized both toxins and 
protected vaccinated animals from death following challenge with two strains of 
C. difficile. Further characterization revealed that despite high concentrations 
of toxin in the gut lumens of vaccinated animals during the acute phase of the 
disease, pathological damage was minimized. Assessment of gut contents revealed 
the presence of TcdA and TcdB antibodies, suggesting that systemic vaccination 
with this pair of recombinant polypeptides can limit the disease caused by toxin 
production during C. difficile infection.
