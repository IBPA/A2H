The role of leptin in the mucosal immune response to Clostridium difficile 
colitis, a leading cause of nosocomial infection, was studied in humans and in a 
murine model. Previously, a mutation in the receptor for leptin (LEPR) was shown 
to be associated with susceptibility to infectious colitis and liver abscess due 
to Entamoeba histolytica as well as to bacterial peritonitis. Here we discovered 
that European Americans homozygous for the same LEPR Q223R mutation (rs1137101), 
known to result in decreased STAT3 signaling, were at increased risk of C. 
difficile infection (odds ratio, 3.03; P = 0.015). The mechanism of increased 
susceptibility was studied in a murine model. Mice lacking a functional leptin 
receptor (db/db) had decreased clearance of C. difficile from the gut lumen and 
diminished inflammation. Mutation of tyrosine 1138 in the intracellular domain 
of LepRb that mediates signaling through the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway also resulted 
in decreased mucosal chemokine and cell recruitment. Collectively, these data 
support a protective mucosal immune function for leptin in C. difficile colitis 
partially mediated by a leptin-STAT3 inflammatory pathway that is defective in 
the LEPR Q223R mutation. Identification of the role of leptin in protection from 
C. difficile offers the potential for host-directed therapy and demonstrates a 
connection between metabolism and immunity.
