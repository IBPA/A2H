This study is aimed at the isolation, identification, and characterization of 
potential probiotic strains capable of inhibiting Clostridium difficile in vitro 
and in vivo. Twenty isolates were isolated from infant fecal samples and 
screened against C. difficile using their cell-free supernatant. Only three 
isolates showed maximum inhibition from 56.05 to 60.60%, thus they were 
characterized for probiotic properties and safety. The results obtained approved 
their tolerance to the gastrointestinal tract conditions and safety profile. 
They were identified by sequencing 16S rRNA as Enterococcus faecalis NM815, E. 
faecalis NM915, and Enterococcus faecium NM1015. For in vivo evaluation, a 
viable mixture of these three strains (109 CFU/mL) was administrated to a group 
of mice (treated group) in daily dose for 14 days, then followed by challenge 
with viable C. difficile (105 CFU/mL) in daily dose for 7 days, then a second 
administration of a viable mixture of the three strains was done daily for 
7 days. In addition, the control group was administered PBS buffer only and the 
untreated group received PBS buffer instead of the probiotic mixture before and 
after the challenge with C. difficile. The results obtained from histological 
analysis confirmed the effectiveness of our three potential probiotic strains 
which expressed inhibition of C. difficile and maintained the structural 
integrity of the liver and intestinal cells.
