Antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive 
bacterium that colonizes the colon and is responsible for more than 29,000 
deaths in the United States each year. Hence, C. difficile infection (CDI) poses 
an urgent threat to public health. Antibody-mediated neutralization of TcdA and 
TcdB toxins, the major virulence factors of CDI, represents an effective 
strategy to combat the disease without invoking antibiotic resistance. However, 
current antitoxin approaches are mostly based on parenteral infusion of 
monoclonal antibodies that are costly, narrow spectrum, and not optimized 
against the intestinal disease. Here, we engineered probiotic Saccharomyces 
boulardii to constitutively secrete a single tetra-specific antibody that 
potently and broadly neutralized both toxins and demonstrated protection against 
primary and recurrent CDI in both prophylactic and therapeutic mouse models of 
disease. This yeast immunotherapy is orally administered, can be used 
concurrently with antibiotics, and may have potential as a prophylactic against 
CDI risk and as a therapeutic for patients with CDI.
