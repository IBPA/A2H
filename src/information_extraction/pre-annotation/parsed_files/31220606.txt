Clostridioides difficile is the major etiologic agent of nosocomial bacterial 
diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The pathogenesis of C. difficile 
infection (CDI)involves two cytotoxic enzymes (TcdA, TcdB) that cause colonic 
epithelial damage, fluid accumulation and enteritis. CDI has been demonstrated 
in a variety of animal species and some reports have recently raised the 
importance of wild animals as a reservoir of this pathogen and possible 
transmission to humans and domestic animals. The aim of this study was to 
characterize C. difficile isolates obtained from pet dogs in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil. A total of 50 faecal samples were obtained from healthy and diarrheic 
dogs. Five of fifty samples (10%) grew C. difficile. Of those, three belonged to 
the PCR ribotype 106 (ST 42) and were toxigenic (A+B+). The other two strains 
belonged to the PCR ribotype 010 (ST 15) and were not toxin producers (A-B-). 
None of the isolates tested positive for the binary toxin genes. Considering the 
antimicrobial resistance patterns of all isolates using EUCAST breakpoints, all 
strains were sensitive to metronidazole and vancomycin. However, two strains 
(ribotype 106 and ribotype 010), were resistant to clindamycin (≤256 μg/mL). All 
strains were strong biofilm producers. Our study provides evidence that dogs can 
act as reservoirs for C. difficile epidemic ribotypes.
