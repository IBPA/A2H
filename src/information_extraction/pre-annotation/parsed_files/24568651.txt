BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that 
can reside as a commensal within the intestinal microbiota of healthy 
individuals or cause life-threatening antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 
immunocompromised hosts. C. difficile can also form highly resistant spores that 
are excreted facilitating host-to-host transmission. The C. difficile spo0A gene 
encodes a highly conserved transcriptional regulator of sporulation that is 
required for relapsing disease and transmission in mice.
RESULTS: Here we describe a genome-wide approach using a combined transcriptomic 
and proteomic analysis to identify Spo0A regulated genes. Our results validate 
Spo0A as a positive regulator of putative and novel sporulation genes as well as 
components of the mature spore proteome. We also show that Spo0A regulates a 
number of virulence-associated factors such as flagella and metabolic pathways 
including glucose fermentation leading to butyrate production.
CONCLUSIONS: The C. difficile spo0A gene is a global transcriptional regulator 
that controls diverse sporulation, virulence and metabolic phenotypes 
coordinating pathogen adaptation to a wide range of host interactions. 
Additionally, the rich breadth of functional data allowed us to significantly 
update the annotation of the C. difficile 630 reference genome which will 
facilitate basic and applied research on this emerging pathogen.
