Clostridium difficile infection can occur in the dams of sick foals, but it is 
unknown if mares and foals share the same isolates. In this study, C. difficile 
isolates from fecal samples of 11 mares paired with 11 foals were genotyped by 
arbitrarily primed PCR; two mares and three foals in five mare-foal pairs had 
diarrhea. Fecal immunoassays were utilized to detect C. difficile common antigen 
and toxin A. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) systems were developed to detect 
genes for toxins A and B, as well as for binary toxin B. Sequences of all toxins 
were present in all isolates, although only one horse was positive for toxin A 
on fecal immunoassay. Identical strains of C. difficile were present in 4/11 
(36.4%) mare-foal pairs. Mare-foal pairs can harbor C. difficile subclinically 
and are potential reservoirs for colonization of each other.
