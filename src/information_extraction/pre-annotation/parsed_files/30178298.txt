Mucosal immunizations are convenient ways of vaccination, which do not require 
any trained personnel for administration. One of the major challenges for 
developing an effective mucosal vaccine is finding appropriate adjuvant. 
Bacillus subtilis endospores have been shown to help solving these obstacles 
while serving as a platform for presentation of both, antigens and adjuvants. In 
this study, we have successfully designed and constructed recombinant spores 
displaying an antigen/adjuvant chimeric protein. We have used a fragment of 
Clostridium difficile flagellar cap FliD protein as antigen and VQGEESNDK 
peptide, a fragment of human IL-1β, as adjuvant. Recombinant spores presenting 
FliD were able to elicit immune response in orally immunized mice which could be 
evaluated by detection of FliD-specific IgA antibodies in feces of immunized 
animals. Moreover, the presence of IL-1β fragment significantly changed 
characteristics of elicited immune response. Obtained results show that 
recombinant spores presenting an antigen/adjuvant chimeric protein exhibit both 
properties in mucosal immunization of mice. Moreover, IL-1β fragment could serve 
as valuable adjuvant in B. subtilis spore-based mucosal vaccines.
