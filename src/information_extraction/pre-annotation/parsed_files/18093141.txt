Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of infectious antibiotic-associated 
diarrhoea, particularly among the elderly. Its surface-layer protein (SLP) was 
tested as a vaccine component in a series of immunization and challenge 
experiments with Golden Syrian hamsters, combined with different systemic and 
mucosal adjuvants. Some regimens were also tested in a nonchallenge BALB/c mouse 
model, enabling closer monitoring of the immune response. None of the regimens 
conferred complete protection in the hamster model, and antibody stimulation was 
variable within regimens, and generally modest or poor. Mice displayed stronger 
antibody responses to SLP compared with hamsters. Two hamsters of five given SLP 
with Ribi (monophosphoryl lipid A and synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate) 
survived the challenge, as did two of three given SLP with Ribi and cholera 
toxin. This modest trend to protection is interpreted with caution, because the 
survivors had low anti-SLP serum antibody titres. The hamsters were an outbred 
line, and subject to more genetic variability than inbred animals; however, 
BALB/c mice also showed strongly variable antibody responses. There is a clear 
need for better adjuvants for single-component vaccines, particularly for 
mucosal delivery. The hamster challenge model may need to be modified to be 
useful in active immunization experiments with SLP.
