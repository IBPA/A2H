Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrheal 
disease in many parts of the world. In recent years, distinct genetic variants 
of C. difficile that cause severe disease and persist within health care 
settings have emerged. Highly resistant and infectious C. difficile spores are 
proposed to be the main vectors of environmental persistence and host 
transmission, so methods to accurately monitor spores and their inactivation are 
urgently needed. Here we describe simple quantitative methods, based on purified 
C. difficile spores and a murine transmission model, for evaluating health care 
disinfection regimens. We demonstrate that disinfectants that contain strong 
oxidizing active ingredients, such as hydrogen peroxide, are very effective in 
inactivating pure spores and blocking spore-mediated transmission. Complete 
inactivation of 10⁶ pure C. difficile spores on indicator strips, a six-log 
reduction, and a standard measure of stringent disinfection regimens require at 
least 5 min of exposure to hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV; 400 ppm). In contrast, 
a 1-min treatment with HPV was required to disinfect an environment that was 
heavily contaminated with C. difficile spores (17 to 29 spores/cm²) and block 
host transmission. Thus, pure C. difficile spores facilitate practical methods 
for evaluating the efficacy of C. difficile spore disinfection regimens and 
bringing scientific acumen to C. difficile infection control.
