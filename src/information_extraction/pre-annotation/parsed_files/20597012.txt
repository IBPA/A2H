The Golden Syrian hamster is widely regarded as the most relevant small animal 
model of Clostridium difficile disease as oral infection of animals pre-treated 
with antibiotics reproduces many of the symptoms observed in man. These include 
diarrhoea, histological damage, colonisation of the large bowel and sporulation 
of the organism at the terminal stage of the disease. However, infection results 
in a fatal outcome, which in the past has been used as an experimental endpoint. 
More recently, attempts have been made to refine the model to maximise the 
scientific data generated whilst minimising animal suffering. This has been 
achieved using a combination of qualitative and quantitative measurements taken 
during the course of the infection and at post-mortem. This has allowed timing 
of experiments to be optimised to ensure appropriate monitoring of animals 
during the acute phase of infection and provides opportunities to establish 
appropriate humane endpoints to these experiments.
