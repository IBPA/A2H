Five different toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile of known human 
epidemiologic importance were tested for virulence in hamsters. Three 
strains-types B1, J9, and K14-have caused hospital outbreaks. Type Y2 is 
associated with a high rate of asymptomatic colonization in patients. The fifth 
strain, type CF2, is a toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive strain implicated in 
multiple human cases of C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Groups of 10 hamsters 
per strain were given 1 dose of clindamycin, followed 5 days later with gastric 
inoculation of 100 cfu of C. difficile. Hamsters given types B1, J9, K14, or Y2 
showed 90%-100% colonization (albeit at a slower rate with type Y2) and 100% 
mortality of colonized animals. Hamsters challenged with type CF2 showed 60% (P= 
.01) colonization and 30% mortality (P= .0003). The hamster model demonstrated 
pathogenicity differences between a toxin variant strain and standard toxigenic 
strains but no significant differences among the standard strains.
