In vivo, apoptotic cells are removed by surrounding phagocytes, a process 
thought to be essential for tissue remodeling and the resolution of inflammation 
[1]. Although apoptotic cells are known to be efficiently phagocytosed by 
macrophages, the mechanisms whereby their interaction with the phagocytes 
triggers their engulfment have not been described in mammals. Here, we report 
that primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (using alpha(v)beta(3) 
integrin for apoptotic cell uptake) extend lamellipodia to engulf apoptotic 
cells and form an actin cup where phosphotyrosine accumulates. Rho GTPases and 
PI 3-kinases have been widely implicated in the regulation of the actin 
cytoskeleton [2, 3]. We show that inhibition of Rho GTPases by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B prevents apoptotic cell phagocytosis and inhibits the 
accumulation of both F-actin and phosphotyrosine. Importantly, the Rho GTPases 
Rac1 and Cdc42 are required for apoptotic cell uptake whereas Rho inhibition 
enhances uptake. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 also prevents apoptotic cell 
phagocytosis but has no effect on the accumulation of F actin and 
phosphotyrosine. These results indicate that both Rho GTPases and PI 3-kinases 
are involved in apoptotic cell phagocytosis but that they play distinct roles in 
this process.
