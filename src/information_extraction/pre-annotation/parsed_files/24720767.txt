The BclA protein is a major component of the outermost layer of spores of a 
number of bacterial species and Clostridium difficile carries three bclA genes. 
Using insertional mutagenesis each gene was characterized and spores devoid of 
these proteins had surface aberrations, reduced hydrophobicity and germinated 
faster than wild-type spores. Therefore the BclA proteins were likely major 
components of the spore surface and when absent impaired the protective shield 
effect of this outermost layer. Analysis of infection and colonization in mice 
and hamsters revealed that the 50% infectious dose (ID50 ) of spores was 
significantly higher (2-logs) in the bclA1(-) mutant compared to the isogenic 
wild-type control, but that levels of toxins (A and B) were indistinguishable 
from animals dosed with wild-type spores. bclA1(-) spores germinated faster than 
wild-type spores yet mice were less susceptible to infection suggesting that 
BclA1 must play a key role in the initial (i.e. pre-spore germination) stages of 
infection. We also show that the ID50 was higher in mice infected with R20291, a 
'hypervirulent' 027 strain, that carries a truncated BclA1 protein.
