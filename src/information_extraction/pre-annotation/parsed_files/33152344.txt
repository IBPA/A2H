Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) are the leading cause of nosocomial 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. C. difficile produces dormant spores that serve 
as infectious agents. Bile salts in the gastrointestinal tract signal spores to 
germinate into toxin-producing cells. As spore germination is required for CDI 
onset, anti-germination compounds may serve as prophylactics. CamSA, a synthetic 
bile salt, was previously shown to inhibit C. difficile spore germination in 
vitro and in vivo. Unexpectedly, a single dose of CamSA was sufficient to offer 
multi-day protection from CDI in mice without any observable toxicity. To study 
this intriguing protection pattern, we examined the pharmacokinetic parameters 
of CamSA. CamSA was stable to the gut of antibiotic-treated mice but was 
extensively degraded by the microbiota of non-antibiotic-treated animals. Our 
data also suggest that CamSA's systemic absorption is minimal since it is 
retained primarily in the intestinal lumen and liver. CamSA shows weak 
interactions with CYP3A4, a P450 hepatic isozyme involved in drug metabolism and 
bile salt modification. Like other bile salts, CamSA seems to undergo 
enterohepatic circulation. We hypothesize that the cycling of CamSA between the 
liver and intestines serves as a slow-release mechanism that allows CamSA to be 
retained in the gastrointestinal tract for days. This model explains how a 
single CamSA dose can prevent murine CDI even though spores are present in the 
animal's intestine for up to four days post-challenge.
