We evaluated the isolation and quantitation of Clostridium difficile from 
aqueous and fecal samples utilizing ChromID CDIF and cycloserine, cefoxitin, and 
fructose-containing agar with horse blood and taurocholate media. Growth was 
similar between the two. ChromID CDIF provided enhanced isolation and required 
no ethanol pretreatment to inhibit normal flora. ChromID CDIF also improved 
turn-around time, requiring only 24 hours' incubation.
