Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea and colitis in 
the industrialized world. Disruption of the protective gut microbiota by 
antibiotics enables colonization by multidrug-resistant C. difficile, which 
secrete up to three different protein toxins that are responsible for the 
gastrointestinal sequelae. Oral agents that inhibit the damage induced by 
toxins, without altering the gut microbiota, are urgently needed to prevent 
primary disease and break the cycle of antibiotic-induced disease recurrence. 
Here, we show that the anthelmintic drug, niclosamide, inhibits the pathogenesis 
of all three toxins by targeting a host process required for entry into 
colonocytes by each toxin. In mice infected with an epidemic strain of C. 
difficile, expressing all three toxins, niclosamide reduced both primary disease 
and recurrence, without disrupting the diversity or composition of the gut 
microbiota. Given its excellent safety profile, niclosamide may address an 
important unmet need in preventing C. difficile primary and recurrent diseases.
