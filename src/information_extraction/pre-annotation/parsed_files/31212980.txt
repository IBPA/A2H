Clostridium difficile induces antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to the release 
of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), the latter being its main virulence 
factor. The epidemic strain NAP1/027 has an increased virulence attributed to 
different factors. We compared cellular intoxication by TcdBNAP1 with that by 
the reference strain VPI 10463 (TcdBVPI). In a mouse ligated intestinal loop 
model, TcdBNAP1 induced higher neutrophil recruitment, cytokine release, and 
epithelial damage than TcdBVPI. Both toxins modified the same panel of small 
GTPases and exhibited similar in vitro autoprocessing kinetics. On the basis of 
sequence variations in the frizzled-binding domain (FBD), we reasoned that 
TcdBVPI and TcdBNAP1 might have different receptor specificities. To test this 
possibility, we used a TcdB from a NAP1 variant strain (TcdBNAP1v) unable to 
glucosylate RhoA but with the same receptor-binding domains as TcdBNAP1. Cells 
were preincubated with TcdBNAP1v to block cellular receptors, prior to 
intoxication with either TcdBVPI or TcdBNAP1. Preincubation with TcdBNAP1v 
blocked RhoA glucosylation by TcdBNAP1 but not by TcdBVPI, indicating that the 
toxins use different host factors for cell entry. This crucial difference might 
explain the increased biological activity of TcdBNAP1 in the intestine, 
representing a contributing factor for the increased virulence of the NAP1/027 
strain.
