Twenty eight Clostridium difficile strains were investigated. Eleven strains 
were toxin A and toxin B gene positive. Four strains were negative for both 
genes. These results correlate with results of cytotoxicity assay. We identified 
13 Clostridium difficile strains toxin A gene positive and toxin B gene 
negative.
