Several G protein-coupled receptors which stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) also 
activate phospholipase D (PLD) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we characterized PLD 
activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by the PLC-stimulatory thrombin 
receptor PAR1, in comparison to the endothelin-1 receptor ET(A)R, which induces 
PLD stimulation by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) delta and epsilon. 
Similar to ET(A)R, activation of PAR1 induced PLD stimulation, which, however, 
was insensitive to PKC inhibition. Furthermore, in contrast to ET(A)R, PLD 
stimulation by PAR1 was suppressed by overexpression of regulators of G protein 
signaling specific for G(12)-type G proteins and treatment with brefeldin A, an 
inhibitor of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor 
(ARF) GTPases. On the other hand, inactivation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium 
difficile toxin B and treatment with general tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
suppressed PAR1- and ET(A)R- as well as phorbol ester-induced PLD stimulation 
and was associated with a fall in the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). We conclude that, in contrast to ET(A)R-PLD coupling, 
PAR1-induced cardiomyocyte PLD stimulation is PKC-independent and mediated by 
G(12)-type G proteins and ARF GTPases, while Rho and tyrosine kinases regulate 
PLD stimulation by either receptor, apparently by controlling the cellular level 
of PIP(2), a common regulator of PLD activity.
