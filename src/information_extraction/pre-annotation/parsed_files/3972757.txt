Seven anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci and 12 clostridial species 
were tested for in-vitro and in-vivo susceptibilities to penicillin, 
clindamycin, and metronidazole, used singly or in combination with gentamicin. 
The in-vitro tests consisted of determination of minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MIC), done without or with constant amounts of gentamicin. When 
used alone or in combination with penicillin or metronidazole, gentamicin had 
negligible effects on the bacteria. When used with clindamycin, gentamicin 
significantly reduced the MIC for one strain each of Peptococcus magnus and 
Clostridium difficile. The in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted 
of studying the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous 
injection of bacterial suspensions. Synergy between gentamicin and penicillin, 
clindamycin or metronidazole was shown respectively in five, three and one 
strain. Consistency between in-vitro and in-vivo findings was present in the 
above mentioned strains only between gentamicin and clindamycin. The synergy 
between penicillin, clindamycin or metronidazole and gentamicin in Gram-positive 
anaerobic and facultative organisms may have clinical implications.
