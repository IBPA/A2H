Duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ) is an idiopathic condition in the horse 
characterized by inflammation and oedema of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. 
Clinical signs include colic, ileus, depression, fluid accumulation in the small 
intestine and stomach, and endotoxaemia. The objective of this study was to 
investigate prospectively the role of Clostridium difficile in this idiopathic 
disease. Nasogastric reflux from 10 consecutive cases with DPJ and 16 
consecutive horses with other causes of nasogastric reflux was cultured for C. 
difficile, other Clostridium spp., and Salmonella. Toxigenic strains of C. 
difficile were isolated from 10/10 (100%) of horses with DPJ and 1/16 controls 
(P<0.0001). No other known pathogenic clostridia were isolated from either 
group. Results of this study suggest that C. difficile might be an important 
cause of this syndrome.
