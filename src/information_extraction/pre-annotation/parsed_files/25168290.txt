The emergence of hypervirulent resistant strains have made Clostridium difficile 
a notorious nosocomial pathogen and has resulted in a renewed interest in 
preventive strategies, such as vaccines based on (synthetic) cell wall antigens. 
Recently, the structure of the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of this species has been 
elucidated. Additionally, this LTA was found to induce the formation of 
protective antibodies against C. difficile in rabbits and mice. The LTA from C. 
difficile is isolated as a microheterogenous mixture, differing in size and 
composition, impeding any structure-activity relationship studies. To ensure 
reliable biological results, pure and well-defined synthetic samples are 
required. In this work the total synthesis of LTAs from C. difficile with 
defined chain length is described and the initial biological results are 
presented.
