In this study we identified mechanisms at the colonic mucosa by which MUC2 mucin 
regulated the production of β-defensin in a proinflammatory milieu but 
functionally protected susceptible bacteria from its antimicrobial effects. The 
regulator role of MUC2 on production of β-defensin 2 in combination with the 
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was confirmed using purified 
human colonic MUC2 mucin and colonic goblet cells short hairpin RNA (shRNA) 
silenced for MUC2. In vivo, Muc2(-/-) mice showed impaired β-defensin mRNA 
expression and peptide localization in the colon as compared with Muc2(+/-) and 
Muc2(+/+) littermates. Importantly, purified MUC2 mucin abrogated the 
antimicrobial activity of β-defensin 2 against nonpathogenic and 
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Sodium metaperiodate oxidation of MUC2 
removed the capacity of MUC2 to stimulate β-defensin production and MUC2's 
inhibition of defensin antimicrobial activity. This study highlights that a 
defective MUC2 mucin barrier, typical in inflammatory bowel diseases, may lead 
to deficient stimulation of β-defensin 2 and an unbalanced microbiota that favor 
the growth of β-defensin-resistant microbes such as Clostridium difficile.
