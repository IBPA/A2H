Although Clostridium difficile is recognized as a cause of enterocolitis in 
horses and humans, there has been little work published regarding the lability 
of C. difficile and its toxins in feces. A significant decrease in recovery of 
C. difficile from inoculated equine fecal samples occurred during storage. 
Recovery after storage in air at 4 degrees C decreased from 76% (37/49) after 24 
hours to 67% (33/49) at 48 hours and 29% (14/ 49) after 72 hours. In contrast to 
aerobic storage, 25 of 26 samples stored anaerobically at 4 degrees C yielded 
growth of C. difficile for 30 days, whereas the organism was only detected for 
2.5 +/- 2.52 days (x +/- SD) in paired samples stored aerobically. The use of an 
anaerobic transport medium was effective in maintaining viability of C. 
difficile. These findings indicate that poor aerotolerance is the reason for the 
rapid decrease in culture yield. In contrast to C. difficile organisms stored 
aerobically at 4 degrees C, C. difficile toxins were considerably more stable 
and could be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both broth and 
inoculated fecal samples for at least 30 days. The poor survival of C. difficile 
but the stability of its toxins when feces are stored aerobically must be 
considered when submitting samples for diagnosis of C. difficile-associated 
enterocolitis in horses and when interpreting laboratory results.
