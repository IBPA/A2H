There is no recommended protocol for detecting and isolating Clostridium 
difficile present in food samples. Here, we have evaluated the recovery of C. 
difficile in meat samples after incubating them in various enrichment broths. 
The media were as follows: cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose broth supplemented 
with taurocholic acid, d-cycloserine, cefoxitin, and lysozyme; 
cycloserine-cefoxitin mannitol broth with taurocholate and lysozyme; and 
cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose broth supplemented with taurocholic acid, C. 
difficile moxalactam norfloxacin selective supplement, and lysozyme. Samples 
were inoculated with various strains and quantities of C. difficile and then 
enriched in the different broths for 1, 4, and 7 days. C. difficile was isolated 
on agar plates and detected with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The 
procedure using enrichment in cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose broth supplemented 
with taurocholic acid, d-cycloserine, cefoxitin, and lysozyme and incubation for 
4 days for qPCR detection and 7 days for isolation (plating on C. difficile agar 
base with added C. difficile selective supplement and 7% [v/v] defibrinated 
horse blood after alcoholic shock and centrifugation) was validated. Samples of 
different kinds of meat and meat preparation were contaminated and used for 
validation of the chosen protocol. The sensitivity of detection with qPCR was 
100%, and the sensitivity of the isolation method was 96%.
