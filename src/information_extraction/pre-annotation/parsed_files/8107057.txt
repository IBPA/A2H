The kinetics of the appearance of intestinal lesions induced by orogastric 
inoculation of gnotobiotic mice with a lethal strain of Clostridium difficile 
(VPI) that produced toxins A and B in vivo and in vitro was studied and compared 
with the lesions induced by non-lethal C. difficile strain 786 that produced 
toxins A and B in vitro but only toxin B in measurable amounts in vivo. 
Different portions of the intestine were removed 12, 20, 26 and 30 h after 
inoculation and studied by scanning electronmicroscopy. The remaining portions 
were homogenised for enumeration of C. difficile and quantification of toxin A 
by enzyme immunoassay and toxin B by cytotoxicity. The results showed that, 
following inoculation: (i) measurable amounts of both toxins were necessary to 
produce lesions; (ii) with strain VPI, the caecum and the colon were rapidly 
impaired and completely destroyed after 1 day, whereas the small intestine was 
damaged to a lesser extent; (iii) C. difficile strain 786 did not cause mucosal 
damage but induced mucus-like or serum-like secretion and morphological changes 
in the caecal enterocytes only.
