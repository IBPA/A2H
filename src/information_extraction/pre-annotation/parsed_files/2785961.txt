We have tested the in vitro binding of Clostridium difficile toxin A 
(enterotoxin) and cholera toxin to intestinal brush border membranes prepared 
from either conventional or axenic mice. Membranes from axenic mice were shown 
to be saturated at a lower toxin A concentration (at least 2.5 times lower). 
Because there were no significant differences between membranes from axenic and 
conventional mice in binding at low toxin A concentrations, the presence of the 
normal microflora seems to increase the number but not the affinity of brush 
border membrane receptors on the enterocyte surface. Corroborating the in vitro 
results, we observed that conventional mice were more sensitive to the 
pathological effects of toxin A given intragastrically than were axenic mice. In 
contrast, there was no difference in the binding characteristics of cholera 
toxin between membranes from conventional and axenic mice. We conclude that the 
presence of the mouse intestinal bacteria increases the number of C. difficile 
toxin A intestinal receptors but does not influence cholera toxin receptors.
