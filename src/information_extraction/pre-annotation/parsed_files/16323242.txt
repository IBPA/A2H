To investigate the role of the monomeric guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho 
on migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), we employed different 
clostridial toxins which inhibit the Rho family of GTPases. Pretreatment with 
C2I-C3, a cell-accessible C3 transferase fusion protein that targets Rho, 
increased chemokinetic migration of the factor-dependent multipotent cell line 
Factor Dependent Cell Paterson with mixed lineage differentiation potential 
(FDCP-mix) and of primary lineage marker-depleted HPC in vitro. In contrast, 
treatment with lethal toxin (LT) from Clostridium sordellii, which predominantly 
inactivates Rac, and with toxin B from C. difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac 
and Cdc42, decreased in vitro migration. When HPC pretreated with LT or toxin B 
were transplanted into mice, homing to the bone marrow was impaired, whereas 
C2I-C3 treatment did not alter HPC homing. However, in a competitive 
hematopoietic repopulation experiment in C57BL/6 mice, pretreatment of bone 
marrow cells with any of the inhibitors, including the Rho inhibitor C2I-C3, 
resulted in suppressed donor-type hematopoiesis. Our data indicate that whereas 
Rac supports HPC cell cycling, migration, short-term homing and hematopoietic 
regeneration, Rho coordinates down-regulation of HPC migration and is required 
for hematopoietic regeneration.
