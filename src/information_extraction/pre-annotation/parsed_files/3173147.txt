The cytotoxin produced by Clostridium difficile was highly purified by using 
ammonium sulfate fractionation and successive column chromatographies of 
DEAE-Sephadex A-25, hydroxyapatite, Bio-Gel A-0.5m, Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and 
Mono Q. The purified cytotoxin gave a single band on conventional and sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 
dithiothreitol. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 260,000 and 50,000 by 
gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel 
electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol, respectively. Thus it was 
supposed that the toxin consists of 5 subunits having molecular weight of 
approximately 50,000. It had an isoelectric point of 6.6. The toxin was 
heat-labile (60 C for 10 min) and inactivated by treatment with trypsin and 
pronase, or at pH below 4 or over 10. The minimum cytotoxic dose of the 
cytotoxin against Chinese hamster ovary cells was 3 ng. It was also demonstrated 
that the toxin is antigenically different from enterotoxin of C. difficile.
