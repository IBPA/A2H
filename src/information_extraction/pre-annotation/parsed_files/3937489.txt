Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by 
Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro 
which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these 
glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of 
vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution 
and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In 
vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of 
Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus 
spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of 
Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other 
glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In 
experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, 
S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 
50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after 
infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level 
in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins 
were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in 
mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.
