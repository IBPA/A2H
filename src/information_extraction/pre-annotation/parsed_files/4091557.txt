A semisynthetic diet fed to axenic mice was found to prevent the establishment 
of a Clostridium perenne strain in their intestinal tract. This inhibitory 
effect did not occur when axenic mice were preinoculated with a strain of 
Clostridium difficile. The inhibitory effect was related to the presence in the 
intestinal contents of axenic mice of both dietary copper and a dipeptide, 
aspartic-epsilon-lysine. When C. difficile was inoculated into axenic mice, the 
dipeptide disappeared from the digesta, and C. perenne became established even 
in the presence of high concentrations of copper.
