The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections is highly dynamic as new 
strains continue to emerge worldwide. Here we present a detailed analysis of a 
new C. difficile strain (ICC-45) recovered from a cancer patient in Brazil that 
died from severe diarrhea. A polyphasic approach assigned a new PCR-ribotype and 
PFGE macrorestriction pattern to strain ICC-45, which is toxigenic (tcdA(+), 
tcdB(+) and ctdB(+)) and classified as ST41 from MLST Clade 2 and toxinotype 
IXb. Strain ICC-45 encodes for a variant TcdB that induces a distinct CPE in 
agreement with its toxinotype. Unlike epidemic NAP1/027 strains, which are also 
classified to MLST Clade 2, strain ICC-45 is susceptible to fluoroquinolones and 
does not overproduce toxins TcdA and TcdB. However, supernatants from strain 
ICC-45 and a NAP1/027 strain produced similar expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, epithelial damage, and oxidative stress response in the mouse ileal 
loop model. These results highlight inflammation and oxidative stress as common 
features in the pathogenesis of C. difficile Clade 2 strains. Finally, this work 
contributes to the description of differences in virulence among various 
C. difficile strains.
