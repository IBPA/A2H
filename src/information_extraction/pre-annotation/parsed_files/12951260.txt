Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens type A are infectious agents 
of enteric diseases. The main virulence factors of these microorganisms include 
toxins A and B of C. difficile (ToxA and ToxB) and enterotoxin of C. perfringens 
(Cpe). In this study genetic constructions have been created for the expression 
of ToxA, ToxB and Cpe fragments either as individual components or as a hybrid 
multidomain (ToxA-ToxB-Cpe) protein. Rabbit monospecific sera raised against 
individual peptides reacted with the chimeric product indicating that the 
corresponding antigenic determinants were correctly expressed on the hybrid 
molecule. Furthermore, mice immunized with the fusion protein produced 
antibodies specific to each of the three separate components. These data suggest 
that the constructed three-domain molecule could be used in future studies for 
development of a vaccine against enteric clostridial diseases.
