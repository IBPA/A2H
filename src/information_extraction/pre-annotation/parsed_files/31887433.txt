Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become a growing health concern, as 
evident from the increase in the mortality rate among elderly or hospitalized 
patients. Treatment of CDI is usually based on antibiotics (metronidazole and 
vancomycin), but it has some limitations, including cost and antibiotic 
resistance. Probiotics could offer an effective remedy to prevent CDI and could 
be an auxiliary agent in treatment CDI. Here, the anti-clostridial activity of a 
newly isolated probiotic strain, Pediococcus acidilactici SPM138 (SPM138) was 
evaluated. The cultivation of C. difficile (CD) with SPM138, inhibited the 
growth of CD and significantly reduced CD toxins level. The result of MTT assay 
showed that, incubation with 25% CD culture supernatant decreased the survival 
rate of HT-29 cells to less than 20%. However, the survival rate of these cells 
increased to 98% in the presence of the 25% CD + SPM138 supernatant. The mRNA 
expression of IL-6, IL-8 and PTGS2 in HT-29 cells decreased by more than 60% 
upon incubation with CD + SPM138 co-cultures as compared to the levels observed 
after treatment with CD supernatant only. The concentration of IL-8 also 
decreased by more than 60% upon treatment with CD + SPM138 co-culture 
supernatant. In a C. difficile PCR ribotype 027-infected mouse model, the 
concentration of CD toxin in stool samples of SPM138-fed mice was only 37% of 
that reported in C. difficile 027-infected group. These findings show that 
P. acidilactici SPM138 may be a promising probiotic in CDI.
