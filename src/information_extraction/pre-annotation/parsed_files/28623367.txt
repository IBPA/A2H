The increased incidence of antibiotic resistant 'superbugs' has amplified the 
use of broad spectrum antibiotics worldwide. An unintended consequence of 
antimicrobial treatment is disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, 
resulting in susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridium 
difficile. Paradoxically, treatment of C. difficile infections (CDI) also 
involves antibiotic use, leaving patients susceptible to re-infection. This 
serious health threat has led to an urgent call for the development of new 
therapeutics to reduce or replace the use of antibiotics to treat bacterial 
infections. To address this need, we have developed colostrum-derived antibodies 
for the prevention and treatment of CDI. Pregnant cows were immunised to 
generate hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC) containing antibodies that target 
essential C. difficile virulence components, specifically, spores, vegetative 
cells and toxin B (TcdB). Mouse infection and relapse models were used to 
compare the capacity of HBC to prevent or treat primary CDI as well as prevent 
recurrence. Administration of TcdB-specific colostrum alone, or in combination 
with spore or vegetative cell-targeted colostrum, prevents and treats C. 
difficile disease in mice and reduces disease recurrence by 67%. C. 
difficile-specific colostrum should be re-considered as an immunotherapeutic for 
the prevention or treatment of primary or recurrent CDI.
