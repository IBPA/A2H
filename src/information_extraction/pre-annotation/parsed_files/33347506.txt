BACKGROUND: A zoonotic association has been suggested for several PCR ribotypes 
(RTs) of Clostridioides difficile. In central parts of Sweden, RT046 was found 
dominant in neonatal pigs at the same time as a RT046 hospital C. difficile 
infection (CDI) outbreak occurred in the southern parts of the country.
OBJECTIVE: To detect possible transmission of RT046 between pig farms and human 
CDI cases in Sweden and investigate the diversity of RT046 in the pig population 
using whole genome sequencing (WGS).
METHODS: WGS was performed on 47 C. difficile isolates from pigs (n = 22), the 
farm environment (n = 7) and human cases of CDI (n = 18). Two different core 
genome multilocus sequencing typing (cgMLST) schemes were used together with a 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis and the results were related to 
time and location of isolation of the isolates.
RESULTS: The pig isolates were closely related (≤6 cgMLST alleles differing in 
both cgMLST schemes) and conserved over time and were clearly separated from 
isolates from the human hospital outbreak (≥76 and ≥90 cgMLST alleles differing 
in the two cgMLST schemes). However, two human isolates were closely related to 
the pig isolates, suggesting possible transmission. The SNP analysis was not 
more discriminate than cgMLST.
CONCLUSION: No general pattern suggesting zoonotic transmission was apparent 
between pigs and humans, although contrasting results from two isolates still 
make transmission possible. Our results support the need for high resolution WGS 
typing when investigating hospital and environmental transmission of C. 
difficile.
