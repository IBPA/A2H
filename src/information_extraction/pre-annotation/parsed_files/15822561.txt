Fourteen dogs had shown chronic or intermittent diarrhea for more than 1 year. 
Diarrhea had been successfully treated with tylosin for at least 6 months but 
recurred when treatment was withdrawn on at least 2 occasions. 
Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) affects typically middle-aged, large-breed 
dogs and clinical signs indicate that TRD affects both the small and large 
intestine. Treatment with tylosin eliminated diarrhea in all dogs within 3 days 
and in most dogs within 24 hours. Tylosin administration controlled diarrhea in 
all dogs, but after it was discontinued, diarrhea reappeared in 12 (85.7%) of 14 
dogs within 30 days. Prednisone given for 3 days did not completely resolve 
diarrhea. Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG did not prevent the relapse of 
diarrhea in any of 9 dogs so treated. The etiology of TRD, a likely form of 
antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD) is unclear. The following reasons for 
chronic diarrhea were excluded or found to be unlikely: parasites, exocrine 
pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial 
overgrowth, enteropathogenic bacteria (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., 
Yersinia spp., or Lawsoni intracellularis), and Clostridium perfringens 
enterotoxin and Clostridium difficile A toxin. A possible etiologic factor is a 
specific enteropathogenic organism that is a common resident in the canine 
gastrointestinal tract and is sensitive to tylosin but difficult to eradicate. 
Additional studies are required to identify the specific cause of TRD.
