Using electron microscopy, ultrastructural organization of microbial parietal 
biofilm in colon of immunodeficient mice line B10-hr(rhy) was studied before and 
after peroral inoculation with enteropathogenic strain of Clostridium difficile. 
It was shown that infection leads to dispersion of normal biofilm in various 
sites and imbalance in natural proportions of different bacterial associations. 
Also, clear ultrastructural signs of involution of Gram-negative microorganisms 
were observed. In the remaining areas of the biofilm, density of bacterial 
population increased. In the same areas massive intrusion of microorganisms in 
epitheliocytes occurred with their subsequent localization in phagosomes, 
phagolysosomes and, in some cases, in the cytoplasm of degenerating eukaryotic 
cells.
