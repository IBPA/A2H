Prior antibiotic treatment is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile 
infection (CDI); the commensal gut microbiota plays a key role in determining 
host susceptibility to the disease. Previous studies demonstrate that the 
pre-colonization of mice with a commensal fungus, Candida albicans, protects 
against a lethal challenge with C. difficile spores. The results reported here 
demonstrate that the cecum contents of antibiotic-treated mice with C. albicans 
colonization contained different levels of several lipid species, including 
non-esterified, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids compared to non-C. 
albicans-colonized mice. Mice fed olive oil for one week and challenged with C. 
difficile spores showed enhanced survival compared to PBS-fed mice. The amount 
of olive oil administered was not sufficient to cause weight gain or to result 
in significant changes to the bacterial microbiota, in contrast to the effects 
of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, the direct exposure of C. difficile bacteria in 
laboratory culture to the unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid, the major fatty 
acid found in olive oil, reduced the transcription of genes encoding the toxins 
and reduced the survival of bacteria in the post-exponential phase. Therefore, 
the effects of C. albicans on the metabolite milieu contributed to the 
attenuation of C. difficile virulence.
