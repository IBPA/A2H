Clostridium difficile may be an emerging community-associated pathogen but 
little is known about its sources of exposure. This study evaluated C. difficile 
contamination in households and colonization of pets. C. difficile was isolated 
from 44/836 (5.3%) sites in 26/84 (31%) households. Ribotype 027 was the most 
common (25%) environmental strain. C. difficile was isolated from 14/139 (10%) 
dogs. Living with an immunocompromised individual was associated with C. 
difficile colonization in dogs. All toxigenic strains identified in pets have 
been isolated from humans in Ontario. C. difficile was isolated concurrently 
from dogs and the environment in four households, but in all cases canine and 
environmental ribotypes were different. C. difficile was relatively common in 
households, suggesting that exposure to this pathogen may be a regular event. 
There was no evidence that dogs are a significant source of household C. 
difficile contamination.
