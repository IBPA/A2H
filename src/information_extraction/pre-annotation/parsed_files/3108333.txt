Virulent toxigenic and avirulent non-toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile 
gave a positive result in the latex agglutination test (LAT) for C difficile 
toxin A (D-1). Similar concentrations of latex agglutinating antigen were 
produced by these strains in vivo. Positive reactions were also given by C 
sporogenes, proteolytic C botulinum Types A, B, and A/F, and Bacteroides 
assaccharolyticus. The latex agglutinating antigen was denatured by boiling for 
10 minutes, but not by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes. The reaction was 
abolished by incubation of test material with crude C difficile antitoxin but 
not with other clostridial antitoxins or specific antitoxin to C difficile toxin 
A. The latex agglutinating antigen present in C difficile eluted between 0.39% 
and 0.47% M sodium chloride, and that produced by the other clostridia, between 
0.35% and 0.43% M sodium chloride by fast protein liquid chromatography. The 
latex agglutinating antigen of C difficile was neither cytotoxic nor mouse 
lethal and was distinct from toxin A and toxin B. In the analysis of faecal 
specimens from patients with diarrhoea the latex agglutination test correlated 
better with the presence of C difficile than with toxin B and detected both 
toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. The latex agglutination test should only be 
used in the laboratory as an alternative to culture for C difficile and not as a 
method for the detection of C difficile toxins.
