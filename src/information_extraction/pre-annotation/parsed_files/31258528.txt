Newly revealed links between inflammation, obesity, and cardiometabolic syndrome 
have created opportunities to try previously unexplored therapeutic modalities 
in these common and life-risking disorders. One potential modulator of these 
complex disorders is the gut microbiome, which was described in recent years to 
be altered in patients suffering from features of cardiometabolic syndrome and 
to transmit cardiometabolic phenotypes upon transfer into germ-free mice. As a 
result, there is great interest in developing new modalities targeting the 
altered commensal bacteria as a means of treatment for cardiometabolic syndrome. 
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is one such modality in which a 
disease-associated microbiome is replaced by a healthy microbiome configuration. 
So far clinical use of FMT has been overwhelmingly successful in recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection and is being extensively studied in other 
microbiome-associated pathologies such as cardiometabolic syndrome. This review 
will focus on the rationale, promises and challenges in FMT utilization in human 
disease. In particular, it will overview the role of the gut microbiota in 
cardiometabolic syndrome and the rationale, experience, and prospects of 
utilizing FMT treatment as a potential preventive and curative treatment of 
metabolic human disease.
