Guinea pigs treated with lincomycin developed colitis, acute cholecystitis and 
abnormalities in red blood cell morphology. The present study was designed to 
study the production of clostridial toxins after lincomycin treatment. 
Lincomycin produced abnormalities in conventional but not in germ-free guinea 
pigs. Clostridium difficile was cultured from cecal contents of conventional 
guinea pigs treated with lincomycin. Cecal filtrate from sick guinea pigs was 
subjected to Sepharose 4B-CL and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, yielding 
a partially purified toxin. Both cecal filtrate and partially purified toxin 
samples contained a heat labile substance which was cytotoxic to human lung 
fibroblast Wl-38 cells, and which was neutralized by Clostridium sordelli 
antitoxin. Toxin samples given orally or intraperitoneally killed normal guinea 
pigs. Finally, toxin samples induced red cell membrane changes in vitro as well 
as producing features of acute inflammation in healthy explants of guinea pig 
cecum and gallbladder in organ culture. Lincomycin treated guinea pigs produced 
Clostridium difficile toxin(s) which in turn caused diffuse cell membrane 
injury.
