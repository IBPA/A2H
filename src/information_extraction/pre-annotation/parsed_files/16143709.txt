OBJECTIVES: Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is limited 
primarily to either metronidazole or vancomycin. We compared vancomycin and a 
novel glycolipodepsipeptide, ramoplanin, in both hamster and in vitro gut models 
of clindamycin-induced CDI.
METHODS: We used an in vitro triple-stage chemostat model that simulates the 
human gut, and an in vivo hamster model, both primed with clindamycin.
RESULTS: Clindamycin exposure elicited symptomatic disease in the hamster model, 
and promoted C. difficile germination and toxin production in the gut model. C. 
difficile germination and toxin production were not associated with depletion of 
gut microflora in the gut model, but were temporarily associated with 
subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin. Both ramoplanin and vancomycin were 
associated with rapid symptom resolution in the hamster model, and rapid toxin 
titre decrease in the in vitro gut model. In both models of CDI, vancomycin was 
associated with greater persistence of C. difficile spores. C. difficile spores 
were recovered significantly more often from the caecal contents of 
vancomycin-treated (n = 19/23) compared with ramoplanin-treated (n = 6/23) 
hamsters (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the in vitro gut and hamster models were concordant. 
Ramoplanin and vancomycin were similarly effective at reducing cytotoxin 
production in the gut CDI model and in resolving symptoms in the hamster model. 
Ramoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin at killing spores and 
preventing spore recrudescence. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic 
role for ramoplanin in CDI that requires further clinical investigation.
