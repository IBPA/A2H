A single-chromosome closed genome of Peptacetobacter (Clostridium) hiranonis 
strain DGF055142 was generated using Illumina MiSeq short reads paired with 
Oxford Nanopore MinION long reads. This isolate was obtained from a canine in 
Flagstaff, Arizona, in 2019. Peptacetobacter (C.) hiranonis was hypothesized to 
contribute to canine Clostridium difficile infection resistance.
