We examined the role of glucocorticoids in acute inflammatory diarrhea mediated 
by Clostridium difficile toxin A. Toxin A (5 microg) or buffer was injected in 
rat ileal loops, and intestinal responses were measured after 30 min to 4 h. 
Ileal toxin A administration increased plasma glucocorticoids after 1 h, at 
which time the toxin-stimulated secretion was not significant. Administration of 
the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone inhibited toxin A-induced intestinal 
secretion and inflammation and downregulated toxin A-mediated increase of 
macrophage inflammatory protein-2. Adrenalectomy followed by replacement with 
glucocorticoids at various doses suggested that intestinal responses to toxin A 
were related to circulating levels of glucocorticoids. Administration of the 
glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 enhanced toxin A-mediated intestinal 
secretion and inflammation. We conclude that C. difficile toxin A causes 
increased secretion of endogenous glucocorticoids, which diminish the intestinal 
secretory and inflammatory effects of toxin A.
