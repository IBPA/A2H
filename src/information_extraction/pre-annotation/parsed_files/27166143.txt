Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a toxin-mediated intestinal disease. 
Toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin are believed to be responsible for the 
pathogenesis of CDI, which is characterized by massive infiltration of 
neutrophils at the infected intestinal mucosa. IL-17 is one of the cytokines 
that play critical roles in several inflammatory and immunological diseases 
through various actions, including promoting neutrophil recruitment. The aim of 
this study was to examine the role of this cytokine in CDI by employing IL-17 A 
and F double knockout (IL-17 KO) mice for the CDI model. We demonstrated that 
IL-17 KO mice were more resistant to CDI than WT mice using several factors, 
such as diarrhoea score, weight change and survival rate. Although the bacterial 
numbers of C. difficile in faeces were not different, the inflammatory mediator 
levels at the large intestine on day 3 post-infection were attenuated in IL-17 
KO mice. Finally, we showed that infiltration of neutrophils, but not 
macrophages, in the large intestine was significantly decreased in IL-17 KO mice 
compared to WT mice. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that endogenous IL-17 
may be a factor determining the severity of CDI in mice. Although the mechanism 
is totally unknown, IL-17-mediated inflammatory responses, such as 
cytokine/chemokine production and neutrophil accumulation, may be plausible 
targets for future investigations.
