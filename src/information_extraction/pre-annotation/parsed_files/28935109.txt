Synthetic oligosaccharide-based vaccines are promising alternatives to 
conventional antibacterial carbohydrate vaccines prepared with isolated 
polysaccharides. Unlike polysaccharides, synthetic glycans are well defined, 
contaminant-free, and accessible even for pathogens that cannot be fermented or 
show limited carbohydrate biosynthesis in vitro. However, identifying synthetic 
glycan B cell epitopes that induce protective immunity has traditionally been a 
time-consuming trial-and-error process, as predicting the immunogenicity of an 
oligosaccharide by means of structure alone is not straightforward. We here 
describe how synthetic oligosaccharide epitopes for candidate vaccines can be 
rationally identified prior to preclinical immunogenicity studies. Epitopes are 
selected on the basis of their recognition by antibodies associated with 
protection from disease in humans or small animals. In addition, we show how 
murine antibody responses to a large oligosaccharide can inform the 
identification of a minimal B cell epitope that may help designing easy to 
synthesize vaccine candidates. The procedures, exemplified with a surface 
carbohydrate of Clostridium difficile, may serve as a guideline for selecting 
protective oligosaccharide epitopes for vaccines against infectious and 
malignant diseases.
