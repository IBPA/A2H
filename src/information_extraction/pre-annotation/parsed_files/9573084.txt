Clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in 
humans through the actions of toxin A and toxin B on the colonic mucosa. At 
present, broad-spectrum antibiotic drugs are used to treat this disease, and 
patients suffer from high relapse rates after termination of treatment. This 
study examined the role of both toxins in pathogenesis and the ability of orally 
administered avian antibodies against recombinant epitopes of toxin A and toxin 
B to treat C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD). DNA fragments representing 
the entire gene of each toxin were cloned, expressed, and affinity purified. 
Hens were immunized with these purified recombinant-protein fragments of toxin A 
and toxin B. Toxin-neutralizing antibodies fractionated from egg yolks were 
evaluated by a toxin neutralization assay in Syrian hamsters. The 
carboxy-terminal region of each toxin was most effective in generating 
toxin-neutralizing antibodies. With a hamster infection model, antibodies to 
both toxins A and B (CDAD antitoxin) were required to prevent morbidity and 
mortality from infection. In contrast to vancomycin, CDAD antitoxin prevented 
relapse and subsequent C. difficile reinfection in the hamsters. These results 
indicate that CDAD antitoxin may be effective in the treatment and management of 
CDAD in humans.
