Currently, the Golden Syrian hamster is widely considered an important model of 
Clostridium difficile disease, as oral infection of this animal pretreated with 
antibiotics reproduces many of the symptoms observed in humans. Two C. difficile 
strains, B1 and 630, showed significant differences in the progression and 
severity of disease in this model. B1-infected hamsters exhibited more severe 
pathology and a shorter time to death than hamsters infected with 630. 
Histological changes in the gut did not correlate with absolute numbers of C. 
difficile bacteria, but there were clear differences in the distribution of 
bacteria within gut tissues. Light, scanning, and transmission electron 
microscopy revealed high numbers of B1 bacteria at the mucosal surface of the 
tissue, whereas 630 bacteria were more frequently associated with the crypt 
regions. Both B1 and 630 bacteria were frequently observed within 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, although, interestingly, a space frequently 
separated B1 bacteria from the phagosome wall, a phenomenon not observed with 
630. However, pilus-like structures were detected on 630 located in the crypts 
of the gut tissue. Furthermore, B1 bacteria, but not 630 bacteria, were found 
within nonphagocytic cells, including enterocytes and muscle cells.
