Toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) from Clostridium difficile are the causative 
agents of the C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and its severe form, the 
pseudomembranous colitis. TcdA and TcdB both glucosylate and thereby inactivate 
low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 
subfamilies. In cultured cell lines, TcdB induces actin re-organization and 
bi-nucleation ("cytopathic effects") and cell death ("cytotoxic effects"). In 
this study, the role of cell cycle progression in the cytopathic and the 
cytotoxic effects of TcdB is evaluated by a differential analysis of these 
effects in proliferating and non-proliferating cells. Density-synchronized 
murine fibroblasts and confluent HT29 colonocytes are exploited as cell culture 
models for non-proliferating cells. Cell death is analyzed in terms of a loss of 
cell viability, phosphatidylserine exposure, and DNA fragmentation. In 
proliferating cells, TcdB blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptotic cell 
death. In contrast, TcdB induces non-apoptotic cell death in non-proliferating 
cells. TcdB-induced cell rounding turns out to be independent of cell cycle 
progression. Cell cycle progression is an important determinant in the 
biological effects of TcdB. With respect to the pathology of CDAD, this study 
leads to the new hypothesis that necrotic cell death of terminally 
differentiated colonocytes and inhibition of epithelial renewal of the colon 
contribute to the pathogenesis of CDAD.
