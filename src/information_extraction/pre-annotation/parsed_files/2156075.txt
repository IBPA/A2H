Thirty isolates of Clostridium difficile expressing different degrees of 
toxigenicity and virulence in an animal model were assayed for the production of 
chondroitin-4-sulphatase, hyaluronidase, heparinase, collagenase and protease. 
All strains demonstrated some hydrolytic enzyme activity. There was no direct 
correlation between toxigenic status, or virulence, and hydrolytic enzyme 
production. However, all five strains known to be highly virulent in the hamster 
model had hyaluronidase, chondroitin-4-sulphatase and collagenase activity 
whereas only three of five toxigenic but poorly virulent strains had these 
activities, the collagenase activity being weak in all three cases. The only two 
proteolytic strains are also highly virulent. The potential tissue damaging 
properties of these hydrolytic enzymes may help to explain the differences in 
virulence of C. difficile strains seen in the Syrian hamster model of 
antibiotic-associated colitis, and may contribute to the spectrum of disease 
seen in man. It is also possible that chondroitin-4-sulphatase, hyaluronidase 
and collagenase activity may release essential nutrients, promoting 
establishment of C. difficile in the gut.
