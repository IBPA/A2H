Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea. C. 
difficile produces two toxins (A and B), and systemic and mucosal anti-toxin A 
antibodies prevent or limit C. difficile-associated diarrhea. To evaluate 
whether transcutaneous immunization with formalin-treated C. difficile toxin A 
(CDA) induces systemic and mucosal anti-CDA immune responses, we 
transcutaneously immunized three cohorts of mice with CDA with or without 
immunoadjuvantative cholera toxin (CT) on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Mice 
transcutaneously immunized with CDA and CT developed prominent anti-CDA and 
anti-CT immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses in serum and anti-CDA and 
anti-CT IgA responses in stool. Sera from immunized mice were able to neutralize 
C. difficile toxin A activity in an in vitro cell culture assay. CDA itself 
demonstrated adjuvant activity and enhanced both serum and stool anti-CT IgA 
responses. Our results suggest that transcutaneous immunization with CDA toxoid 
may be a feasible immunization strategy against C. difficile, an important cause 
of morbidity and mortality against which current preventative strategies are 
failing.
