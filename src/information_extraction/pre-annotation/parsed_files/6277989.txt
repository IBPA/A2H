A strain of Clostridium perfringens, type A, has been isolated from the 
intestine of a dog which died from parvovirus infection. This Clostridium strain 
produces a toxin which can be detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis, using C. 
difficile antitoxin, and produces cytotoxicity in WI-38 cell culture. 
Cytopathology can be blocked by C. difficile antitoxin. Its role in canine 
parvovirus infection is unknown.
