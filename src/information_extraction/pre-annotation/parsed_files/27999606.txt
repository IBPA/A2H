Traditional Chinese medicine QPYF has a good effect for treating 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to 
test its efficacy to prevent Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) in 
a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were infected with Clostridium difficile VPI 10463 
after exposure to antimicrobial mixture. QPYF was administered from 7 days prior 
to Clostridium difficile infection to 20 days after infection, and its effect 
was compared with no treatment and receiving placebo. The mice were monitored 
for 20 days and the percent survival, disease activity index, weight loss, colon 
histopathology, and the levels of toxins in the feces were measured. The 
expressions of TNF α, MCP-1, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in the colon were 
presented by immunohistochemistry. The survival rate of QPYF group (93.75%) was 
higher than that of model control group (65%). The mice treated with QPYF had a 
lower weight loss and disease activity index, compared to the mice with placebo. 
A significantly lower level of histopathology scores, toxins in the feces, and 
TNF α, MCP-1, NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 were detected for QPYF-treated 
mice. Traditional Chinese medicine QPYF showed a good preventive effect for CDAD 
in a mouse model.
