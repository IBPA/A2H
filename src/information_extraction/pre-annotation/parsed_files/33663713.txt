Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), a technique used to restore normal intestinal 
microbial communities, has been successful in treating humans with 
Clostridioides difficile colitis. Subsequently, FMT is being used in veterinary 
patients with suspected intestinal dysbiosis. Unfortunately, little data are 
available regarding best practices for FMT in horses. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the effects of storing manure prepared for equine FMT 
(MP-FMT) at -20°C for up to 4 weeks and passage through a simulated proximal 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract on the viability of MP-FMT. The results of this 
study indicate that storage at -20°C for greater than 1 week and exposure to 
conditions consistent with the proximal GI tract significantly decreased 
viability of the microbial population, with gram-negative enteric bacteria most 
significantly impacted. This preliminary evaluation indicates that further work 
is necessary to determine best practices to preserve the viability MP-FMT in 
horses.
