The objective of this work was to test the protective effect of a mixture (MM) 
constituted by kefir-isolated microorganisms (Lactobacillus plantarum, 
Lactobacillus kefir, Lc. lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) in a hamster model of infection with Clostridium difficile, an 
anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that causes diarrhoea. Placebo or MM was 
administered ad libitum in drinking water from day 0 to the end of treatment. 
Hamsters received orally 200 μg of clyndamicin at day 7 and then were infected 
with 1 × 10(8) CFU of C. difficile by gavage. Development of diarrhoea and death 
was registered until the end of the protocol. Surviving animals were sacrificed 
at day 16, and a test for biological activity of clostridial toxins and 
histological stainings were performed in caecum samples. Six of seven infected 
animals developed diarrhoea and 5/7 died at the end of the experimental 
protocol. The histological sections showed oedema and inflammatory infiltrates 
with neutrophils and crypt abscesses. In the group of animals infected and 
treated with MM1/1000, only 1 of 7 hamsters showed diarrhoea and none of them 
died. The histological sections showed only a slight thickening of the mucosa 
with presence of lymphocytic infiltrate. These results demonstrate that an oral 
treatment with a mixture of kefir-isolated bacteria and yeasts was able to 
prevent diarrhoea and enterocolitis triggered by C. difficile.
