Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of world-wide 
nosocomial acquired diarrhea in adults. Active vaccination is generally accepted 
as a logical and cost-effective approach to prevent CDI. In this paper, we have 
generated two novel chimeric proteins; one designated Tcd169, comprised of the 
glucosyltransferase domain (GT), the cysteine proteinase domain (CPD), and 
receptor binding domain (RBD) of TcdB, and the RBD of TcdA; the other designated 
Tcd169FI, which contains Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (sFliC) and Tcd169. 
Both proteins were expressed in and purified from Bacillus megaterium. Point 
mutations were made in the GT (W102A, D288N) and CPD (C698) of TcdB to ensure 
that Tcd169 and Tcd169FI were atoxic. Immunization with Tcd169 or Tcd169Fl 
induced protective immunity against TcdA/TcdB challenge through intraperitoneal 
injection, also provided mice full protection against infection with a 
hyper-virulent C. difficile strain (BI/NAP1/027). In addition, inclusion of 
sFlic in the fusion protein (Tcd169Fl) enhanced its protective immunity against 
toxin challenge, reduced C. difficile numbers in feces from Tcd169Fl-immunized 
mice infected C. difficile. Our data show that Tcd169 and Tcd169FI fusion 
proteins may represent alternative vaccine candidates against CDI.
