Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other 
flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model 
in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of 
Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 
Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the 
other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only 
in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed 
in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when 
co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
