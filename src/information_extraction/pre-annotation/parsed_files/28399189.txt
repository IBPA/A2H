The technology of display of heterologous proteins on the surface of Bacillus 
subtilis spores enables use of these structures as carriers of antigens for 
mucosal vaccination. Currently, there are no technical possibilities to predict 
whether a designed fusion will be efficiently displayed on the spore surface and 
how such recombinant spores will interact with cells of the immune system. In 
this study, we compared four variants of B. subtilis spores presenting a 
fragment of a FliD protein from Clostridium difficile in fusion with CotB, CotC, 
CotG or CotZ spore coat proteins. We show that these spores promote their own 
phagocytosis and activate both, the J774 macrophages and JAWSII dendritic cells 
of murine cell lines. Moreover, we used these spores for mucosal immunization of 
mice. We conclude that the observed effects vary with the type of displayed 
FliD-spore coat protein fusion and seem to be mostly independent of its 
abundance and localization in the spore coat structure.
