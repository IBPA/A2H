Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis in healthcare settings. However, the host factors 
involved in the intestinal inflammatory response and pathogenesis of 
C. difficile infection (CDI) are largely unknown. Here we investigated the role 
of leukotrienes (LTs), a group of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, in CDI. 
Notably, the neutrophil chemoattractant LTB4, but not cysteinyl (cys) LTs, was 
induced in the intestine of C57BL/6 mice infected with either C. difficile 
strain VPI 10463 or strain 630. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of LT 
production did not ameliorate C. difficile colitis or clinical signs of disease 
in infected mice. Histological analysis demonstrated that intestinal 
neutrophilic inflammation, edema and tissue damage in mice during acute and 
severe CDI were not modulated in the absence of LTs. In addition, CDI induced a 
burst of cytokines in the intestine of infected mice in a LT-independent manner. 
Serum levels of anti-toxin A immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were also not 
modulated by endogenous LTs. Collectively, our results do not support a role for 
LTs in modulating host susceptibility to CDI in mice.
