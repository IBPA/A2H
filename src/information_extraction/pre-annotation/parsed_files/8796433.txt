'Blown pack' spoilage of vacuum-packed chilled beef, lamb and venison, and of a 
cooked meat product, chilled dog rolls packed in an oxygen-impermeable plastic 
casing, was characterised by sensory, chemical and microbiological analysis. 
Investigation of the probable causative agents led to the isolation of eight 
strains of psychrotrophic clostridia. Three strains have been provisionally 
identified as C. difficile, C. beijerinckii and C. lituseburense; the other five 
remain unidentified. In inoculation studies only one isolate produced 
significant amount of gas on meat, causing pack 'blowing'. It is, therefore, 
possible that 'blown pack' spoilage involves a synergism with one or more other 
organisms.
