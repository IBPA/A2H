Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is a key factor predisposing intestinal infection 
by Clostridium difficile. Here, we show that interventions that restore butyrate 
intestinal levels mitigate clinical and pathological features of 
C. difficile-induced colitis. Butyrate has no effect on C. difficile 
colonization or toxin production. However, it attenuates intestinal inflammation 
and improves intestinal barrier function in infected mice, as shown by reduced 
intestinal epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation, effects 
associated with the increased expression of components of intestinal epithelial 
cell tight junctions. Activation of the transcription factor HIF-1 in intestinal 
epithelial cells exerts a protective effect in C. difficile-induced colitis, and 
it is required for butyrate effects. We conclude that butyrate protects 
intestinal epithelial cells from damage caused by C. difficile toxins via 
the stabilization of HIF-1, mitigating local inflammatory response and systemic 
consequences of the infection.
