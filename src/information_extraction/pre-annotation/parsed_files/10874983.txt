It has recently been shown that the cell line Don Q obtained by mutagenesis of 
wild type Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Don wt), presents a point mutation 
in the gene coding for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. The persistent low level 
of UDP-glucose makes Don Q clone resistant to Clostridium difficile toxin B. 
Starting from the observation that Don Q cells exhibit many large hydrophobic 
cytoplasmic inclusions, that we have found to be made of neutral lipids, the 
aerobic metabolism of the two cell lines has been examined. The specific 
activity of cytochrome oxidase in Don Q cells is more than 5 times lower than 
that found in Don wt. Also, the activity of Complexes II + III, expressed by the 
activity of succinate-cytochrome c oxido-reductase, has been found to be lower 
in Don Q compared to wt cells. On the other hand, NADH-cytochrome c 
oxido-reductase activity, insensitive to rotenone, is more than doubled in Don 
Q. In these cells the activity of lactate dehydrogenase is very high, being able 
to oxidise more than 3,000 nmoles of NADH/min/mg of protein. The results 
obtained indicate that Don Q cells, in addition to a decreased ability to 
synthesise UDP-glucose, have an impairment in the respiratory chain. Such an 
impairment could be correlated to the increased capacity to generate a higher 
amount of reducing equivalents through the glycolytic activity, which can then 
be utilised for the synthesis of fatty acids stored in lipid droplets.
