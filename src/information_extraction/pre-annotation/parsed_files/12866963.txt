BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficile is recognized as a frequent cause 
of antibiotic-induced diarrhea. This study was designed to investigate whether 
Clostridium difficile toxin A might induce apoptosis on human hepatoma cell line 
SMMC7721 and African green monkey kidney Vero cells.
METHODS: Highly purified toxin A was obtained by bovine thyroglobulin affinity 
purification followed by ion exchange chromatography on Q sepharose. The 
apoptosis induction of toxin A was examined on SMMC7721 cells with Vero cells as 
a control. Inhibition of proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Morphological 
assessment of apoptosis was performed with fluorescence and electronic 
microscopy. DNA fragmentation was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell 
cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Toxin A (0.293-4.690 mg x L(-1) ) inhibited proliferation of SMMC7721 
and Vero cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Morphological 
changes of typical apoptosis showed that SMMC7721 had a higher percentage of 
apoptosis than Vero cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from SMMC7721 
treated with toxin A for 48 hours revealed a "ladder" pattern.
CONCLUSION: Clostridium difficile toxin A induced apoptosis of SMMC7721 and Vero 
cells. The apoptosis induction on SMMC7721 cells was more effective than that on 
Vero cells.
