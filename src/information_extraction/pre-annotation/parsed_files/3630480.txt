The biological activity of the filtrates of 29 C. difficile strains was studied 
in vivo (suckling white mice) and in vitro (cell cultures of different species 
and origin). The action of the filtrates on the experimental models in vivo was 
evaluated from the cytotoxic effect index, while in vitro the intensity of the 
cytotoxic effect was evaluated from the percentage of dead cells in the 
monolayer. The results of the comparative determination of toxicity 
characteristics in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that cell cultures were more 
sensitive experimental models than suckling white mice. The use of cell cultures 
permitted the quantitative evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of the filtrates 
under study, as well as the detection of their cell-directed action at minimal 
concentrations.
