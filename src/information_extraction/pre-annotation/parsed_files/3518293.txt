A clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile has been tested for its toxin 
production. Both toxins, toxin A and toxin B, could be detected by tissue 
culture and in animal models as well. Antibodies against a crude toxin A 
preparation have been prepared. These antibodies are able to neutralize the 
toxin both in the mouse lethality test and tissue culture test systems. The 
specificity of this antiserum has been analysed by electroimmunoprecipitation 
methods. Using immunoblotting, it could be demonstrated that the antigenicity of 
toxin A after SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and 
reducing conditions was still preserved. The molecular weight of toxin A has 
been estimated to be 250000. Immunoblotting offers a simple and reliable 
procedure for toxin A detection from culture supernatants of C. difficile.
