Clostridium difficile is a prominent nosocomial pathogen, proliferating and 
causing enteric disease in individuals with a compromised gut microflora. We 
characterized the post-translational modification of flagellin in C. difficile 
630. The structure of the modification was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance 
and shown to contain an N-acetylglucosamine substituted with a phosphorylated 
N-methyl-l-threonine. A reverse genetics approach investigated the function of 
the putative four-gene modification locus. All mutants were found to have 
truncated glycan structures by LC-MS/MS, taking into account bioinformatic 
analysis, we propose that the open reading frame CD0241 encodes a kinase 
involved in the transfer of the phosphate to the threonine, the CD0242 protein 
catalyses the addition of the phosphothreonine to the N-acetylglucosamine moiety 
and CD0243 transfers the methyl group to the threonine. Some mutations affected 
motility and caused cells to aggregate to each other and abiotic surfaces. 
Altering the structure of the flagellin modification impacted on colonization 
and disease recurrence in a murine model of infection, showing that alterations 
in the surface architecture of C. difficile vegetative cells can play a 
significant role in disease. We show that motility is not a requirement for 
colonization, but that colonization was compromised when the glycan structure 
was incomplete.
