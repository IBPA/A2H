In diseased piglets from two Dutch pig-breeding farms with neonatal diarrhoea 
for more than a year, culture and PCR analyses identified the involved 
microorganism as Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 078 harbouring toxin A 
(tcdA) and B (tcdB), and binary toxin genes. Isolated strains showed a 39 bp 
deletion in the tcdC gene and they were ermB gene-negative. A number of 11 
porcine and 21 human isolated C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 toxinotype V strains 
were found genetically related by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat 
analysis (MLVA). Moreover, a clonal complex was identified, containing both 
porcine and human isolates. The porcine isolates showed an antimicrobial 
susceptibility profile overlapping that of isolates from Dutch human patients. 
On the basis of these pheno- and genotypical analyses results, it was concluded 
that the strains from affected piglets were indistinguishable from increasingly 
encountered C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 strains of human C. difficile 
infections in the Dutch population and that a common origin of animal and humans 
strains should be considered.
