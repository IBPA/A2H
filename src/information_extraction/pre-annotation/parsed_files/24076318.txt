Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 
healthcare facilities worldwide. C. difficile infections are difficult to treat 
because of the high rate of disease recurrence after antibiotic therapy, leaving 
few treatment options for patients. C. difficile is also difficult to contain 
within a healthcare setting due to a highly-transmissible, resistant spore form 
that challenges standard infection control measures. The recent development of 
murine infection models to study the interactions between C. difficile, the host 
and the microbiota are providing novel insight into the mechanisms of 
pathogenesis and transmission that should guide the development of therapies and 
intervention measures.
