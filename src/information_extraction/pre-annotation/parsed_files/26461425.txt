Clostridium difficile CD37, a clinical isolate from the USA, does not produce 
toxin A, B or binary toxin. The aim of this study was to determine whether 
strain CD37 can protect mice against infection from a challenge with a toxigenic 
C. difficile strain. Three groups of mice (n = 10) were pretreated with a 
antibiotics cocktail for 5 days, switched to sterile water for 2 days, and given 
one dose of clindamycin (10 mg/kg) one day (day-1) before challenge (day 0) with 
a toxigenic C. difficile strain. Group 1 (CD37 + UK6) was given 10(7)C. 
difficile CD37 vegetative cells by gavage twice a day on days -1 and -2, 
followed by challenge with 10(6) spores of the toxigenic C. difficile UK6 
(BI/NAPI/027) on day 0; Group 2 (UK6) was infected with 10(6)C. difficile UK6 
spores on day 0; Group 3 (CD37) was challenged with 10(6) CD37 vegetative cells 
on day 0. Our data show that pre-inoculation of strain CD37 provided mice 
significant protection (survival, p < 0.001 between groups CD37 + UK6 and UK6) 
against subsequent infection with the strain UK6, while mice infected with CD37 
only did not develop any symptoms of C. difficile infection (CDI). Our results 
highlight the potential use of CD37 as a therapeutic strain for the prevention 
of primary and recurrent CDI in humans.
