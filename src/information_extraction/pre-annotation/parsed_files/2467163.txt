Two Cl. difficile toxins were isolated from cultures of Cl. difficile strain VPI 
10463. A purification procedure to prepare homogenous Cl. difficile toxins is 
given. This procedure allows purification of high molecular weight toxins A and 
B without using immunaffinity chromatography. The main step of the purification 
is the separation of a partially purified toxin preparation over a FPLC-Mono Q 
column by anion exchange chromatography. The experimental conditions for a 
rechromatography were determined to prepare the two major toxic activities as 
homogenous high molecular weight proteins. Our toxin A has a molecular weight 
(Mr) of ca. 300 kDa and an IP of 4.7. The Mr of our toxin B is ca. 250 kDa, the 
isoelectric focusing gives rise to two bands one at 4.7 and the other at 4.8. 
The two bands represent charge isomers as have been described for other 
bacterial toxins. Both toxins differ in cytotoxicity testing by a factor of 1000 
but have the same activity when tested in vivo. Toxin specific monoclonal 
antibodies (mabs) were elicited by separate immunization of mice either with 
toxin A or toxin B, respectively. All of our mabs cross react with pure toxin A 
and toxin B when tested by ELISA or Western Blotting. Some mabs strongly cross 
react indicating that both toxins have major epitopes in common. A hypothesis 
for the structural and possible functional relatedness between the two toxins is 
discussed.
