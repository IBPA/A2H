Sperm-egg interaction was investigated in mouse eggs freed from the zona 
pellucida and injected with Clostridium difficile toxin B, the inhibitor of Rho 
family small G proteins. Toxin B reduced in a dose-dependent manner the 
percentage of eggs associated with sperm fusion on the surface or sperm nucleus 
decondensation in the ooplasm, examined by injection of a DNA-staining dye into 
the egg and transfer of the dye to the fused sperm head after recording 
intracellular Ca(2+) responses for 100 min postinsemination. The mean number of 
decondensed sperm nuclei per egg was remarkably decreased by approximately 1 
microg/ml toxin B in the ooplasm. This was because spermatozoa were arrested at 
the fusion state without developing to sperm incorporation and tended to lose 
cytoplasmic continuity to the egg. The fusion-arrested spermatozoa caused 
transient small Ca(2+) oscillations in most of eggs, while an injected 
spermatozoon produced repetitive large Ca(2+) spikes unaffected by toxin B. A 
decrease in the rate of fused spermatozoa and decondensed sperm nuclei was also 
caused by 20-40 microM cytochalasin D, the inhibitor of actin polymerization. 
Immunostaining of Rho proteins showed that Rac1 and RhoB are present in the 
cortical ooplasm, but Cdc42 is absent. Actin filaments in the cortex appeared to 
be reduced in toxin B-injected eggs. This study suggests that Rho protein(s) 
regulating actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization is involved in the process 
leading to sperm incorporation.
