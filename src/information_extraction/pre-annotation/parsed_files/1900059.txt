The pathogenicity of Clostridium difficile is due to the production of two 
toxins (toxins A and B). We prepared monoclonal antibodies against toxin A and 
determined whether axenic mice passively immunized with the monoclonal 
antibodies were protected against C. difficile disease. The mice were kept in an 
isolator and were given ascites fluid intravenously prior to challenge with a 
toxinogenic strain of C. difficile. Control mice and mice receiving ascites 
fluid devoid of toxin antibody died within 2 days and had high levels of toxins 
A and B in their feces. Mice that received ascites fluid containing high amounts 
of toxin A monoclonal antibodies directed against the repeating units of the 
toxin survived. In protected mice, toxin B levels were similar to those in dying 
mice, but toxin A levels were greatly reduced. These data show that passive 
immunity induced by monoclonal antibodies against toxin A was effective against 
pseudomembranous cecitis.
