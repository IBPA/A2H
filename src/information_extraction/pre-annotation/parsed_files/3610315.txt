When axenic mice fed a commercial diet were monoassociated with two toxigenic 
strains of Clostridium difficile, 100% of them died 3 days after inoculation and 
both enterotoxin and cytotoxin were produced in their intestinal tract. However, 
when axenic mice were fed various semisynthetic diets before C. difficile 
challenge, some of them survived and their fecal cytotoxin and enterotoxin 
productions were highly reduced, whereas the C. difficile population level did 
not decrease to a great extent. Thus, gnotobiotic mice associated with C. 
difficile were a good model for the study of modulation by the dietary regimen 
of intestinal cytotoxin and enterotoxin production.
