Clostridium difficile is the most common hospital acquired pathogen in the USA, 
and infection is, in many cases, fatal. Toxins A and B are its major virulence 
factors, but expression of a third toxin, known as C. difficile transferase 
(CDT), is increasingly common. An adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase 
that causes actin cytoskeletal disruption, CDT is typically produced by the 
major, hypervirulent strains and has been associated with more severe disease. 
Here, we show that CDT enhances the virulence of two PCR-ribotype 027 strains in 
mice. The toxin induces pathogenic host inflammation via a Toll-like receptor 2 
(TLR2)-dependent pathway, resulting in the suppression of a protective host 
eosinophilic response. Finally, we show that restoration of TLR2-deficient 
eosinophils is sufficient for protection from a strain producing CDT. These 
findings offer an explanation for the enhanced virulence of CDT-expressing C. 
difficile and demonstrate a mechanism by which this binary toxin subverts the 
host immune response.
