Clostridioides difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a key virulence factor that causes C. 
difficile associated diseases (CDAD) including diarrhea and pseudomembranous 
colitis. TcdB can be divided into multiple subtypes/variants based on their 
sequence variations, of which four (TcdB1-4) are dominant types found in major 
epidemic isolates. Here, we find that these variants are highly diverse in their 
receptor preference: TcdB1 uses two known receptors CSPG4 and Frizzled (FZD) 
proteins, TcdB2 selectively uses CSPG4, TcdB3 prefers to use FZDs, whereas TcdB4 
uses neither CSPG4 nor FZDs. By creating chimeric toxins and systematically 
switching residues between TcdB1 and TcdB3, we determine that regions in the 
N-terminal cysteine protease domain (CPD) are involved in CSPG4-recognition. We 
further evaluate the pathological effects induced by TcdB1-4 with a mouse 
intrarectal installation model. TcdB1 leads to the most severe overall symptoms, 
followed by TcdB2 and TcdB3. When comparing the TcdB2 and TcdB3, TcdB2 causes 
stronger oedema while TcdB3 induces severer inflammatory cell infiltration. 
These findings together demonstrate divergence in the receptor preference and 
further lead to colonic pathology for predominant TcdB subtypes.
