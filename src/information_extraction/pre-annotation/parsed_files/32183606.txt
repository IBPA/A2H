Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common cause of nosocomial 
diarrhea and can sometimes lead to pseudo-membranous colitis and toxic 
megacolon. We previously reported that the PCR ribotype 002 was a common C. 
difficile ribotype in Hong Kong that was associated with increased mortality. In 
this study, we assessed in vitro bacteriological characteristics and in vivo 
virulence of ribotype 002 compared to other common ribotypes, including 
ribotypes 012, 014 and 046. We observed significantly higher toxin A (p < 0.05) 
and toxin B (p < 0.05) production, sporulation (p < 0.001) and germination rates 
(p < 0.0001) in ribotype 002 than other common ribotypes. In a murine model of 
C. difficile infection, ribotype 002 caused significantly more weight loss 
(p < 0.001) and histological damage (p < 0.001) than other common ribotypes. 
These findings may have contributed to the higher prevalence and mortality 
observed, and provided mechanistic insights that can help public surveillance 
and develop novel therapeutics to combat against this infection.
