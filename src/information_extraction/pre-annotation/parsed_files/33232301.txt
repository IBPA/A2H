Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of health care-associated diarrhea. 
Severity ranges from mild to life-threatening, but this variability remains 
poorly understood. Microbiologic diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI) is 
straightforward but offers little insight into the patient's prognosis or into 
pathophysiologic determinants of clinical trajectory. The aim of this study was 
to discover host-derived, CDI-specific fecal biomarkers involved in disease 
severity. Subjects without and with CDI diarrhea were recruited. CDI severity 
was based on Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare 
Epidemiology of America criteria. We developed a liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry approach to identify host-derived protein biomarkers from 
stool and applied it to diagnostic samples for cohort-wise comparison 
(CDI-negative vs. nonsevere CDI vs. severe CDI). Selected biomarkers were 
orthogonally confirmed and subsequently verified in a CDI mouse model. We 
identified a protein signature from stool, consisting of alpha-2-macroglobulin 
(A2MG), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), that 
not only discriminates CDI-positive samples from non-CDI ones but also is 
potentially associated with disease severity. In the mouse model, this signature 
with the murine homologs of the corresponding proteins was also identified. 
A2MG, MMP-7, and A1AT serve as biomarkers in patients with CDI and define novel 
components of the host response that may determine disease severity.
