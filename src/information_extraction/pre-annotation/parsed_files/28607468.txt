Clostridium difficile is the most important enteropathogen involved in gut 
nosocomial post-antibiotic infections. The emergence of hypervirulent strains 
has contributed to increased mortality and morbidity of CDI. The C. difficile 
toxins contribute directly to CDI-associated lesions of the gut, but other 
bacterial factors are needed for the bacteria to adhere and colonize the 
intestinal epithelium. The C. difficile flagella, which confer motility and 
chemotaxis for successful intestinal colonization, could play an additional role 
in bacterial pathogenesis by contributing to the inflammatory response of the 
host and mucosal injury. Indeed, by activating the TLR5, flagella can elicit 
activation of the MAPK and NF-ÎºB cascades of cell signaling, leading to the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate, 
by using an animal model of CDI, a synergic effect of flagella and toxins in 
eliciting an inflammatory mucosal response. In this model, the absence of 
flagella dramatically decreases the degree of mucosal inflammation in mice and 
the sole presence of toxins without flagella was not enough to elicit epithelial 
lesions. These results highlight the important role of C. difficile flagella in 
eliciting mucosal lesions as long as the toxins exert their action on the 
epithelium.
