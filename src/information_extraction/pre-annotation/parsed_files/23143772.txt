A DNA vaccination approach was used in the current study to screen for the 
immunogenicity of different fragments of toxin A and toxin B from Clostridium 
difficile. With this approach, protein antigens do not need to be produced in 
vitro and the immunogenicity of candidate C. difficile antigens can be 
identified directly in animals. Codon optimized toxin gene fragments were 
individually cloned into the DNA vaccine vector and tested in mice and rabbits 
for their ability to elicit C. difficile toxin-specific antibody responses. Only 
a subset of the C. difficile toxin fragments, including the C-terminal receptor 
binding domain of toxin A and a novel N-terminal enzymatic domain of toxin B, 
were able to elicit protective antibody responses as determined by protection of 
target cells in a cytotoxicity assay or by preventing death of mice in a passive 
antibody protection study. Significantly, antibodies elicited by the novel 
N-terminus of the toxin B DNA vaccine were able to increase the level of 
protection when used in combination with anti-toxin A antibodies in a toxin 
challenge model in mice.
