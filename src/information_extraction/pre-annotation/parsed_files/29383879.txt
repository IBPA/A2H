Toxin B (TcdB) is a major pathogenic factor of Clostridum difficile. However, 
the mechanism by which TcdB exerts its cytotoxic action in host cells is still 
not completely known. Herein, we report for the first time that TcdB induced 
autophagic cell death in cultured human colonocytes. The induction of autophagy 
was demonstrated by the increased levels of LC3-II, formation of LC3+ 
autophagosomes, accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles and reduced levels 
of the autophagic substrate p62/SQSTM1. TcdB-induced autophagy was also 
accompanied by the repression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 activity. 
Functionally, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or 
chloroquine or knockdown of autophagy-related genes Beclin 1, Atg5 and Atg7 
attenuated TcdB-induced cell death in colonocytes. Genetic ablation of Atg5, a 
gene required for autophagosome formation, also mitigated the cytotoxic effect 
of TcdB. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that autophagy serves as a 
pro-death mechanism mediating the cytotoxic action of TcdB in colonocytes. This 
discovery suggested that blockade of autophagy might be a novel therapeutic 
strategy for C. difficile infection.
