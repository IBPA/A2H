Stools from a patient with antibiotic-associated colitis and cecal contents from 
a hamster with clindamycin-induced enterocolitis were compared in a cytotoxicity 
assay to determine common properties. Both specimens produced actinomorphic 
changes in human amnion cells at 10(-7) dilutions. The toxin was acid labile, 
heat labile, nonether extractable, non-dialyzable, and produced maximum activity 
at 60% with ammonium sulfate precipitation. Cytotoxicity was neutralized with 
clostridial antitoxin but not with equine serum. Clostridium difficile was 
recovered in high concentrations in specimens from both the hamster and 
patients. The supernatants of these C. difficile strains produced cytoxic 
effects which were also neutralized by clostridial antitoxins. These results 
indicate that clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters is a model of human 
disease and implicate toxin-producing clostridia as responsible agents.
