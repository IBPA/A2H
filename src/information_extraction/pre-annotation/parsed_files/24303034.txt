Clostridium difficile is a pathogen which is responsible for diarrhea and 
colitis, particularly after treatment with antibiotics. Clinical signs are 
mainly due to two toxins, TcdA and TcdB. However, the first step of pathogenesis 
is the colonization process. We evaluated C. difficile surface proteins as 
vaccine antigens in the hamster model to prevent intestinal colonization. This 
vaccination induced a partial protection of hamsters against death after a C. 
difficile challenge. A proteomic analysis of animal sera allowed us to identify 
proteins which could be responsible for the protection observed. Among these 
proteins, we identified the GroEL heat shock protein. To confirm the role of the 
specific GroEL antibodies in the delayed C. difficile colonization of hamsters, 
we performed an immunization assay in a mouse model. After intranasal 
immunization with the recombinant protein GroEL, we observed a lower C. 
difficile intestinal colonization in the immunized group as compared to the 
control group.
