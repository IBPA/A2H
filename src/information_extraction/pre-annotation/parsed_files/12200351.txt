Dendritic cells (DCs) possess numerous dendrites that may be of great advantage 
to interaction with T cells. However, it has been poorly understood how the 
dendritic morphology of a DC is controlled. In the present study, using a murine 
spleen-derived DC line, we analyzed effects of CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, on 
dendritic morphology. Mature DCs, but not immature DCs, showed vigorous 
migration to either CCL19 or CCL21. CCL19 also rapidly (within 30 minutes) 
induced marked extension of dendrites of mature DCs that was maintained at least 
for 24 hours. On the other hand, CCL21 failed to induce rapid dendritic 
extension, even though a modest dendritic extension of mature DCs, compared to 
that by CCL19, was induced 8 or 24 hours after treatment with CCL21. In 
addition, pretreatment with a high concentration of CCL21 significantly 
inhibited the rapid dendritic extension induced by CCL19. Thus, it is suggested 
that CCL19 and CCL21 exert agonistic and antagonistic influences on the 
initiation of dendritic extension of mature DCs. The CCL19-induced morphologic 
changes were completely blocked by Clostridium difficile toxin B that inhibits 
Rho guanosine triphosphatase proteins such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, but not by 
Y-27632, a specific inhibitor for Rho-associated kinase. These findings suggest 
that Rac or Cdc42 (or both), but not Rho, are involved in the CCL19-induced 
dendritic extension of mature DCs.
