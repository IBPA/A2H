This study investigated the use of a newly developed chitosan-Ca pectinate 
microbead formulation for the colon-targeted delivery of anti-A/B toxin 
immunoglobulin of egg yolk (IgY) to inhibit toxin binding to colon mucosa cells. 
The effect of the three components (pectinate, calcium chloride, and chitosan) 
used for the microbead production was examined with the aim of identifying the 
optimal levels to improve drug encapsulation efficiency, swelling ratio, and 
cumulative IgY release rate. The optimized IgY-loaded bead component was pectin 
5% (w/v), CaCl2 3% (w/v), and chitosan 0.5% (w/v). Formulated beads were 
spherical with 1.2-mm diameter, and the drug loading was 45%. An in vitro 
release study revealed that chitosan-Ca pectinate microbeads inhibited IgY 
release in the upper gastrointestinal tract and significantly improved the 
site-specific release of IgY in the colon. An in vivo rat study demonstrated 
that 72.6% of biologically active IgY was released specifically in the colon. 
These results demonstrated that anti-A/B toxin IgY-loaded chitosan-Ca pectinate 
oral microbeads improved IgY release behavior in vivo, which could be used as an 
effective oral delivery platform for the biological treatment of Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI).
