Following oral administration of lincomycin, over 50% of two groups of 12 
rabbits each died between 4 and 56 days with distended, non-hemorrhagic, 
fluid-filled ceca. Bacteria-free cecal filtrates from the rabbits that died were 
lethal for mice, cytopathic in Y-1 tissue culture monolayers, and caused 
increased vascular permeability in rabbit skin. Although the cecal filtrates of 
both groups had similar biological activity, the filtrate activity of one group 
was neutralized by Clostridium perfringens iota antitoxin, and the infiltrate 
activity of the other group was neutralized by Clostridium difficile antitoxin. 
Toxigenic Clostridium difficile also were isolated from the ceca of this group. 
A broth filtrate of a Clostridium difficile culture was lethal for rabbits when 
injected intravenously and intraperitoneally. The data indicated Clostridium 
difficile toxin or clostridium perfringens iota toxin may be associated with 
lincomycin-associated colitis in rabbits.
