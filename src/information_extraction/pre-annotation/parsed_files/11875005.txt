BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of the CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1 in acute 
enteritis was investigated by subjecting CCR1 knockout mice to Clostridium 
difficile toxin A treatment.
METHODS: Toxin A or vehicle was injected into ileal loops in anesthetized 
wild-type, CCR1-/- and macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1alpha-/- mice. After 
1-4 hours, fluid accumulation was calculated, and the loops were processed for 
histology, myeloperoxidase activity, regulated on activation, normal T cell 
expressed and secreted (RANTES) production, and messenger RNA measurements.
RESULTS: Toxin A induced in all mice a significant (P < 0.05) increase in ileal 
fluid accumulation, epithelial damage, and neutrophil infiltration, with all 
parameters being significantly (P < 0.01) lower in CCR1-/- and MIP-1alpha-/- 
mice. Ileal messenger RNA expression of the CCR1 ligands MIP-1alpha and RANTES 
and RANTES synthesis were increased in toxin A-treated wild-type mice. The 
RANTES antagonist Met-RANTES significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the toxin 
A-induced increases in ileal fluid accumulation and myeloperoxidase activity in 
wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: C. difficile toxin A-induced murine enteritis involves CCR1 and its 
ligands MIP-1alpha and RANTES, which may be important mediators of the 
neutrophil recruitment characterizing acute, enterotoxin-mediated enteritis.
