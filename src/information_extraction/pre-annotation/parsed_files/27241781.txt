Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium that causes diarrheal illnesses. 
Disease onset is linked with exposure to oral antibiotics and consequent 
depletion of secondary bile acids. Here we investigate the relationship between 
in vitro secondary bile acid tolerance and in vivo disease scores of diverse C. 
difficile strains in mice.
