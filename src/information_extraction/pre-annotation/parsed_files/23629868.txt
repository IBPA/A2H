The Clostridium difficile toxins A and B are primarily responsible for symptoms 
of C. difficile associated disease and are prime targets for vaccine 
development. We describe a plasmid-based system for the production of 
genetically modified toxins in a non-sporulating strain of C. difficile that 
lacks the toxin genes tcdA and tcdB. TcdA and TcdB mutations targeting 
established glucosyltransferase cytotoxicity determinants were introduced into 
recombinant plasmids and episomally expressed toxin mutants purified from C. 
difficile transformants. TcdA and TcdB mutants lacking glucosyltransferase and 
autoproteolytic processing activities were ~10â€Š000-fold less toxic to cultured 
human IMR-90 cells than corresponding recombinant or native toxins. However, 
both mutants retained residual cytotoxicity that could be prevented by 
preincubating the antigens with specific antibodies or by formalin treatment. 
Such non-toxic formalin-treated mutant antigens were immunogenic and protective 
in a hamster model of infection. The remaining toxicity of untreated TcdA and 
TcdB mutant antigens was associated with cellular swelling, a phenotype 
consistent with pore-induced membrane leakage. TcdB substitution mutations 
previously shown to block vesicular pore formation and toxin translocation 
substantially reduced residual toxicity. We discuss the implications of these 
results for the development of a C. difficile toxoid vaccine.
