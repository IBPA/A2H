Infections with Clostridium difficile increasingly cause morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. Bacterial surface glycans including lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were 
identified as auspicious vaccine antigens to prevent colonization. Here, we 
report on the potential of synthetic LTA glycans as vaccine candidates. We 
identified LTA-specific antibodies in the blood of C. difficile patients. 
Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a semi-synthetic LTA-CRM197 
glycoconjugate. The conjugate elicited LTA-specific antibodies in mice that 
recognized natural LTA epitopes on the surface of C. difficile bacteria 
and inhibited intestinal colonization of C. difficile in mice in vivo. Our 
findings underscore the promise of synthetic LTA glycans as C. difficile vaccine 
candidates.
