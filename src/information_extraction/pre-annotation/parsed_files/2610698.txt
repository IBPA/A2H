Toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin) of Clostridium difficile were both 
inactivated by the arginine specific reagent 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Molecular 
stability during the inactivation process was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis 
showing the same migration rates for modified and unmodified forms of the 230 
kDa toxin A and of the 250 kDa toxin B. Cytotoxicity of both toxins as well as 
mouse lethality of the enterotoxin were drastically decreased as a result of the 
arginine modification. The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. 
Analysis of the data suggested that modification of a single arginine residue 
was sufficient to abolish the activity of both toxins.
