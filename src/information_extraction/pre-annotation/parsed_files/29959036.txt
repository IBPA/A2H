Although standard antibiotic therapy is performed for diarrhea and 
pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, a high recurrence rate 
of C. difficile infection (CDI) remains a major problem. We previously showed 
that a membrane fraction of nontoxigenic C. difficile (ntCDMF) was effective as 
a vaccine antigen by in vitro experiments. In this study, we examined whether 
ntCDMF had an in vivo effect in animal challenge experiments. By intrarectal 
immunization with ntCDMF, the number of C. difficile cells in feces of mice was 
decreased approximately 99% compared to the control mice. In addition, survival 
rate of C. difficile-challenged hamsters was increased almost 30% by 
immunization with ntCDMF. These results showed that ntCDMF could be a practical 
vaccine candidate.
