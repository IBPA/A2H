The ability of Saccharomyces boulardii to protect mice against intestinal 
pathology caused by toxinogenic Clostridium difficile was studied. Different 
regions of the intestine of experimental mice were prepared for observation by 
scanning electron microscopy or homogenized for C. difficile enumeration and 
quantification of toxin A by enzyme immunoassay and toxin B by cytotoxicity. The 
test group was treated for 6 d with an S. boulardii suspension in drinking water 
and challenged with C. difficule on day 4. The three control groups were: axenic 
mice, mice treated with only S. boulardii and mice only challenged with C. 
difficile. The results showed that: (i) 70% of the mice infected by C. difficile 
survived when treated with S. boulardii; (ii) the C. difficile-induced lesions 
on the small and large intestinal mucosa were absent or markedly less severe in 
S. boulardii-treated mice; and (iii) there was no decrease in the number of C. 
difficile but rather a reduction in the amount of toxins A and B in S. 
boulardii-treated mice.
