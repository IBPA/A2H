Diarrhea and pseudomembrane colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection is 
a global health concern because of the high recurrence rate after standard 
antibiotic therapy. Vaccination presents a powerful countermeasure against 
disease recurrence. In this study, mice vaccinated with the nontoxigenic 
C. difficile membrane fraction generated a marked immune response to the 
antigen, as demonstrated by the serum IgG and intestinal fluid IgA levels. 
Significantly, pretreatment with harvested IgG- and IgA-containing fluids was 
sufficient to prevent in vitro adhesion of C. difficile to human Caco-2 
intestinal cells. These results highlight the potential of nontoxigenic 
C. difficile membrane fraction as a vaccine candidate for C. difficile 
infection.
