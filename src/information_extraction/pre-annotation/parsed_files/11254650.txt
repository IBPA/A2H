Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast that protects against 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis. The 
administration of C. difficile toxoid A by gavage to S. boulardii-fed BALB/c 
mice caused a 1.8-fold increase in total small intestinal immunoglobulin A 
levels (P = 0.003) and a 4.4-fold increase in specific intestinal anti-toxin A 
levels (P < 0.001). Enhancing host intestinal immune responses may be an 
important mechanism for S. boulardii-mediated protection against diarrheal 
illnesses.
