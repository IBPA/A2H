The involvement of host immunity in the gut microbiota-mediated colonization 
resistance to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is incompletely 
understood. Here, we show that interleukin (IL)-22, induced by colonization of 
the gut microbiota, is crucial for the prevention of CDI in human 
microbiota-associated (HMA) mice. IL-22 signaling in HMA mice regulated host 
glycosylation, which enabled the growth of succinate-consuming bacteria 
Phascolarctobacterium spp. within the gut microbiome. Phascolarctobacterium 
reduced the availability of luminal succinate, a crucial metabolite for the 
growth of C. difficile, and therefore prevented the growth of C. difficile. 
IL-22-mediated host N-glycosylation is likely impaired in patients with 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and renders UC-HMA mice more susceptible to CDI. 
Transplantation of healthy human-derived microbiota or Phascolarctobacterium 
reduced luminal succinate levels and restored colonization resistance in UC-HMA 
mice. IL-22-mediated host glycosylation thus fosters the growth of commensal 
bacteria that compete with C. difficile for the nutritional niche.
