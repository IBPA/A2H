Unlike the native protein, a nontoxic peptide (repeating unit of the native 
toxin designated rARU) from Clostridium difficile toxin A (CDTA) afforded an 
antigen that could be bound covalently to the surface polysaccharides of 
pneumococcus type 14, Shigella flexneri type 2a, and Escherichia coli K1. The 
yields of these polysaccharide-protein conjugates were significantly increased 
by prior treatment of rARU with succinic anhydride. Conjugates, prepared with 
rARU or succinylated (rARUsucc), were administered to mice by a clinically 
relevant dosage and immunization scheme. All conjugates elicited high levels of 
serum immunoglobulin G both to the polysaccharides and to CDTA. 
Conjugate-induced anti-CDTA had neutralizing activity in vitro and protected 
mice challenged with CDTA, similar to the rARU alone. Conjugates prepared with 
succinylated rARU, therefore, have potential for serving both as effective 
carrier proteins for polysaccharides and for preventing enteric disease caused 
by C. difficile.
