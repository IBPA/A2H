Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium and is the most commonly 
diagnosed cause of hospital-associated and antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. 
Despite the emergence of epidemic C. difficile strains having led to an increase 
in the incidence of the disease, a vaccine against this pathogen is not 
currently available. C. difficile strains produce two main toxins (TcdA and 
TcdB) and express three highly complex cell-surface polysaccharides (PSI, PSII 
and PSIII). PSII is the more abundantly expressed by most C. difficile ribotypes 
offering the opportunity of the development of a carbohydrate-based vaccine. In 
this paper, we evaluate the efficacy, in naive mice model, of PSII 
glycoconjugates where recombinant toxins A and B fragments (TcdA_B2 and TcdB_GT 
respectively) have been used as carriers. Both glycoconjugates elicited IgG 
titers anti-PSII although only the TcdB_GT conjugate induced a response 
comparable to that obtained with CRM197. Moreover, TcdA_B2 and TcdB_GT 
conjugated to PSII retained the ability to elicit IgG with neutralizing activity 
against the respective toxins. These results are a crucial proof of concept for 
the development of glycoconjugate vaccines against C. difficile infection (CDI) 
that combine different C. difficile antigens to potentially prevent bacterial 
colonization of the gut and neutralize toxin activity.
