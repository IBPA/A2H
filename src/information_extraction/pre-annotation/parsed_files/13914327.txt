Occurrence of Clostridium difficile in infections of man. J. Bacteriol. 
84:65-67. 1962-Eight strains of Clostridium difficile were isolated from cases 
of infection in man in seven different bacteriological laboratories. One of 
these was isolated from a case of gas gangrene, one from an abscess following a 
fractured femur, one from a blood culture from an infant, two from pleural 
fluid, two from peritoneal fluid, and one from an abscess in the vaginal vault. 
There was no evidence, in these cases, that C. difficile is pathogenic for man. 
All strains were typical morphologically and culturally and were lethal when 
inoculated intramuscularly into guinea pigs.
