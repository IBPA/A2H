BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nerves have been suggested to mediate the effects of 
bacterial toxins in intestinal diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are 
unknown. This study examined endogenous substance P (SP) activation of the 
substance P receptor (SPR) on enteric neurons in the rat ileum after exposure to 
intraluminal Clostridium difficile toxin A.
METHODS: After intraluminal injection of toxin A in ileal loops, tissue was 
examined for pathological changes by histology and for SPR activation by 
immunocytochemical analysis of SP-induced SPR endocytosis.
RESULTS: After toxin A administration, > 70% of enteric neurons showed SPR 
endocytosis and became swollen with thickened dendrites. In contrast, SPRs in 
control rats were largely confined to the plasma membrane. Rats denervated of 
primary afferent fibers with neonatal capsaicin injection and animals pretreated 
with a nonpeptide SPR antagonist showed few endosomal SPRs, and the pathological 
inflammatory effects of toxin A were ablated.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal toxin A causes the release of SP from primary afferent 
neurons: this endogenous SP then acts on enteric neurons in the submucosal and 
myenteric plexuses. SP is the primary mediator of an axon reflex mediating 
neurogenic inflammation in the intestine. SPR blockade may prove to be a novel 
therapy used to prevent intestinal inflammation.
