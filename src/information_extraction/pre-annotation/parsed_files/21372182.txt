Clostridium difficile is the major cause of antibiotic-associated colitis, a 
disease with significant morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the 
role of the haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/carbon monoxide (CO) pathway in C. difficile 
toxin A-induced enteritis in mice. The HO substrate haemin, zinc protoporphyrin 
IX (ZnPP IX), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, dimanganese decacarbonyl (DMDC), a CO 
donor, or an equivalent volume of their respective vehicles were injected 
subcutaneously 30 min prior to local challenge with toxin A (25 or 50 µg per 
ileal loop) or PBS. Intestinal ileal loop weight/length ratios were calculated 3 
h later. Ileal tissues were collected for histological analysis and measurement 
of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and 
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) production by ELISA and immunohistochemistry for 
HO-1. Treatment of mice subjected to C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) with haemin or 
DMDC prevented oedema, mucosal disruption and neutrophil infiltration observed 
in histological analysis. It also decreased TcdA-induced MPO activity and TNF-α 
or IL-1β production. In contrast, the specific HO-1 inhibitor (ZnPP IX) 
exacerbated all these evaluated parameters. TcdA increased HO-1 expression as 
seen by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that the HO-1/CO pathway 
exerts a protective role in TcdA-induced enteritis and that its pharmacological 
modulation might be important for the management of C. difficile-associated 
disease.
