The present study aimed to elucidate the prevalence of Clostridioides difficile 
in Japanese retail food products. For this purpose, retail food samples (242 
fresh vegetables and 266 retail meat samples: 89 chicken meat; 28 chicken liver; 
200 pork meat; 24 pig liver; 127 beef meat) were collected from 14 supermarkets 
between 2015 and 2019. C. difficile was isolated from eight (3.3%) fresh 
vegetable, six (6.7%) chicken meat, one (3.6%) chicken liver, one (0.5%) pork 
meat, and two (1.6%) beef meat samples; it was not isolated from pig liver. Of 
these isolates, 35% were toxigenic. All isolates were typable by PCR ribotyping 
and were resolved into 12 PCR ribotypes. Among these isolates, ribotype 014, 
which is distributed worldwide including in Japanese clinical cases, was 
detected among vegetable isolates. Therefore, although the C. difficile 
contamination rate in Japanese retail foods was low, these sources can be 
contaminated and could transmit these bacteria to humans.
