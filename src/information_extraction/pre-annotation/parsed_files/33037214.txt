Many intestinal pathogens, including Clostridioides difficile, use mucus-derived 
sugars as crucial nutrients in the gut. Commensals that compete with pathogens 
for such nutrients are therefore ecological gatekeepers in healthy guts, and are 
attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there is a 
poor understanding of which commensals use mucin-derived sugars in situ as well 
as their potential to impede pathogen colonization. Here, we identify mouse gut 
commensals that utilize mucus-derived monosaccharides within complex communities 
using single-cell stable isotope probing, Raman-activated cell sorting and 
mini-metagenomics. Sequencing of cell-sorted fractions reveals members of the 
underexplored family Muribaculaceae as major mucin monosaccharide foragers, 
followed by members of Lachnospiraceae, Rikenellaceae, and Bacteroidaceae 
families. Using this information, we assembled a five-member consortium of 
sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine utilizers that impedes C. difficile's access 
to these mucosal sugars and impairs pathogen colonization in antibiotic-treated 
mice. Our findings underscore the value of targeted approaches to identify 
organisms utilizing key nutrients and to rationally design effective probiotic 
mixtures.
