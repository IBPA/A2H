Clostridium difficile causes nearly 500,000 infections and nearly 30,000 deaths 
each year in the U.S., which is estimated to cost $4.8 billion. C. difficile 
infection (CDI) arises from bacteria colonizing the large intestine and 
releasing two toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB). Generating humoral 
immunity against C. difficile's toxins provides protection against primary 
infection and recurrence. Thus, a vaccine may offer the best opportunity for 
sustained, long-term protection. We developed a novel single-cycle adenovirus 
(SC-Ad) vaccine against C. difficile expressing the receptor-binding domains 
from TcdA and TcdB. The single immunization of mice generated sustained 
toxin-binding antibody responses and protected them from lethal toxin challenge 
for up to 38 weeks. Immunized Syrian hamsters produced significant 
toxin-neutralizing antibodies that increased over 36 weeks. Single intramuscular 
immunization provided complete protection against lethal BI/NAP1/027 spore 
challenge 45 weeks later. These data suggest that this replicating vaccine may 
prove useful against CDI in humans.
