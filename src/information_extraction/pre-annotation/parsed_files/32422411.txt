Clostridioides difficile colonizes the intestines of susceptible individuals and 
releases toxins that mediate disease. To replicate and expand in the intestines, 
C. difficile ferments proline, and this activity is influenced by the 
availability of proline and trace nutrients. C. difficile must also compete with 
the commensal microbiota for these limited nutrients. The specific microbes 
present in the intestines that may shape the ability of C. difficile to benefit 
from proline fermentation are unknown. In this study we developed a panel of 
commensal Clostridia to test the hypothesis that the microbiota influences 
C. difficile growth through proline fermentation. The experimental panel of 
Clostridia was composed of murine and human isolates that ranged in their 
capacity to ferment proline in different media. Competition between wild type 
C. difficile and a mutant strain unable to ferment proline (prdB:CT) in the 
presence of these Clostridia revealed that bacteria closely related to 
Paraclostridium benzoelyticum and Paeniclostridium spp. decreased the benefit to 
C. difficile provided by proline fermentation. Conversely, Clostridium 
xylanolyticum drove C. difficile towards an increased reliance on proline 
fermentation for growth. Overall, the ability of C. difficile to benefit from 
proline fermentation is contextual and in part dependent on the microbiota.
