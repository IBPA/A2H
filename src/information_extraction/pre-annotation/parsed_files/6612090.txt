Small quantities of low-molecular weight peptides have been characterized in the 
feces of axenic mice. In fecal material of axenic mice fed an autoclaved 
synthetic (SN) diet, we isolated a dipeptide and characterized its structure as 
beta-aspartyl-epsilon-lysine. This product was also present in the feces of 
gnotobiotic mice harbouring Clostridium perenne. We could not detect the product 
in the fecal contents of holoxenic mice, Clostridium difficile-contaminated mice 
or axenic mice fed the irradiated SN diet. The peptide, 
beta-aspartyl-epsilon-lysine, was produced by heating proteins during 
sterilization, causing the formation of a pseudopeptide bond between the 
epsilon-amino group of lysine and the amide group of asparagine. The intestinal 
strains seemed to differ in their ability to split this pseudopeptide bond in 
vivo.
