Clostridium difficile toxin A was purified to homogeneity and was used to raise 
monospecific antiserum in rabbits. A gene bank of C. difficile DNA in 
Escherichia coli was constructed by cloning Sau3A-cleaved clostridial DNA 
fragments into the bacteriophage vector lambda EMBL3. Out of 4500 plaques 
screened with antitoxin A, 9 clones were positively identified. One of these 
clones lambda tA5 expressed a 235 kDa protein which exhibited a cytotonic effect 
on Chinese hamster ovary cells, and had the ability to haemagglutinate rabbit 
erythrocytes, both properties characteristic of toxin A. The size of the lambda 
tA5 insert DNA was 14.3 kb.
