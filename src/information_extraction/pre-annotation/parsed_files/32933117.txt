Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that causes 
a severe intestinal infection. Spores of this pathogen enter in the human body 
through the oral route, interact with intestinal epithelial cells and persist in 
the gut. Once germinated, the vegetative cells colonize the intestine and 
produce toxins that enhance an immune response that perpetuate the disease. 
Therefore, spores are major players of the infection and ideal targets for new 
therapies. In this context, spore surface proteins of C. difficile, are 
potential antigens for the development of vaccines targeting C. difficile 
spores. Here, we report that the C-terminal domain of the spore surface protein 
BclA3, BclA3CTD, was identified as an antigenic epitope, over-produced in 
Escherichia coli and tested as an immunogen in mice. To increase antigen 
stability and efficiency, BclA3CTD was also exposed on the surface of B. 
subtilis spores, a mucosal vaccine delivery system. In the experimental 
conditions used in this study, free BclA3CTD induced antibody production in mice 
and attenuated some C. difficile infection symptoms after a challenge with the 
pathogen, while the spore-displayed antigen resulted less effective. Although 
dose regimen and immunization routes need to be optimized, our results suggest 
BclA3CTD as a potentially effective antigen to develop a new vaccination 
strategy targeting C. difficile spores.
