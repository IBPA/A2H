The pathogenicity of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is mediated by the 
release of two toxins, A and B. Both toxins contain large clusters of repeats 
known as cell wall binding (CWB) domains responsible for binding epithelial cell 
surfaces. Several murine monoclonal antibodies were generated against the CWB 
domain of toxin A and screened for their ability to neutralize the toxin 
individually and in combination. Three antibodies capable of neutralizing toxin 
A all recognized multiple sites on toxin A, suggesting that the extent of 
surface coverage may contribute to neutralization. Combination of two 
noncompeting antibodies, denoted 3358 and 3359, enhanced toxin A neutralization 
over saturating levels of single antibodies. Antibody 3358 increased the level 
of detectable CWB domain on the surface of cells, while 3359 inhibited CWB 
domain cell surface association. These results suggest that antibody 
combinations that cover a broader epitope space on the CWB repeat domains of 
toxin A (and potentially toxin B) and utilize multiple mechanisms to reduce 
toxin internalization may provide enhanced protection against C. 
difficile-associated diarrhea.
