Clostridioides difficile is the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
and colitis, a healthcare-associated intestinal disease resulting in a 
significant fatality rate. Colonization of the gut is critical for C. difficile 
pathogenesis. The bacterial molecules essential for efficient colonization 
therefore offer great potential as vaccine candidates. Here we present findings 
demonstrating that the C. difficile immunogenic lipoprotein CD0873 plays a 
critical role in pathogen success in vivo We found that in a dixenic 
colonization model, a CD0873-positive strain of C. difficile significantly 
outcompeted a CD0873-negative strain. Immunization of mice with recombinant 
CD0873 prevented long-term gut colonization and was correlated with a strong 
secretory IgA immune response. We further present high-resolution crystal 
structures of CD0873, at 1.35-2.50 Ã… resolutions, offering a first view of the 
ligand-binding pocket of CD0873 and provide evidence that this lipoprotein 
adhesin is part of a tyrosine import system, an amino acid key in C. difficile 
infection. These findings suggest that CD0873 could serve as an effective 
component in a vaccine against C. difficile.
