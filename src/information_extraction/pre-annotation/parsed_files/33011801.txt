Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) represents a significant burden on the 
health care system, one that is exacerbated by the emergence of binary toxin 
(CDT)-producing hypervirulent C. difficile strains. Previous work from our lab 
has shown that TLR2 recognizes CDT to induce inflammation. Here we explore the 
interactions of CDT with TLR2 and the impact on host immunity during CDI. We 
found that the TLR2/6 heterodimer, not TLR2/1, is responsible for CDT 
recognition, and that gene pathways including NF-κB and MAPK downstream of 
TLR2/6 are upregulated in mice with intact TLR2/6 signaling during CDI.
