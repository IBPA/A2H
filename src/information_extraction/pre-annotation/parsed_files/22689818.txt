Clostridium difficile can infect the large intestine and cause colitis when the 
normal intestinal microbiota is altered by antibiotic administration. Little is 
known about the innate immune signaling pathways that marshal inflammatory 
responses to C. difficile infection and whether protective and pathogenic 
inflammatory responses can be dissociated. Toll-like receptors predominantly 
signal via the MyD88 adaptor protein and are important mediators of innate 
immune signaling in the intestinal mucosa. Here, we demonstrate that 
MyD88-mediated signals trigger neutrophil and CCR2-dependent Ly6C(hi) monocyte 
recruitment to the colonic lamina propria (cLP) during infection, which prevent 
dissemination of bystander bacteria to deeper tissues. Mortality is markedly 
increased in MyD88-deficient mice following C. difficile infection, as are 
parameters of mucosal tissue damage and inflammation. Antibody-mediated 
depletion of neutrophils markedly increases mortality, while attenuated 
recruitment of Ly6C(hi) monocytes in CCR2-deficient mice does not alter the 
course of C. difficile infection. Expression of CXCL1, a neutrophil-recruiting 
chemokine, is impaired in the cLP of MyD88(-/-) mice. Our studies suggest that 
MyD88-mediated signals promote neutrophil recruitment by inducing expression of 
CXCL1, thereby providing critical early defense against C. difficile-mediated 
colitis.
