Clostridium difficile can cause neonatal enteritis, but has been isolated from 
both diseased and healthy pigs. C. difficile shedding by pigs is a potential 
source of zoonotic transmission to humans. The objectives of this study were to 
characterize the prevalence and genotype of C. difficile with respect to age and 
health status in the pig industry for the first time in Korea. Fecal samples of 
910 pigs were analyzed for the presence of C. difficile. In total, 176 (19.3%) 
C. difficile strains were isolated. The prevalence was significantly higher 
(p < 0.01) in diarrheic samples (30.4%) than in non-diarrheic samples (13.3%). 
The prevalence was highest in diarrheic suckling piglets (53.6%), followed by 
diarrheic sows (40.0%) and non-diarrheic suckling piglets (34.0%). The toxin 
genes tcdA, tcdB, cdtA, and cdtB were all detected in 153 isolates (A+B+CDT+, 
86.9%). Furthermore, the majority of toxigenic strains (86.5%) were identified 
as PCR ribotype 078, which is an important pathogen in both pigs and humans. 
These results indicated that C. difficile is a leading causative pathogen of 
neonatal diarrhea in piglets in Korea.
