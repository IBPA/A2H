Clostridium difficile is a pathogen with increasing severity for which host 
antibody responses provide protection from disease. DNA vaccination has several 
advantages compared to traditional vaccine methods, however no study has 
examined this platform against C. difficile toxins. A synthetic gene was created 
encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of C. difficile toxin A, optimized 
for expression in human cells. Gene expression was examined in vitro. Mice were 
inoculated and then challenged with parenteral toxin A. Vaccination provided 
high titer antibodies and protected mice from death. This represents the first 
report of DNA vaccine inducing neutralizing antibodies to C. difficile toxin A.
