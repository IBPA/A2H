Clostridium difficile is responsible for a large proportion of nosocomial cases 
of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The present 
study provides evidence that yeast, beef and pork extracts, ingredients commonly 
used to grow bacteria, can counteract C. difficile toxin A enterotoxicity in 
vitro and in vivo. In model intestinal epithelial cells the individual extracts 
could prevent the toxin A-induced decrease in epithelial barrier function and 
partially prevented actin disaggregation and cell rounding. Mice with ad libitum 
access to individual extracts for 1 week had almost complete reduction in toxin 
A-induced fluid secretion in intestinal loops. Concomitantly, the toxin 
A-induced expression of the essential proinflammatory mediator Cox-2 was 
normalized. Moreover this protective effect was also seen when mice received 
only two doses of extract by intragastric gavage within 1 week. These results 
show that yeast, beef and pork extracts have the potential to counteract the 
intestinal pathogenesis triggered by C. difficile toxin A.
