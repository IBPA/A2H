The clinical benefits observed with probiotic use are mainly attributed to the 
antimicrobial substances produced by probiotic strains and to their 
immunomodulatory effects. Currently, the best-documented probiotic bacteria used 
in human therapy are lactic acid bacteria. In contrast, studies aiming to 
characterize the mechanisms responsible for the probiotic beneficial effects of 
Bacillus are rare. The current work seeks to contribute to such characterization 
by evaluating the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of probiotic B. 
clausii strains. B. clausii strains release antimicrobial substances in the 
medium. Moreover, the release of these antimicrobial substances was observed 
during stationary growth phase and coincided with sporulation. These substances 
were active against Gram-positive bacteria, in particular against Staphylococcus 
aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium difficile. The antimicrobial 
activity was resistant to subtilisin, proteinase K, and chymotrypsin treatment, 
whereas it was sensitive to pronase treatment. The evaluation of the 
immunomodulatory properties of probiotic B. clausii strains was performed in 
vitro on Swiss and C57 Bl/6j murine cells. The authors demonstrate that these 
strains, in their vegetative forms, are able to induce NOS II synthetase 
activity, IFN-gamma production, and CD4 T-cell proliferation.
