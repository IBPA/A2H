A major challenge for chemotherapy of bacterial infections is perturbation of 
the intestinal microbiota. Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium 
of the gut that can thrive under this circumstance. Its production of dormant 
and antibiotic-impervious spores results in chronic disruption of normal gut 
flora and debilitating diarrhea and intestinal infection. C. difficile is 
responsible for 12,800 deaths per year in the United States. Here, we report the 
discovery of 
2-(4-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)phenoxy)picolinamido)benzo[d]oxazole-5-carboxylate as 
an antibacterial with potent and selective activity against C. difficile. Its 
MIC50 and MIC90 (the concentration required to inhibit the growth of 50% and 90% 
of all the tested strains, respectively) values, documented across 101 strains 
of C. difficile, are 0.12 and 0.25 μg/mL, respectively. The compound targets 
cell wall biosynthesis, as assessed by macromolecular biosynthesis assays and by 
scanning electron microscopy. Animals infected with a lethal dose of 
C. difficile and treated with compound 1 had a similar survival compared to 
treatment with vancomycin, which is the frontline antibiotic used for 
C. difficile infection.
