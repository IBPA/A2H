Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is considered to be the major cause of the 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in animals and 
humans. The prevalence of C. difficile infections (CDI) has been increasing 
since 2000. Two exotoxins of C. difficile, Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB), 
are the main virulence factors of CDI, which can induce glucosylation of Rho 
GTPases in host cytosol, leading to cell morphological changes, cell apoptosis, 
and cell death. The mechanism of TcdB-induced cell death has been investigated 
for decades, but it is still not completely understood. It has been reported 
that TcdB induces endoplasmic reticulum stress via PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway 
in CT26 cell line (BALB/C mouse colon tumor cells). In this study, we found that 
salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, efficiently 
protects CT26 cell line against TcdB-induced cell death and tried to explore the 
mechanism underlying in this protective effect. Our results demonstrated that 
salubrinal protects CT26 cells from TcdB-mediated cytotoxic and cytopathic 
effect, inhibits apoptosis and death of the toxin-exposed cells via 
caspase-9-dependent pathway, eIF2α signaling pathway, and autophagy. These 
findings will be helpful for the development of CDI therapies.
