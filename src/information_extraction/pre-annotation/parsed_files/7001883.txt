Fourteen microbial strains isolated from conventional rats were inoculated into 
axenic rats and mice receiving identical diets. The populations of these 
organisms which became established in the feces of gnotobiotic adult recipient 
rats and mice were quite similar. The only major difference was that one strain, 
belonging to the genus Clostridium, disappeared from the feces of gnotobiotic 
mice, whereas this strain became established in gnotobiotic rats. Most of the 
strictly anaerobic strains were absent or present only in small numbers before 
weaning in young rats and mice. A clear-cut barrier effect against Salmonella 
typhimurium was found in adult gnotobiotic mice colonized with a complex flora 
derived from a conventional chicken. The microflora established in these 
recipient mice exerted the same barrier effect when further transferred into 
axenic chickens. Inoculation of feces from a human donor into adult gnotobiotic 
recipient mice produced colonization by several strains from the donor, whereas 
other strains, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and 
Clostridium were present in the donor, but did not persist in recipient mice. In 
these mice, nonetheless, the colonizing human fecal flora exerted an effective 
barrier against a toxigenic strain of Clostridium difficile. This barrier effect 
spontaneously disappeared several weeks later. Administration of clindamycin to 
the recipient mice led to large variations in the number of viable cells of C. 
difficile.
