The increased incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in 
older adults (age, ≥65 years) corresponds with the emergence of the BI/NAP1 
strain, making elucidation of the host immune response extremely important. We 
therefore infected germ-free C57BL/6 mice aged 7-14 months with a BI/NAP1 strain 
and monitored the mice for response. Infected mice were moribund 48-72 h after 
infection and developed gross and histological cecitis and colitis and elevated 
concentrations of keratinocyte chemoattractant, interleukin 1β, monocyte 
chemotactic protein 1, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and decreased 
levels of interferon γ, interleukin 12 p40, interleukin 12 p70, and interleukin 
10 compared with controls. We conclude that aged, germ-free C57BL/6 mice are 
susceptible to fulminant CDI from a BI/NAP1 strain and represent a novel model 
to further elucidate the host immune response to acute CDI.
