Intestinal colonization with toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile was 
documented in 9 of 10 horses with acute onset diarrhea in a veterinary medical 
teaching hospital, whereas a similar isolate was detected in only 1 of 23 other 
horses without diarrhea in the hospital. One horse with diarrhea was infected 
simultaneously with both C. difficile and Salmonella krefeld. Clostridium 
difficile was detected by fecal culture on selective medium, confirmed with a 
latex particle agglutination test, and identified as toxigenic by polymerase 
chain reaction amplification of toxin A and toxin B gene sequences. Using an 
arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction, 6 distinct C. difficile isolates 
were detected in the feces of the 9 affected horses at the time of the outbreak 
of diarrhea.
