In rat intestinal crypt cells, Clostridium difficile toxin A induces (i) early 
cytoskeletal alterations involving the whole population and (ii) late effects in 
30 to 40% of the cells, consisting mainly of surface blebbing and nuclear 
fragmentation. All these effects were Ca2+ independent and were not abolished by 
protein synthesis inhibitors.
