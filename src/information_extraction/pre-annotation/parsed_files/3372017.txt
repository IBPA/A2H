In previous studies, we showed that diet composition or Saccharomyces boulardii 
ingestion could protect gnotobiotic mice against lethal Clostridium difficile 
infection. Using an original method, we detected nontoxinogenic clones from 
feces of protected mice challenged with a toxinogenic clone of C. difficile. 
These clones became established at the same level as the toxinogenic one after 
about 30 days. In these protected mice bearing nontoxinogenic clones, no 
enterotoxin production could be detected and cytotoxin titers were highly 
reduced. These nontoxinogenic clones were genetically stable because 
nontoxinogenic clones and clones that produce intermediate levels of toxins in 
vivo did not revert to toxin production, even after repeated culture in vitro. 
Furthermore, the nontoxinogenic clones were shown to arise from a single 
toxinogenic clone and were identical to that clone in metabolic patterns and 
antibiotic sensitivity tests. When mice fed a nonprotective diet were challenged 
with a nontoxinogenic or intermediate clone, they remained healthy and no toxin 
production could be detected in their feces. Moreover, these mice were protected 
against further infections with toxinogenic strains of C. difficile, and a 
strong antagonism between nontoxinogenic and toxinogenic clones was observed.
