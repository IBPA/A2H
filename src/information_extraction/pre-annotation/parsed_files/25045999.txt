Clostridium difficile infection in antibiotic-treated mice results in acute 
colitis characterized by severe intestinal histopathology, robust neutrophil 
influx, and increased expression of numerous inflammatory cytokines, including 
GM-CSF. We utilized a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GM-CSF in a 
murine model to study the role of GM-CSF during acute C. difficile colitis. 
Cefoperazone-treated mice were challenged with C. difficile (strain 630) spores. 
Expression of GM-CSF was significantly increased in animals challenged with C. 
difficile. Treatment with an anti-GM-CSF mAb did not alter C. difficile 
colonization levels, weight loss, or expression of IL-22 and RegIIIγ. However, 
expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β, as well as iNOS, was 
significantly reduced following anti-GM-CSF treatment. Expression of the 
neutrophil chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, but not the chemokines CCL2, CCL4, CXCL9, 
and CXCL10, was significantly reduced by anti-GM-CSF treatment. Consistent with 
a decrease in neutrophil-attractant chemokine expression, there were fewer 
neutrophils in histology sections and a reduction in the expression of secretory 
leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a tissue anti-protease that protects 
against damage by secreted neutrophil elastase. These data indicate that GM-CSF 
plays a role in the inflammatory signaling network that drives neutrophil 
recruitment in response to C. difficile infection but does not appear to play a 
role in clearance of the infection.
