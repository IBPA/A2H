Ceftobiprole and ceftobiprole medocaril did not promote growth of or toxin 
production by Clostridium difficile in mouse cecal contents, whereas 
ceftazidime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ertapenem did. The 
relatively low propensity of ceftobiprole to promote C. difficile was 
attributable to inhibitory activity against C. difficile and sparing of 
anaerobic microflora.
