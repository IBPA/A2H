BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile toxin A is a potent intestinal 
inflammatory agent that has been shown to act at least partially by neurogenic 
mechanisms involving activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 
(TRPV1) (capsaicin) receptor. We tested the hypothesis that leukotriene B4 
(LTB4) mediates the effects of toxin A via activation of the TRPV1 receptor.
METHODS: Isolated rat ileal segments were pretreated with pharmacologic agents 
before intraluminal injection of toxin A or LTB4. After 3 hours, the treated 
segments were removed and inflammation was assessed by luminal fluid 
accumulation, myeloperoxidase activity, and histology.
RESULTS: LTB4 caused ileitis similar to that caused by toxin A and antagonism of 
TRPV1 receptors but not LTB4 receptors inhibited LTB4-induced inflammation. LTB4 
also stimulated TRPV1-mediated substance P release and pretreatment with a 
specific substance P-receptor antagonist blocked LTB4-induced substance P action 
and ileitis. Inhibition of the LTB4 biosynthetic enzyme 5-lipoxygenase inhibited 
toxin A-induced increases in ileal LTB4 levels and toxin A- but not LTB4-induced 
ileitis.
CONCLUSIONS: LTB4 mediates the inflammatory effects of toxin A via activation of 
TRPV1 receptors.
