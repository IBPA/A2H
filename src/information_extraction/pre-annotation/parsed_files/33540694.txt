Clostridioides difficile is the main cause of health-care-associated infectious 
diarrhoea. Toxins, TcdA and TcdB, secreted by this bacterium damage colonic 
epithelial cells and in severe cases this culminates in pseudomembranous 
colitis, toxic megacolon and death. Vaccines in human trials have focused 
exclusively on the parenteral administration of toxin-based formulations. These 
vaccines promote toxin-neutralising serum antibodies but fail to confer 
protection from infection in the gut. An effective route to immunise against gut 
pathogens and stimulate a protective mucosal antibody response (secretory 
immunoglobulin A, IgA) at the infection site is the oral route. Additionally, 
oral immunisation generates systemic antibodies (IgG). Using this route, two 
different antigens were tested in the hamster model: The colonisation factor 
CD0873 and a TcdB fragment. Animals immunised with CD0873 generated a 
significantly higher titre of sIgA in intestinal fluid and IgG in serum compared 
to naive animals, which significantly inhibited the adherence of C. difficile to 
Caco-2 cells. Following challenge with a hypervirulent isolate, the 
CD0873-immunised group showed a mean increase of 80% in time to experimental 
endpoint compared to na√Øve animals. Survival and body condition correlated with 
bacterial clearance and reduced pathology in the cecum. Our findings advocate 
CD0873 as a promising oral vaccine candidate against C. difficile.
