Clostridioides difficile, formerly known as Clostridium difficile, is a 
spore-forming bacterium considered as the most common cause of nosocomial 
infections in developed countries. The spore of C. difficile is involved in the 
transmission of the pathogen and in its first interaction with the host; 
therefore, a therapeutic approach able to control C. difficile spores would 
improve the clearance of the infection. The C-terminal (CTD) end of BclA2, a 
spore surface protein of C. difficile responsible of the interaction with the 
host intestinal cells, was selected as a putative mucosal antigen. The BclA2 
fragment, BclA2CTD, was purified and used to nasally immunize mice both as a 
free protein and after adsorption to the spore of Bacillus subtilis, a 
well-established mucosal delivery vehicle. While the adsorption to spores 
increased the in vitro stability of BclA2CTD, in vivo both free and 
spore-adsorbed BclA2CTD were able to induce a similar, specific humoral immune 
response in a murine model. Although in the experimental conditions utilized the 
immune response was not protective, the induction of specific IgG indicates that 
free or spore-bound BclA2CTD could act as a putative mucosal antigen targeting 
C. difficile spores.
