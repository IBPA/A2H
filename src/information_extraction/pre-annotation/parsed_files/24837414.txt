Clostridium difficile, a highly drug-resistant Gram-positive, spore-forming 
bacterium, remains a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhoea and 
antibiotic-associated colitis. Clinically, only a handful of antibiotics are 
used for treating C. difficile infection (CDI), suggesting a necessity for the 
development of new treatment options. Here we performed a high-throughput screen 
of 2000 drug-like compounds for inhibition of C. difficile. From this screen, 
one compound, 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline (5-NP), showed potent bactericidal 
effects in vitro. In addition, this compound displayed high potency towards 
other Clostridium spp. as well as Mycobacterium bovis but not towards other 
tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we show that this 
inhibition may proceed through a metal chelation-dependent mechanism. More 
importantly, preliminary evidence suggests moderate efficacy for this compound 
in treating CDI in a murine infection model. These results present a possible 
basis for the further development of this compound as an antibiotic treatment 
for CDI.
