Seventy-four 9-week old female C57BL/6J mice housed in a conventional facility 
were manipulated to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, among 
which 26 developed clinical signs including lethargy, absence of defecation, and 
abdominal distension. By gross necropsy examination, there was distension of the 
cecum and colon with fecal impaction. By histologic examination, there was 
severe ulcerative and proliferative typhlocolitis. Fecal ELISA confirmed the 
presence of toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile. Alteration in immune status 
of the immunocompetent mice, due to stress caused by experimental manipulation 
or autoimmune disease, may have led to intestinal dysbiosis, followed by 
opportunistic infections resulting in C. difficile-associated disease. This 
report brings to light the occurrence of the disease in immunocompetent 
laboratory mice during experimental manipulations associated with alteration in 
immune status, and it discusses potential hazards associated with conventional 
housing within a hospital-associated research institute.
