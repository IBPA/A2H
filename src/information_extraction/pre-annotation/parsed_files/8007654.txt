Sporadic diarrhea and weight loss were observed in a breeding colony of Syrian 
hamsters during a 2-year period. Thirteen adult hamsters with diarrhea, 
anorexia, and weight loss were examined. Histologic lesions consisted of diffuse 
nonsuppurative enterocecocolitis and multifocal epithelial proliferation in the 
cecum and colon. Goblet cell hyperplasia was extensive in the colonic mucosa of 
many hamsters. The hamsters in this colony had not been treated with antibiotics 
nor was Clostridium difficile isolated from any of the hamsters. In contrast to 
typical proliferative ileitis in hamsters, most hamsters involved in this 
outbreak were mature adults rather than weanlings, and lesions were 
predominantly inflammatory rather than proliferative and involved small 
intestine, cecum, and colon rather than ileum. The isolation of beta-hemolytic 
Escherichia coli and demonstration of Campylobacter-like organisms by 
transmission electron microscopy and Warthin-Starry staining suggest that these 
two agents were involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Further studies, 
however, are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of this enteric syndrome in 
hamsters.
