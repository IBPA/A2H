OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic effects of dietary supplementation on 
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).
BACKGROUND: With limited treatment options, the rise of C. difficile-associated 
disease has spurred on the search for novel therapies. Recent data define a role 
for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and diet-derived AHR ligands in mucosal 
immunity. We investigated the efficacy of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a dietary 
supplement, and AHR precursor ligand in a murine model of CDI.
METHODS: C57BL/6 (B6), AHR, and AHR mice were placed on either grain-based or 
semipurified diets with or without I3C before and during CDI. Mice were followed 
clinically for a minimum of 6 days or euthanized between days 0 and 4 of 
inoculation for analysis of the inflammatory response and microbiota.
RESULTS: B6 mice fed an AHR ligand-deficient, semipurified diet have 
significantly increased disease severity (P<0.001) and mortality (P < 0.001) 
compared with mice fed on diet containing I3C. The addition of I3C to the diet 
of AHR null mice had less of an impact than in AHR heterozygous littermates, 
although some protection was seen. Mice on semipurified I3C-diet had increased 
cecal Tregs, ILC3s, and γδ T cells and an increased neutrophilic response 
without increased inflammation or bacterial translocation compared with 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: I3C is a powerful treatment to reduce impact of CDI in mice. The 
findings indicate I3C may be acting through both AHR-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms in this model. Dietary supplementation with I3C is a potential new 
therapy for prevention and amelioration of C. difficile disease.
