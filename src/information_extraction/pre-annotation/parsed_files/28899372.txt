BACKGROUND: Bacillus subtilis spores can be used for presentation of 
heterologous proteins. Two main approaches have been developed, the recombinant 
one, requiring modification of bacterial genome to express a protein of interest 
as a fusion with spore-coat protein, and non-recombinant, based on the 
adsorption of a heterologous protein onto the spore. So far only single proteins 
have been displayed on the spore surface.
RESULTS: We have used a combined approach to adsorb and display FliD protein of 
Clostridium difficile on the surface of recombinant IL-2-presenting spores. Such 
spores presented FliD protein with efficiency comparable to FliD-adsorbed spores 
produced by wild-type 168 strain and elicited FliD-specific immune response in 
intranasally immunized mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that such dual display technology may be 
useful in creation of spores simultaneously presenting adjuvant and antigen 
molecules. Regarding the characteristics of elicited immune response it seems 
plausible that such recombinant IL-2-presenting spores with adsorbed FliD 
protein might be an interesting candidate for vaccine against infections with 
Clostridium difficile.
