Several lines of evidence indicate that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
associated with Clostridium difficile (CD) infection as a consequence of gut 
dysbiosis. Currently available treatments of IBD are either not very effective 
or have adverse effects. Pyungwi-san (PWS), a traditional Chinese herbal 
formulation, has long been used to treat gastrointestinal disorders. The present 
study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of PWS against dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS) + CD-induced IBD in mice. The animals received DSS in drinking 
water for seven days to produce DSS-induced acute colitis. In the DSS + CD 
group, the DSS-fed animals were orally administered with CD spores twice during 
the DSS treatment period. We observed that exposure of DSS + CD-treated animals 
to PWS significantly decreased the disease activity index; prevented the 
shortening of colonic length and increases in spleen size and weight; restored 
colonic histological parameters by significantly increasing mucus thickness, 
crypt depth, and goblet cell numbers; protected the tight junction proteins; 
improved the profiles of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines; and 
normalized the abundance ratio of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in the gut. Thus, 
PWS exerted a number of protective effects on DSS + CD-induced colitis, which 
might be mediated via restoration of a balance in gut microbial communities.
