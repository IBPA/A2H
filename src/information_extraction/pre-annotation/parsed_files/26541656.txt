BACKGROUND: Tight-junction (TJ) proteins regulate paracellular permeability. Gut 
permeability can be modulated by commensal microbiota. Manipulation of the gut 
microbiota with antibiotics like bacitracin and neomycin turned out to be useful 
for the treatment of diarrhoea induced by Clostridium difficile or chemotherapy 
drugs.
AIM: To evaluate the effects of the microbiota depletion evoked by the oral 
administration of neomycin and bacitracin on the intestinal permeability and 
expression of TJ proteins in mice.
METHODS: Mice received neomycin and bacitracin orally for 7 days. Intestinal 
permeability was measured by the fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran 
(FITC-dextran) method. The gene expression of TJ proteins in the intestine was 
determined by real time-PCR.
RESULTS: FITC-dextran levels in serum were reduced by half in antibiotic-treated 
mice, indicating a reduction of intestinal permeability. Antibiotics increased 
the expression of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), junctional adhesion molecule A 
(JAM-A, and occludin in the ileum and ZO-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in the 
colon.
CONCLUSION: The combination of neomycin and bacitracin reduce intestinal 
permeability and increase the gene expression of ZO-1, junctional adhesion 
molecule A (JAM-A), and occludin in the ileum and ZO-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 
in the colon.
