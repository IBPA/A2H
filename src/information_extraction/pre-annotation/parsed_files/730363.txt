Neutralization of Clostridium difficile toxin by Clostridium sordellii antitoxin 
was studied by cytotoxicity assay in tissue culture. The sources of toxin were 
stools from two patients with pseudomembranous colitis and a culture filtrate of 
C. difficile isolated from one of the patients. C. sordellii antitoxin was 
available either in monovalent form or as gas gangrene polyvalent antitoxin. The 
potency of antitoxins against C. difficile determined by cytotoxicity assay did 
not correlate with the established values reported for mouse protection tests 
against C. sordellii toxin. An equivalent zone of optimal neutralization was 
demonstrated for stool toxin, and a slightly different one for culture toxin. 
The rate of neutralization appeared to be instantaneous, either at 24 or at 37 
degrees C. The efficacy of antitoxin in preventing cytotoxicity in cultured 
cells preexposed to toxin decreased rapidly with preexposure time. The union 
between toxin and antitoxin could be readily dissociated by simple dilution or 
by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dissociated by simple dilution or 
by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dilution. Continued incubation of 
toxin-antitoxin mixture did not increase the firmness of the union; on the 
contrary, more dissociation occurred. The unusual looseness of the 
toxin-antitoxin union is probably relatd to lack of serological specificity or 
affinity. Based on these observations, a practical diagnostic method for 
antibiotic-induced colitis is outlined.
