As the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile is a 
serious problem in health care facilities worldwide. C. difficile produces two 
large toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which are the primary virulence factors in disease. 
The respective functions of these toxins have been difficult to discern, in part 
because the cytotoxicity profiles for these toxins differ with concentration and 
cell type. The goal of this study was to develop a cell culture model that would 
allow a side-by-side mechanistic comparison of the toxins. Conditionally 
immortalized, young adult mouse colonic (YAMC) epithelial cells demonstrate an 
exquisite sensitivity to both toxins with phenotypes that agree with 
observations in tissue explants. TcdA intoxication results in an apoptotic cell 
death that is dependent on the glucosyltransferase activity of the toxin. In 
contrast, TcdB has a bimodal mechanism; it induces apoptosis in a 
glucosyltransferase-dependent manner at lower concentrations and 
glucosyltransferase-independent necrotic death at higher concentrations. The 
direct comparison of the responses to TcdA and TcdB in cells and colonic 
explants provides the opportunity to unify a large body of observations made by 
many independent investigators.
