A lipoteichoic acid has recently been shown to be conserved in the majority of 
strains from Clostridium difficile and as such is being considered as a possible 
vaccine antigen. In this study we examine the candidacy of the conserved 
lipoteichoic acid by demonstrating that it is possible to elicit antibodies 
against C. difficile strains following immunisation of rabbits and mice with 
glycoconjugates elaborating the conserved lipoteichoic acid antigen. The present 
study describes a conjugation strategy that utilises an amino functionality, 
present at approximately 33 % substitution of the N-acetyl-glucosamine residues 
within the LTA polymer repeating unit, as the attachment point for conjugation. 
A maleimide-thiol linker strategy with the maleimide linker on the carboxyl 
residues of the carrier protein and the thiol linker on the carbohydrate was 
employed. Immunisation derived antisera from rabbits and mice, recognised all 
strains of C. difficile vegetative cells examined, despite an immune response to 
the linkers also being observed. These sera recognised live cells in an 
immunofluorescence assay and were also able to recognise the spore form of the 
bacterium. This study has illustrated that the LTA polymer is a highly conserved 
surface polymer of C. difficile that is easily accessible to the immune system 
and as such merits consideration as a vaccine antigen to combat C. difficile 
infection.
