Eleven out of 43 strains of Clostridium sordellii from clinical sources did not 
produce lecithinase activity and were not toxic to mice. However, these strains 
did belong to the C. sordellii group and could readily be differentiated from C. 
bifermentans and C. difficile on the basis of DNA-DNA homologies, carbohydrate 
fermentation patterns, enzyme activities, GLC analysis of fatty acid 
fermentation products and the electrophoretic analysis of whole cell protein 
extracts.
