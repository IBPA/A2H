BACKGROUND: Most Clostridioides difficile toxinogenic strains produce both 
toxins A and B (A+B+), but toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive (A-B+) variants 
also cause disease. We report the identification of a series of pathogenic 
clinical C. difficile isolates that produce high amounts of toxin A with low or 
nondetectable toxin B.
METHODS: An ultrasensitive, quantitative immunoassay was used to measure toxins 
A and B in stool samples from 187 C. difficile infection (CDI) patients and 44 
carriers. Isolates were cultured and assessed for in vitro toxin production and 
in vivo phenotypes (mouse CDI model).
RESULTS: There were 7 CDI patients and 6 carriers who had stools with detectable 
toxin A (TcdA, range 23-17 422 pg/mL; 5.6% of samples overall) but toxin B 
(TcdB) below the clinical detection limit (<20 pg/mL; median TcdA:B ratio 
17.93). Concentrations of toxin A far exceeded B in in vitro cultures of all 12 
recovered isolates (median TcdA:B ratio 26). Of 8 toxin A>>B isolates tested in 
mice, 4 caused diarrhea, and 3 of those 4 caused lethal disease. Ribotyping 
demonstrated strain diversity. TcdA-predominant samples were also identified at 
2 other centers, with similar frequencies (7.5% and 6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: We report the discovery of clinical pathogenic C. difficile strains 
that produce high levels of toxin A but minimal or no toxin B. This pattern of 
toxin production is not rare (>5% of isolates) and is consistently observed in 
vitro and in vivo in humans and mice. Our study highlights the significance of 
toxin A in human CDI pathogenesis and has important implications for CDI 
diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development.
