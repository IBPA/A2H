Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a growing global public health 
threat. While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for 
CDI, a number of challenges limit its application. Studies suggest that 
probiotics may be a promising alternative therapy. In the current study, we 
evaluated whether Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. thetaiotaomicron) would 
inhibit colonization of toxigenic BI/NAP1/027 C. difficile in a mouse model. We 
found that B. thetaiotaomicron administration decreased the copies of C. 
difficile and inhibited inflammation in the colon. 16S rRNA sequencing showed 
that B. thetaiotaomicron administration was associated with a significantly 
increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased level of 
Proteobacteria, leading to the reversal of the effect of antibiotics treatment 
and C. difficile infection on microbiota. B. thetaiotaomicron administration was 
associated with increases in the concentrations of alpha-muricholic acid, 
beta-muricholic acid, 12 ketolithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid which are 
known to inhibit the growth of C. difficile, as well as reductions in the level 
of taurocholic acid, which promotes germination of C. difficile. Altered profile 
of major high abundance bile acids by B. thetaiotaomicron administration was 
similar to that with FMT treatment. Based on these results, we proposed the 
concept of "the ratio of promotion/inhibition BAs" which would advance our 
understanding of the relation of C. difficile and BAs.
