In vitro activities of sulopenem, a novel parenteral penem, was compared with 
those of imipenem, flomoxef, cefuzonam, cefoperazone and sulbactam/ampicillin 
against 66 reference strains (19 genera, 61 species) and 392 recent clinical 
isolates of anaerobic bacteria and fastidious aerobic bacteria. Sulopenem had a 
very broad spectrum against anaerobic bacteria. In general, this compound was 
active against anaerobic reference strains with MICs of < or = 0.78 
micrograms/ml, while being the least active against Bifidobacterium spp. and 
less active than imipenem against Lactobacillus spp. Sulopenem was more active 
against Bacteroides fragilis isolates than imipenem and had the highest 
activities against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella intermedia, 
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. among 
the antibiotics tested. Sulopenem was not hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinase 
type 1 produced by B. fragilis GAI-0558, GAI-7955 and GAI-10150 and its 
stability was comparable to imipenem. Its susceptibilities to hydrolysis by a 
metallo-beta-lactamase from B. fragilis GAI-30144 was less than imipenem. 
Sulopenem (120 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 days) was as effective as 
imipenem/cilastatin against a mixed intraabdominal mice infection due to E. coli 
and B. fragilis. Sulopenem (20 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days) did not induce an 
overgrowth of Clostridium difficile in the caecum of mice.
