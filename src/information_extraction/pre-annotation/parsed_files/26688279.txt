Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive organism that 
is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated infectious diarrhea, commonly 
known as C. difficile infection (CDI). C. difficile spores play an important 
role in the pathogenesis of CDI. Spore proteins, especially those that are 
surface-bound may play an essential role in the germination, colonization and 
persistence of C. difficile in the human gut. In our current study, we report 
the identification of two surface-bound spore proteins, CdeC and CdeM that may 
be utilized as immunization candidates against C. difficile. These spore 
proteins are immunogenic in mice and are able to protect mice against challenge 
with C. difficile UK1, a clinically-relevant 027/B1/NAP1 strain. These spore 
proteins are also able to afford high levels of protection against challenge 
with C. difficile 630Δerm in golden Syrian hamsters. This unprecedented study 
shows the vaccination potential of C. difficile spore exosporium proteins.
