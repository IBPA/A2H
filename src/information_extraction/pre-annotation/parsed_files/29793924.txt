Pyroptosis is an inflammasome-induced lytic cell death mode, the physiological 
role of which in chronic inflammatory diseases is unknown. Familial 
Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease 
worldwide, affecting an estimated 150,000 patients. The disease is caused by 
missense mutations in Mefv that activate the Pyrin inflammasome, but the 
pathophysiologic mechanisms driving autoinflammation in FMF are incompletely 
understood. Here, we show that Clostridium difficile infection of FMF knock-in 
macrophages that express a chimeric FMF-associated MefvV726A Pyrin elicited 
pyroptosis and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. 
Importantly, in vivo GSDMD deletion abolished spontaneous autoinflammatory 
disease. GSDMD-deficient FMF knock-in mice were fully protected from the runted 
growth, anemia, systemic inflammatory cytokine production, neutrophilia, and 
tissue damage that characterize this autoinflammatory disease model. Overall, 
this work identifies pyroptosis as a critical mechanism of IL-1β-dependent 
autoinflammation in FMF and highlights GSDMD inhibition as a potential 
antiinflammatory strategy in inflammasome-driven diseases.
