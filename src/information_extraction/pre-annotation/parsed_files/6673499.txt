Clostridium difficile produces one diarrhoeogenic toxin designed A, and one 
cytopathogenic toxin designed B. Toxin A was purified in a 
four-step-fractionation procedure. In the last purification step the toxin was 
separated by elution with galactose from an agarose gel. The purified toxin A 
induced a clear and watery hypersecretion in intestinal loops of mouse, while 
mixtures of toxin A and B induced a haemorrhagic secretion. At an ED50 value for 
the purified toxin A of 0.5 microgram there was a brief, optimal hypersecretion 
after four hours. Like the fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin, that 
induced by toxin A could be inhibited by chlorpromazine or by depletion of 
intestinal bile. In contrast to cholera toxin, however, toxin A did not activate 
intestinal adenylate cyclase--at least not permanently. Antisera which 
neutralized cholera toxin did not neutralize toxin A, and vice versa.
