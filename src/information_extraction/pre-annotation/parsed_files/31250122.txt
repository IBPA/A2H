PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize the current data 
available on the metabolic effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
including obesity and glucose metabolism in humans.
RECENT FINDINGS: Gut microbiota dysbiosis is a frequent characteristic observed 
in obesity and related metabolic diseases. Pieces of evidence mostly generated 
in mouse models suggest that rescuing this dysbiosis associates with improved 
metabolism. In humans, dietary or bariatric surgery interventions are often 
accompanied by complete or partial restoration of this dysbiosis together with 
weight reduction and metabolic amelioration. FMT is an interesting option to 
modify gut microbiota and has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, 
albeit only used in routine care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, 
there are only limited data on using FMT in the metabolic context. FMT from lean 
donors significantly improves insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with 
metabolic syndrome. However, there is a wide range of clinical responses. 
Interestingly in subjects with high microbial gene richness at baseline and when 
FMT donors that are metabolically compromised are used, no metabolic improvement 
is seen. Moreover, more studies evaluating the effect of FMT in patients with 
overt type 2 diabetes are warranted. Furthermore, interventions (in the receiver 
prior to FMT) aiming to enhance FMT response also need evaluation.
