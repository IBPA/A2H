Cecal filtrates from guinea pigs treated with penicillin contained a toxin which 
produced cytotoxic changes in HeLa cell cultures and was lethal to guinea pigs 
when administered intracecally. The cytotoxicity could be neutralized by 
Clostridium difficile and C. sordellii antitoxins, but not by other clostridial 
antitoxins. Rabbit immunization with toxic cecal extracts produced antibody 
which neutralized the cytotoxicity of guinea pig cecal extracts, of stool 
extracts from humans with antibiotic-associated colitis and of culture 
supernatant fluids of C. difficile. Treatment with vancomycin reduced the number 
of deaths and increased the survival time of penicillin-treated animals. No 
cytotoxin was present in cecal extracts from these guinea pigs. Gram-negative 
bacteremia was present in half the penicillin-treated animals, the sick ones as 
well as the healthy ones. Treatment with vancomycin did not decrease the 
incidence of bacteremia. Gram-negative bacteremia and changes in fecal flora 
were observed in some antibiotic-treated guinea pigs; all diseased animals, 
however, contained this cytotoxin. C. difficile was isolated from cecal contents 
of sick animals and these isolates produced the cytotoxin in vitro. The results 
suggest that C. difficile toxin can cause antibiotic-associated colitis in 
guinea pigs.
