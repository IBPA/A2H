The bZIP transcription factor Nfil3 (also known as E4BP4) is required for the 
development of natural killer (NK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells 
(ILC1s). We find that Nfil3 plays a critical role in the development of other 
mucosal tissue-associated innate lymphocytes. Type 3 ILCs (ILC3s), including 
lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like cells, are severely diminished in both 
numbers and function in Nfil3-deficient mice. Using mixed bone marrow chimeric 
mice, we demonstrate that Nfil3 is critical for normal development of 
gut-associated ILC3s in a cell-intrinsic manner. Furthermore, Nfil3 deficiency 
severely compromises intestinal innate immune defense against acute bacterial 
infection with Citrobacter rodentium and Clostridium difficile. Nfil3 deficiency 
resulted in a loss of the recently identified ILC precursor, yet conditional 
ablation of Nfil3 in the NKp46(+) ILC3 subset did not perturb ILC3 numbers, 
suggesting that Nfil3 is required early during ILC3 development but not for 
lineage maintenance. Lastly, a marked defect in type 2 ILCs (ILC2s) was also 
observed in the lungs and visceral adipose tissue of Nfil3-deficient mice, 
revealing a general requirement for Nfil3 in the development of all ILC 
lineages.
