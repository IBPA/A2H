Clostridium difficile toxins cause acute colitis by disrupting the enterocyte 
barrier and promoting inflammation. ToxB from C. difficile inactivates Rho 
family GTPases and causes release of cytokines and eicosanoids by macrophages. 
We studied the effects of ToxB on GPCR signaling in murine RAW264.7 macrophages 
and found that ToxB elevated Ca(2+) responses to Galphai-linked receptors, 
including the C5aR, but reduced responses to Galphaq-linked receptors, including 
the UDP receptors. Other Rho inhibitors also reduced UDP Ca(2+) responses, but 
they did not affect C5a responses, suggesting that ToxB inhibited UDP responses 
by inhibiting Rho but enhanced C5a responses by other mechanisms. By using 
PLCbeta isoform-deficient BMDM, we found that ToxB inhibited Ca(2+) signaling 
through PLCbeta4 but enhanced signaling through PLCbeta3. Effects of ToxB on 
GPCR Ca(2+) responses correlated with GPCR use of PLCbeta3 versus PLCbeta4. ToxB 
inhibited UDP Ca(2+) signaling without reducing InsP3 production or the 
sensitivity of cellular Ca(2+) stores to exogenous InsP3, suggesting that ToxB 
impairs UDP signaling at the level of InsP3/Ca(2+)coupling. In contrast, ToxB 
elevated InsP3 production by C5a, and the enhancement of Ca(2+) signaling by C5a 
was prevented by inhibition of PLA(2) or 5-LOX but not COX, implicating LTs but 
not prostanoids in the mechanism. In sum, ToxB has opposing, independently 
regulated effects on Ca(2+) signaling by different GPCR-linked PLCbeta isoforms 
in macrophages.
