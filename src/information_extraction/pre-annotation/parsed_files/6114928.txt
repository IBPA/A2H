Antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis has been linked with Clostridium 
difficile toxin. We examined the effect of toxins from four strains of C. 
difficile isolated from patients with pseudomembranous colitis on colonic 
adenylate (EC 4.6.1.1) and guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) activities. Partially 
purified toxins had a cytotoxic effect on hamster fibroblasts in culture at a 
concentration of 10 ng/ml. Likewise, these toxins enhanced colonic guanylate 
cyclase activity two- to threefold, with the maximal stimulation being at 10 
ng/ml. These toxins also enhanced guanylate cyclase activity in ileum, cecum, 
and duodenum. Both the cytotoxic activity on hamster fibroblasts and the 
enhancement of hamster guanylate cyclase activity were inhibited by antiserum to 
C. difficile toxin. These same toxins inhibited adenylate cyclase activity at a 
100-ng/ml concentration, but had no effect at 10 ng/ml. They also had no effect 
at any concentration on colonic Na+-K+ adenosine triphosphatase. To be sure that 
the findings were not due to a contaminant, a purified C. difficile cytotoxin 
was used, and the same findings were found with the pure cytotoxin (at a 
100-fold-lower concentration). The data suggest that activation of guanylate 
cyclase may be a factor in the pathogenesis of antimicrobial-associated 
pseudomembranous colitis.
