Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis result from the actions of bacterial 
exotoxins on the colonic mucosa. This study examined the ability of hyperimmune 
bovine colostral antibodies to neutralize the biological effects of these 
toxins. Anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate was prepared from 
the colostral milk of Holstein cows previously immunized with C. difficile 
toxoids. The anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin concentrate contained high 
levels of bovine immunoglobulin G specific for C. difficile toxins A and B, as 
evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-C. difficile bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate neutralized the cytotoxic effects of purified toxin A 
and toxin B on cultured human fibroblasts, whereas control bovine immunoglobulin 
concentrate had little toxin-neutralizing activity. Anti-C. difficile bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate also blocked the binding of toxin A to its enterocyte 
receptor and inhibited the enterotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins on the rat 
ileum, as measured by an increased rat ileal loop weight/length ratio (63% 
inhibition; P < 0.01), increased mannitol permeability (92% inhibition; P < 
0.01), and histologic grading of enteritis (P < 0.01 versus nonimmune bovine 
immunoglobulin concentrate). Thus, anti-C. difficile bovine immunoglobulin 
concentrate neutralizes the cytotoxic effects of C. difficile toxins in vitro 
and inhibits their enterotoxic effects in vivo. This agent may be clinically 
useful in the prevention and treatment of C. difficile diarrhea and colitis.
