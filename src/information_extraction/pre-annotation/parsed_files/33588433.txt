Co-administration of human secretory IgA (sIgA) together with subtherapeutic 
vancomycin significantly enhanced survival in the Clostridioides difficile 
infection (CDI) hamster model . Vancomycin (5 or 10 mg/kgx5 days) + healthy 
donor plasma sIgA/monomeric IgA (TIDx21 days) or hyperimmune sIgA/monomeric IgA 
(BIDx13 days) enhanced survival of CDI hamsters. Survival curves were 
significantly improved compared to vancomycin alone (p=0.018 and 0.039 by 
log-rank (Mantel-Cox) for healthy, and hyperimmune, sIgA, respectively. Passive 
immunization with sIgA made with recombinant human secretory component and IgA 
dimer/polymer from pooled human plasma can be administered orally, and prevents 
lethal infection in a partially treated CDI hamster model.
