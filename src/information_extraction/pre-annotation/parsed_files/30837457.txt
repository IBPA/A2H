Microbes form complex communities that perform critical roles for the integrity 
of their environment or the well-being of their hosts. Controlling these 
microbial communities can help us restore natural ecosystems and maintain 
healthy human microbiota. However, the lack of an efficient and systematic 
control framework has limited our ability to manipulate these microbial 
communities. Here we fill this gap by developing a control framework based on 
the new notion of structural accessibility. Our framework uses the ecological 
network of the community to identify minimum sets of its driver species, 
manipulation of which allows controlling the whole community. We numerically 
validate our control framework on large communities, and then we demonstrate its 
application for controlling the gut microbiota of gnotobiotic mice infected with 
Clostridium difficile and the core microbiota of the sea sponge Ircinia oros. 
Our results provide a systematic pipeline to efficiently drive complex microbial 
communities towards desired states.
