BACKGROUND & AIMS: The pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile toxin A-induced 
intestinal inflammation is not completely understood. The aim of this study was 
to define the contribution of mast cells to the fluid secretion and neutrophil 
infiltration associated with toxin A-induced enteritis.
METHODS: Fluid secretion and neutrophil infiltration in toxin A- or 
buffer-challenged ileal loops were assessed in normal, mast cell-deficient, and 
mast cell-deficient KitW/KitW-v mice that had undergone selective repair of 
their mast cell deficiency. The effect of a specific substance P-receptor 
antagonist was also studied.
RESULTS: Intestinal fluid secretion and neutrophil recruitment were 
significantly diminished in mast cell-deficient KitW/KitW-v and mast 
cell-deficient MgfSl/MgfSl-d mice compared with the respective normal mice. Mast 
cell-reconstituted KitW/KitW-v mice showed responses similar to the normal 
congenic mice. Administration of a specific substance P-receptor antagonist 
(CP-96,345) reduced toxin A-induced intestinal fluid secretion and inhibited 
neutrophil infiltration in normal, mast cell-deficient KitW/KitW-v, and mast 
cell-reconstituted KitW/KitW-v mice.
CONCLUSIONS: C. difficile toxin A elicits intestinal fluid secretion and 
neutrophil infiltration by both mast cell-dependent and -independent pathways, 
and substance P participates in both pathways.
