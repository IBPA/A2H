Inactivation of Rho GTPases inhibited the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. The 
role of Cdc42 in neurite outgrowth was then studied by selective inhibition of 
Cdc42 signals. Overexpression of ACK42, Cdc42 binding domain of ACK-1, inhibited 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. ACK42 also inhibited the neurite 
outgrowth of PC12 cells induced by constitutively activated mutant of Cdc42, but 
not Rac. These results suggest that Cdc42 plays an important role in mediating 
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth was 
also demonstrated using a cell permeable chimeric protein, penetratin-ACK42. A 
dominant negative mutant of Rac, RacN17 inhibited Cdc42-induced neurite 
outgrowth of PC12 cells suggesting that Rac acts downstream of Cdc42. Further 
studies, using primary-cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons, showed that 
Cdc42 is also involved in the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar granule neurons. 
Both penetratin-ACK42 and Clostridium difficile toxin B, which inactivates all 
members of Rho GTPases strongly inhibited the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar 
granule neurons. These results show that Cdc42 plays a similar and essential 
role in the development of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and cerebellar 
granule neurons. These results provide evidence that Cdc42 produces signals that 
are essential for the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and cerebellar granule 
neurons.
