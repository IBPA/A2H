An antibacterial substance appeared within 1 day in feces of gnotobiotic rats 
harboring a human intestinal Peptostreptococcus strain. It disappeared when the 
rat bile-pancreatic duct was ligatured or when the rats ingested a trypsin 
inhibitor. Anaerobic cultures of the Peptostreptococcus strain in a medium 
supplemented with trypsin also exhibited an antibacterial activity, which was 
also inhibited by the trypsin inhibitor. In vitro the antibacterial substance 
from both feces and culture medium was active against several gram-positive 
bacteria, including other Peptostreptococcus spp., potentially pathogenic 
Clostridium spp. such as C. perfringens, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. 
septicum, and C. sordellii, Eubacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus 
spp. Whatever the order of inoculation of the strains, a sensitive strain of C. 
perfringens was eliminated within 1 day from the intestine of rats 
monoassociated with the Peptostreptococcus strain. These findings demonstrate 
for the first time that very potent antibacterial substances can be produced 
through a mechanism involving intestinal bacteria and exocrine pancreatic 
secretions.
