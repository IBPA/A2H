Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhoea 
worldwide, and if the bacterium is not cleared effectively it can pose a risk of 
recurrent infections and complications such as colitis, sepsis and death. In 
this study we demonstrate that surface layer proteins from the one of the most 
frequently acquired strains of C. difficile, activate mechanisms in murine 
macrophage in vitro that are associated with clearance of bacterial infection. 
Surface layer proteins (SLPs) isolated from C. difficile induced the production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased macrophage migration 
and phagocytotic activity in vitro. Furthermore, we also observed up-regulation 
of a number of cell surface markers on the macrophage, which are important in 
pathogen recognition and antigen presentation. The effects of SLPs on 
macrophages were reversed in the presence of a p38 inhibitor, indicating the 
potential importance of this signalling protein in how SLP activates the immune 
system. In conclusion this study shows that surface layer proteins from a common 
strain of C. difficile can activate a clearance response in macrophage and 
suggests that these proteins are important in clearance of C. difficile 
infection. Understanding how the immune system clears C. difficile infection 
could offer important insights for new treatment strategies.
