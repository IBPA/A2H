The action of highly purified Clostridium difficile toxin A was studied in the 
jejunum of rats in vivo. C. difficile toxin A reversed dose-dependently net 
fluid absorption into net fluid secretion, accompanied by an increase in 
prostaglandin E2 but not 5-hydroxytryptamine output into the gut lumen. 
Accordingly, indomethacin but not the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists 
ketanserin plus tropisetron were able to inhibit toxin A-induced fluid 
secretion. Atropine and hexamethonium were without effect on the action of toxin 
A, such excluding a nervous mechanism. The cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and 
cyclic GMP appear not to be involved in the mediation of the secretory response. 
The reduced cyclic GMP levels are most likely the result of a complete 
destruction of the villus membranes, where the guanylate cyclase is located. 
Histological studies revealed massive damage to intestinal villi, whereas the 
majority of the crypts seem to be unaffected. In conclusion, toxin A-induced 
intestinal fluid secretion appears to be caused mainly by severe mucosal damage. 
PGE2-release may be the consequence of the inflammation accompanying this 
damage. The mechanism seems to be completely different to those of cholera toxin 
or Escherichia coli heat stable enterotoxin.
