The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and associated mortality 
have increased rapidly worldwide in recent years. Therefore, it is critical to 
develop new therapies for CDI. In this study, we generated a novel, potently 
neutralizing, tetravalent, and bispecific antibody composed of 2 
heavy-chain-only VH (VHH) binding domains against both TcdA and TcdB (designated 
"ABA") that reverses fulminant CDI in mice infected with an epidemic 027 strain 
after a single injection of the antibody. We demonstrated that ABA bound to both 
toxins simultaneously and displayed a significantly enhanced neutralizing 
activity both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, ABA was able to broadly 
neutralize toxins from clinical C. difficile isolates that express both TcdA and 
TcdB but failed to neutralize the toxin from TcdA(-)TcdB(+) C. difficile 
strains. This study thus provides a rationale for the development of multivalent 
VHHs that target both toxins and are broadly neutralizing for treating severe 
CDI.
