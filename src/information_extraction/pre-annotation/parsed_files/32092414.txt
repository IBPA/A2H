Clostridioides difficile strains were isolated from manure and digestate samples 
from five biogas plants in France. The objective of this study was to 
characterize these isolates using PCR ribotyping, wgMLST, a multiplex PCR 
targeting genes encoding for the main virulence factors, i.e. tcdA, tcdB, cdtA 
and cdtB, and antimicrobial susceptibility assays. The 54 strains characterized 
were all positive for tcdA and tcdB and 83% (45/54) were positive for the binary 
toxin genes. PCR ribotypes 126 (59%) and 078 (37%) were predominant, and wgMLST 
analysis of 18 isolates showed close proximity of strains within a single biogas 
plant. Samples from the biogas plant supplied with cattle and poultry manure 
displayed the largest variety in PCR ribotypes. The in vitro activities of nine 
antimicrobial agents were determined. All the strains were susceptible to 
vancomycin and metronidazole, which are currently considered first-line 
treatments for C. difficile infection in humans. All the strains were resistant 
to clindamycin. The results of this study show that a high percentage of 
C. difficile strains present in the French biogas plants investigated are 
toxigenic strains from PCR ribotypes also commonly found in humans.
