Lifeway(Â®) kefir, a fermented milk product containing 12 probiotic organisms, is 
reported to show promise as an alternative to fecal microbiota transplantation 
for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We employed a murine CDI 
model to study the probiotic protective mechanisms and unexpectedly determined 
that kefir drastically increased disease severity. Our results emphasize the 
need for further independent clinical testing of kefir as alternative therapy in 
recurrent CDI.
