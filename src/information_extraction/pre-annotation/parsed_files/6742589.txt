The cecal content of a healthy young hare (a 10-fold dilution prepared in 
anaerobiosis) was transferred into gnotobiotic recipient mice. The fecal flora 
of recipient mice was inoculated into 49 conventional young hares (kept in a 
closed building) immediately after birth. All the inoculated hares survived 
until weaning whereas 35% of 48 non-treated conventional hares died of diarrhea. 
Clostridium difficile and C perfringens were present in all the diarrheal 
noninoculated hares, whereas these species were present only in 50% of healthy 
inoculated or noninoculated hares at low concentrations (less than 10(6)/g of 
feces). A microbial barrier effect against challenge-exposure strains of C 
difficile and C perfringens was evidenced in the intestinal tract of recipient 
gnotobiotic mice and young hares. Seemingly, the protective effect of the 
microbial inoculum was due to antagonisms exerted against C difficile and C 
perfringens in the intestinal tract of inoculated conventional hares.
