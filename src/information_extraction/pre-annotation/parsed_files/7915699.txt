BACKGROUND/AIMS: Activation of intestinal mast cells and neurons is involved in 
intestinal inflammation and diarrhea. This study compared the effects of 
neuronal inhibitors and inhibition of intestinal sensory afferent nerves on the 
intestinal actions of Clostridium difficile toxin A, an inflammatory 
enterotoxin, and cholera toxin, a noninflammatory enterotoxin.
METHODS: The effects of lidocaine, hexamethonium, atropine, and long-term 
pretreatment of capsaicin on fluid secretion, mannitol permeability, 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and release of rat mast cell protease II 
(RMCPII) were measured in toxin A- and cholera toxin-exposed loops in vivo.
RESULTS: Lidocaine, hexamethonium, and capsaicin, but not atropine, inhibited 
toxin A-mediated secretion and MPO activity, but only capsaicin reduced mannitol 
permeability. Lidocaine, but not capsaicin, reduced secretion and permeability 
caused by cholera toxin. Toxin A caused release of RMCPII from rat ileum in vivo 
and in vitro; this was inhibited by lidocaine or capsaicin, whereas cholera 
toxin had no effect on release of RMCPII.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal mechanisms are important in the in vivo effects of these 
two enterotoxins. Capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferent neurons and mast cells 
are involved in the intestinal mechanism of toxin A, but not cholera toxin.
