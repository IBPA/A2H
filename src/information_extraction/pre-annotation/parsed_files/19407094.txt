A 14-year-old Quarter Horse with a 48-hr history of colic was euthanized after 
failure to respond to treatment. At necropsy, cecal and colonic mucosae were 
congested throughout, and there was segmental edema and significant thickening 
of the intestinal wall. Excessive numbers of mononuclear cells were found in 
mucosal lamina propria. Submucosal hemorrhage was diffuse and extensive, and 
Clostridium difficile toxins A and B were detected. Large numbers of C. 
difficile were isolated, and genetic characterization revealed them to be North 
American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1, polymerase chain reaction 
ribotype 027, and toxinotype III. Genes for the binary toxin were present, and 
toxin negative-regulator tcdC contained an 18-bp deletion. This genotype 
comprises the current human "epidemic strain," which is associated with human C. 
difficile-associated disease of greater than historical severity. The diagnosis 
was peracute typhlocolitis, with lesions and history typical of those attributed 
to colitis X.
