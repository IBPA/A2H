Mechanisms mediating adult enteric neurogenesis are largely unknown. Using 
inflammation-associated neurogenesis models and a transgenic approach, we aimed 
to understand the cell-source for new neurons in infectious and inflammatory 
colitis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and Citrobacter rodentium colitis (CC) was 
induced in adult mice and colonic neurons were quantified. Sox2GFP and PLP1GFP 
mice confirmed the cell-type specificity of these markers. Sox2CreER:YFP and 
PLP1creER:tdT mice were used to determine the fate of these cells after colitis. 
Sox2 expression was investigated in colonic neurons of human patients with 
Clostridium difficile or ulcerative colitis. Both DSS and CC led to increased 
colonic neurons. Following colitis in adult Sox2CreER:YFP mice, YFP initially 
expressed predominantly by glia becomes expressed by neurons following colitis, 
without observable DNA replication. Similarly in PLP1CreER:tdT mice, PLP1 cells 
that co-express S100b but not RET also give rise to neurons following colitis. 
In human colitis, Sox2-expressing neurons increase from 1-2% to an average 14% 
in colitis. The new neurons predominantly express calretinin, thus appear to be 
excitatory. These results suggest that colitis promotes rapid enteric 
neurogenesis in adult mice and humans through differentiation of Sox2- and 
PLP1-expressing cells, which represent enteric glia and/or neural progenitors. 
Further defining neurogenesis will improve understanding and treatment of 
injury-associated intestinal motility/sensory disorders.
