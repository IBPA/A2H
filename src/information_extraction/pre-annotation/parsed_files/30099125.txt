BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality associated with Clostridioides (formerly 
Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) rises progressively with advanced age 
(≥65 years) due in part to perturbations of the gut microbiota and immune 
dysfunction. Epidemiological data of community-acquired CDI suggests increased 
susceptibility may begin earlier during middle-age (45-64 years) but the 
causation remains unknown.
METHODS: Middle-aged (12-14 months) and young (2-4 months) adult mice were 
infected with C. difficile, and disease severity, gut microbiome and innate 
immune response were compared. Cytokine reconstitution studies were performed in 
infected middle-aged mice.
RESULTS: Infection of middle-aged mice with C. difficile led to greater disease 
compared to young controls, which was associated with increases in C. difficile 
burden and toxin titers, and elevated bacterial translocation. With the 
exception of an expansion of C. difficile in middle-aged mice, microbiome 
analysis revealed no age-related differences. In contrast, middle-aged mice 
displayed a significant defect in neutrophil recruitment to the colon, with 
diminished levels of innate immune cytokines IL-6, IL-23 and IL-22. Importantly, 
recombinant IL-22 administration during CDI reduced morbidity and prevented 
death in middle-aged mice.
CONCLUSION: Increased susceptibility to C. difficile occurs in middle-aged mice 
modeling the community-acquired CDI demographics and is driven by an impaired 
innate immune response.
