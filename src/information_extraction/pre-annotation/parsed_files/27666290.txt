The present study was aimed at evaluating the fluorescence property, sporicidal 
potency against Bacillus and Clostridium endospores, and surface disinfecting 
ability of biogenic nano silver. The nano silver was synthesized using an 
actinobacterial cell-filtrate. The fluorescence property as well as imaging 
facilitator potency of this nano silver was verified adopting spectrofluorometer 
along with fluorescent and confocal laser scanning microscope wherein strong 
emission and bright green fluorescence, respectively, on the entire spore 
surface was observed. Subsequently, the endospores of B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. 
amyloliquefaciens, C. perfringens and C. difficile were treated with physical 
sporicides, chemical sporicides and nano silver, in which the nano silver 
brought about pronounced inhibition even at a very low concentration. Finally, 
the environmental surface-sanitizing potency of nano silver was investigated 
adopting cage co-contamination assay, wherein vital organs of mice exposed to 
the nano silver-treated cage did not show any signs of pathological lesions, 
thus signifying the ability of nano silver to completely disinfect the spore or 
reduce the count required for infection. Taken these observations together, we 
have shown the multi-functional biological properties of the nano silver, 
synthesized using an actinobacterial cell-filtrate, which could be of 
application in advanced diagnostics, biomedical engineering and therapeutics in 
the near future.
