Lethal toxin of Clostridium sordellii (MLD 150 ng/kg) is one of the most potent 
Clostridial toxins and is responsible for most of the diseases including sudden 
death syndrome in cattle, sheep and toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing faciitis, 
neonatal omphalitis and gangrene in humans. Lethal toxin (TcsL) is a single 
chain protein of about 270 kDa. In the present study, 1.6 kb DNA fragment 
encoding for the catalytic domain of TcsL was PCR amplified, cloned in pQE30 UA 
vector and expressed in E. coli SG 13009. The expression of recombinant lethal 
toxin protein (rTcsL) was optimized and it was purified under native conditions 
using a single step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant 
protein was used for the production of polyclonal antibodies in mice and rabbit. 
The raised antibodies reacted specifically with the purified rTcsL and intact 
native lethal toxin on Western blot. The biological activity of the recombinant 
protein was tested in HeLa cells where it showed the cytotoxicity. Further, the 
polyclonal antibodies were used for in-vitro neutralization of purified rTcsL, 
acid precipitated C. sordellii and C. difficile native toxins in HeLa cells. 
Mice and rabbit anti-rTcsL sera effectively neutralized the cytotoxicity of 
rTcsL and C. sordellii native toxin but it did not neutralize the cytotoxicity 
of C. difficile toxin in HeLa cells.
