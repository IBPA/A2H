The fraction of administered antibiotics that reach the cecum and colon causes 
dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, resulting in various diseases. Protection of 
the gut microbiome from antibiotics using antibiotic adsorbents in the cecum and 
colon is a promising method to overcome this issue. Previously, activated 
charcoal (AC) has been reported to protect the gut microbiome of host animals. 
AC is an adsorbent that is widely used to capture toxic compounds and overdosed 
drugs in the gastrointestinal tract. The specificity of adsorbents for 
antibiotics is critical to avoid the risk of unexpected side effects caused by 
nonspecific adsorption of biological compounds in the intestinal fluid, such as 
bile acids and essential micronutrients. Here, we have developed specific 
adsorbents for vancomycin (VCM), which is known to cause gut dysbiosis. The 
adsorbents were composed of polyethyleneglycol-based microparticles (MPs) in 
which a specific ligand for VCM, D-Ala-D-Ala-OH, was attached via dendrons of 
D-lysine to raise the content of the ligand in the MPs. The MPs successfully 
protected Staphylococcus lentus from VCM in vitro because of the adsorption of 
VCM in the culture media. Pre-administration of MPs to mice reduced the amount 
of free VCM in the feces to an undetectable level. This treatment minimized the 
effect of VCM on gut microbiota and provided protection against Clostridioides 
difficile infection after oral challenge with spores.
