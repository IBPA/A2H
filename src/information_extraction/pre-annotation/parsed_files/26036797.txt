Clostridium difficile is the major cause of hospital-acquired infectious 
diarrhea and colitis in developed countries. The pathogenicity of C. difficile 
is mainly mediated by the release of 2 large potent exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) 
and toxin B (TcdB), both of which require neutralization to prevent disease 
occurrence. We have generated a novel chimeric protein, designated mTcd138, 
comprised of the glucosyltransferase and cysteine proteinase domains of TcdB and 
the receptor binding domain of TcdA and expressed it in Bacillus megaterium. To 
ensure that mTcd138 is atoxic, 2 point mutations were introduced to the 
glucosyltransferase domain of TcdB, which essentially eliminates toxicity of 
mTcd138. Parenteral immunizations of mice and hamsters with mTcd138 induced 
protective antibodies to both toxins and provided protection against infection 
with the hyper-virulent C. difficile strain UK6.
