Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of worldwide 
antibiotics-associated diarrhea. In this study, we report the construction and 
evaluation of a novel bacteriophage lysin-human defensin fusion protein 
targeting C. difficile. The fusion protein, designated LHD, is composed of two 
parts connected by a 3-repeating unit linker "(GGGGS)3": the catalytic domain of 
a lysin protein from a C. difficile bacteriophage phiC2 (LCD), and the 
functional domain of a human defensin protein HD5. Lytic assays showed that LHD 
protein had a potent lytic activity against different types of clinical C. 
difficile strains, including the epidemic 027, 078, 012, and 087 strains. The 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of LHD was 0.78 μg/ml, which was lower 
than the MIC of the protein LCD (1.56 μg/ml), and the MICs of metronidazole (4 
μg/ml) and vancomycin (4 μg/ml). In addition, the LHD protein could lyse C. 
different strains in different pHs (6.0, 7.0, and 8.0). Evaluation of LHD 
potency in vivo using mouse model of C. difficile infection (CDI) showed that 
administration of the LHD protein (twice daily for 7 days) was effective in 
mitigating the symptoms and reducing the death from CDI. Treatment with LHD also 
significantly decreased the number of C. difficile spores and the toxin level in 
feces from the infected mice. Our data suggest that this novel lysin-human 
defensin fusion protein has a potential on CDI control.
