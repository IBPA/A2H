BACKGROUND & AIMS: Goblet cells secrete a combination of trefoil peptides and 
mucin glycoproteins to form a continuous gel on the mucosal surface. The 
functional effects of these products remain uncertain.
METHODS: Trefoil peptides and/or mucin glycoproteins were added to Transwell 
monolayers of the human colonic cancer-derived T84 cell line. Intact monolayers 
permitted penetration of < 4% of the inert marker [3H]mannitol at 4 hours. 
Exposure to the toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin (1 mg/mL), oleic acid (8 mmol/L) 
and taurocholic acid (12 mmol/L), or Clostridium difficile toxin A (0.7 
microgram/mL) resulted in loss of barrier function with 36%, 62%, and 45% of 
[3H]mannitol penetration, respectively.
RESULTS: Addition of recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor in 
physiological concentrations (1-5 micrograms/microL) resulted in attenuation of 
the damage to monolayer integrity by up to 52%. Protection was enhanced (up to 
95%) by the copresence of human colonic mucin glycoproteins. Similar effects 
were observed when rat intestinal trefoil factor or human spasmolysin, another 
human trefoil peptide, were added alone or in the presence of human mucin 
glycoproteins. Conversely, mucin glycoproteins isolated from the rat colon or 
stomach facilitated protection when added with human spasmolysin or human 
intestinal trefoil factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Trefoil peptides and mucin glycoproteins protect gastrointestinal 
mucosa from a variety of insults.
