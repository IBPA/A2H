The Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium difficile is the major cause of 
nosocomial diarrhea; manifestations of infection include diarrhea, 
pseudomembranous colitis, and death. Genes for type IV pili, a bacterial 
nanofiber often involved in colonization and until relatively recently described 
only in Gram-negatives, are present in all members of the Clostridiales. We 
hypothesized that any pilins encoded in the C. difficile genome would be 
immunogenic, as has been shown with pilins from Gram-negative organisms. We 
describe nine pilin or pilin-like protein genes, for which we introduce a 
coherent nomenclature, in the C. difficile R20291 genome. The nine predicted 
pilin or pilin-like proteins have relatively conserved N-terminal hydrophobic 
regions, but diverge at their C-termini. Analysis of synonymous and 
nonsynonymous substitutions revealed evidence of diversifying selective pressure 
in two pilin genes. Six of the nine identified proteins were purified and used 
to immunize mice. Immunization of mice with each individual protein generated 
antibody responses that varied in titer and cross-reactivity, a notable result 
given the low amino acid sequence identity among the pilins. Further studies in 
other small mammals mirrored our results in mice. Our results illuminate 
components of the C. difficile type IV pilus and help identify targets for an 
anti-C. difficile vaccine.
