Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are an urgent public health threat 
worldwide and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in healthcare 
settings. The increasing incidence and severity of infections combined with the 
scarcity of effective anti-CDI agents has made treatment of CDI very 
challenging. Therefore, development of new, effective anticlostridial agents 
remains a high priority. The current study investigated the in vivo efficacy of 
auranofin in a CDI hamster model. All hamsters treated with auranofin (5 mg/kg) 
survived a lethal challenge with C. difficile. Furthermore, auranofin (5 mg/kg) 
was as effective as vancomycin, the drug of choice for treatment of CDIs, 
against relapsing CDI. Furthermore, auranofin (5 mg/kg) generated a 3.15-log10 
reduction (99.97%) in C. difficile count in the cecal contents of hamsters. 
These results indicate that auranofin warrants further investigation as a new 
agent to replenish the pipeline of anti-CDI therapeutics.
