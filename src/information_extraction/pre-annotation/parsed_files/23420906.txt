BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The infective form of C. difficile is the spore, 
but the vegetative bacterium causes the disease. Because C. difficile spore 
germination is required for symptomatic infection, antigermination approaches 
could lead to the prevention of CDI. We recently reported that CamSA, a bile 
salt analog, inhibits C. difficile spore germination in vitro.
METHODS: Mice infected with massive inocula of C. difficile spores were treated 
with different concentrations of CamSA and monitored for CDI signs. C. difficile 
spore and vegetative cells were counted in feces from infected mice.
RESULTS: A single 50-mg/kg dose of CamSA prevented CDI in mice without any 
observable toxicity. Lower CamSA doses resulted in delayed CDI onset and less 
severe signs of disease. Ingested C. difficile spores were quantitatively 
recovered from feces of CamSA-protected mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a mechanism whereby the antigermination effect 
of CamSA is responsible for preventing CDI signs. This approach represents a new 
paradigm in CDI treatment. Instead of further compromising the microbiota of CDI 
patients with strong antibiotics, antigermination therapy could serve as a 
microbiota surrogate to curtail C. difficile colonization of antibiotic-treated 
patients.
