The flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch is an emerging target for the 
development of novel RNA-targeting antibiotics. We previously discovered an FMN 
derivative, 5FDQD, that protects mice against diarrhea-causing Clostridium 
difficile bacteria. Here, we present the structure-based drug design strategy 
that led to the discovery of this fluoro-phenyl derivative with antibacterial 
properties. This approach involved the following stages: (1) structural analysis 
of all available free and bound FMN riboswitch structures; (2) design, 
synthesis, and purification of derivatives; (3) in vitro testing for productive 
binding using two chemical probing methods; (4) in vitro transcription 
termination assays; and (5) resolution of the crystal structures of the FMN 
riboswitch in complex with the most mature candidates. In the process, we 
delineated principles for productive binding to this riboswitch, thereby 
demonstrating the effectiveness of a coordinated structure-guided approach to 
designing drugs against RNA.
