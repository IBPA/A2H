Clostridium difficile toxin A causes severe intestinal inflammation and fluid 
secretion in rabbit ileum and is chemotactic for neutrophils in vitro. The 
mechanism of intestinal injury produced by toxin A appears to involve direct 
epithelial cell damage as well as recruitment of an inflammatory cell response. 
The current study was undertaken to determine if toxin A can directly stimulate 
a proliferative response in lymphocytes. Highly purified toxin A, in the 
presence of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, stimulated substantial 
[3H]thymidine incorporation by murine splenic lymphocytes, which was maximal at 
10(-9) M toxin A and 800 ng/ml ionomycin. Removal of T cells with anti-Thy-1.2 
antibody plus complement had no effect on the proliferative response induced by 
toxin A. However, [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to toxin A was 
significantly inhibited (P less than 0.001) by the removal of macrophages from 
splenocyte suspensions and was restored by the addition of peritoneal 
macrophages or cell-free supernatant from toxin A-treated macrophage cultures. 
Analysis of the toxin A-treated macrophage supernatants showed high levels of 
IL-1, but not IL-2 or IL-4. The combination of recombinant IL-1 plus ionomycin 
was found to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation by T cell-depleted splenic 
lymphocytes. These results suggest that toxin A stimulates the release of IL-1, 
and possibly other factors, from macrophages which can costimulate murine B 
lymphocytes.
