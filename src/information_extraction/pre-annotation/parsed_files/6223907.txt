Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar 
to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and 
Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and 
Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal 
strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. 
epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active 
than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant 
strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to 
teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing 
cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal 
for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous 
administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing 
experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values 
less than 1 mg/kg).
