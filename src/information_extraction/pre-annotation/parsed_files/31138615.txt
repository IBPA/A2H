Clostridium difficile disease is mediated primarily by toxins A and B (TcdA and 
TcdB, respectively). The receptor binding domains (RBD) of TcdA and TcdB are 
immunogenic, and anti-RBD antibodies are protective. Since these toxins act 
locally, an optimal C. difficile vaccine would generate both systemic and 
mucosal responses. We have repurposed an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium strain (YS1646) to produce such a vaccine. Plasmid-based candidates 
expressing either the TcdA or TcdB RBD were screened. Different vaccine routes 
and schedules were tested to achieve detectable serum and mucosal antibody 
titers in C57BL/6J mice. When given in a multimodality schedule over 1â€‰week 
(intramuscularly and orally [p.o.] on day 0 and p.o. on days 2 and 4), several 
candidates provided 100% protection against lethal challenge. Substantial 
protection (82%) was achieved with combined p.o. TcdA and TcdB vaccination alone 
(days 0, 2, and 4). These data demonstrate the potential of the YS1646-based 
vaccines for C. difficile and strongly support their further development.
