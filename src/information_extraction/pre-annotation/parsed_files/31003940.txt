Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the number one hospital-acquired 
infection in the United States. CDI is more common and severe in inflammatory 
bowel disease patients. Here, we studied the mechanism by which prior colitis 
exacerbates CDI. Mice were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, recovered 
for 2 weeks, and then were infected with C. difficile. Mortality and CDI 
severity were increased in DSS-treated mice compared to controls. Severe CDI is 
dependent on CD4+ T cells, which persist after colitis-associated inflammation 
subsides. Adoptive transfer of Th17 cells to naive mice is sufficient to 
increase CDI-associated mortality through elevated IL-17 production. Finally, in 
humans, the Th17 cytokines IL-6 and IL-23 associate with severe CDI, and 
patients with high serum IL-6 are 7.6 times more likely to die post infection. 
These findings establish a central role for Th17 cells in CDI pathogenesis 
following colitis and identify them as a potential target for preventing severe 
disease.
