BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome (GMB) generates numerous chemicals that are 
absorbed systemically and excreted in urine. Antibiotics can disrupt the GMB 
ecosystem and weaken its resistance to colonization by enteric pathogens such as 
Clostridium difficile. If the changes in GMB composition and metabolism are 
sufficiently large, they can be reflected in the urinary metabo-lome. 
Characterizing these changes could provide a potentially valuable biomarker of 
the status of the GMB. While preliminary studies suggest such a possibility, the 
high level of data variance presents a challenge to translational applications. 
Since many GMB-generated chemicals are derived from the biotransformation of 
plant-derived dietary polyphenols, administering an oral precursor challenge 
should amplify GMB-dependent changes in urinary metabolites.
METHODS: A course of antibiotics (clindamycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or 
aztreonam) was administered SC daily (days 1 and 2) to mice receiving 
polyphenol-rich green tea in drinking water. Urine was collected at baseline as 
well as days 3, 7, and 11. Levels of pyrogallol and pyrocatechol, two phenolic 
molecules unequivocally GMB-dependent in humans but that had not been similarly 
examined in mice, were quantified.
RESULTS: In confirmation of our hypothesis, differential changes in murine 
urinary pyrogallol levels identified the treatments (clindamycin, 
piperacillin/tazobactam) previously associated with a weakening of colonization 
resistance to Clostridium difficile. The changes in pyrocatechol levels did not 
withstand corrections for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: In the mouse, urinary pyrogallol and, in all likelihood, 
pyrocatechol levels, are GMB-dependent and, in combination with precursor 
challenge, deserve further consideration as potential metabolomic biomarkers for 
the health and dysbiotic vulnerability of the GMB.
