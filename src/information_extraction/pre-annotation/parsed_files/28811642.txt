Clinical management of Clostridium difficile infection is still far from 
satisfactory as bacterial spores are resistant to many chemical agents and 
physical treatments. Certain types of nanoparticles have been demonstrated to 
exhibit anti-microbial efficacy even in multi-drug resistance bacteria. However, 
most of these studies failed to show biocompatibility to the mammalian host 
cells and no study has revealed in vivo efficacy in C. difficile infection 
animal models. The spores treated with 500 µg/mL Fe3-δO4 nanoparticles for 
20 minutes, 64% of the spores were inhibited from transforming into vegetative 
cells, which was close to the results of the sodium hypochlorite-treated 
positive control. By cryo-electron micro-tomography, we demonstrated that 
Fe3-δO4 nanoparticles bind on spore surfaces and reduce the dipicolinic acid 
(DPA) released by the spores. In a C. difficile infection animal model, the 
inflammatory level triple decreased in mice with colonic C. difficile spores 
treated with Fe3-δO4 nanoparticles. Histopathological analysis showed a 
decreased intense neutrophil accumulation in the colon tissue of the Fe3-δO4 
nanoparticle-treated mice. Fe3-δO4 nanoparticles, which had no influence on gut 
microbiota and apparent side effects in vivo, were efficacious inhibitors of C. 
difficile spore germination by attacking its surface and might become clinically 
feasible for prophylaxis and therapy.
