In an attempt to understand more completely why patients treated with 
phenothiazines (chlorpromazine and cyamemazine), methotrexate, and certain 
antibiotics such as clindamycin have an increased risk of developing 
pseudomembranous colitis, the production of toxins A and B by Clostridium 
difficile in the presence of these drugs was measured in vitro as well as in 
vivo by using axenic mice. None of the drugs tested increased the production of 
toxins either in vitro or in vivo.
