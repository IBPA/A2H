Do hamsters, like rats, rabbits and mice, possess an hepatocyte 'IgA pump' 
whereby circulating plasma polymeric IgA (pIgA) is actively transported into 
bile, against a concentration gradient, via the polymeric Ig receptor or 
secretory component (SC)? Precipitating antisera, raised against rat Igs and 
serum proteins, and crossreacting with their hamster homologues, detected 
hamster SC by immunoelectrophoresis in bile, but not serum. Gel filtration of 
hamster bile indicated that free SC eluted between IgG and albumin, as for other 
mammals. Hamster bile IgA was pIgA, and was true secretory IgA (SIgA) by its 
reaction with anti-SC antiserum and by SDS-PAGE with reduction. Hamster serum 
IgA comprised both pIgA and IgA monomers. Mean bile-to-serum concentration 
ratios (B/S) for IgA, IgG, transferrin and albumin, measured by radial 
immunodiffusion, were 2.65, 0.019, 0.024, and 0.016, respectively, demonstrating 
strongly selective enrichment of bile in IgA. Human 125I-labelled dimeric IgA 
was injected into the circulation of five hamsters with cannulated bile ducts; 
20% of the [125I]IgA (> 95% precipitable by trichloroacetic acid) was recovered 
in bile within 5 h, a figure close to that for mice, but smaller than that for 
rats and rabbits. The data suggest that bile significantly contributes to 
hamster intestinal SIgA, as shown for rats, rabbits and mice. This could be 
relevant to studies where hamsters are used as an experimental model for 
infection by the human intestinal pathogen, Clostridium difficile.
