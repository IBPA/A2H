AIM: To prepare monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Clostridium difficile toxin 
A and identify their properties.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were immunized with C.difficile toxin A. The splenocytes 
from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells Sp2/0. The hybridoma cells 
were screened by indirect ELISA and limiting dilution method. The titer and 
relative affinity of ascitic mAbs were determined by ELISA. Specificity of mAbs 
was analyzed by Western blot.
RESULTS: Six hybridoma cell lines (2H7, 3E9, 4B5, 5C10, 6G8 and 8A1) secreting 
mAbs against C.difficile toxin A were obtained. The Ig classes and subclasses of 
mAbs 2H7, 3E9 and 6G8 were IgM, mAbs 4B5 and 8A1 were IgG1, and mAb 5C10 was 
IgG2a. All 6 mAbs had no neutralization activity. Epitope recognized by 5 
mAbs(2H7, 4B5, 5C10, 6G8 and 8A1) differed from that by mAb 3E9. Relative 
affinities of mAbs 8A1 and 4B5 were all above 10(5), and those of other 4 mAbs 
were 10(4). Western blot analysis no-denatured PAGE showed that all 6 mAbs 
reacted to C.difficile toxin A with M(r) being 55 x 10(4), and under the 
condition of denatured SDS-PAGE, Western blot analysis showed that all 6 mAbs 
reacted to subunits of C.difficile toxin A with M(r) being 5 x 10(4)-24 x 10(4).
CONCLUSION: Six mAbs against C.difficile toxin A with high titers were obtained 
successfully with satisfactory specificity and relative affinity, which will be 
useful for detection of C.difficile toxin A.
