Understanding the dynamics of secondary bile acid (SBA) formation in the gut by 
SBA-producing bacteria is important for host health, as SBAs have been shown to 
affect host pathophysiology and gut microbiota composition. However, our 
knowledge of SBA producers is limited in light of the diversity of gut microbes. 
Here, we isolated six novel SBA-producing bacteria from rat cecal contents, all 
of which were members of known species of gut microbes. Anaerostipes caccae D10, 
Bacteroides nordii C5, Clostridioides difficile D7, and Clostridium cadaveris 
G11 were capable of oxidizing cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into 
7-oxo-derivatives with varying yields. B. nordii C5 and its type strain JCM 
12987T had the highest molar yield, ∼90%. Clostridium disporicum F4 and 
Clostridium subterminale C4 epimerized cholic acid into ursocholic acid with 
yields of ∼85%; the corresponding type strains lacked epimerization activity. 
Furthermore, although not novel as an SBA producer, Clostridium scindens G10 
that produced deoxycholic acid from cholic acid was isolated for the first time 
from rodents. These findings will contribute to elucidation of SBA formation in 
the gut.
