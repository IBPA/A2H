BACKGROUND & AIMS: We studied the role of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)) 
and its activating enzymes, trypsins and tryptase, in Clostridium difficile 
toxin A (TxA)-induced enteritis.
METHODS: We injected TxA into ileal loops in PAR(2) or dipeptidyl peptidase I 
(DPPI) knockout mice or in wild-type mice pretreated with tryptase inhibitors 
(FUT-175 or MPI-0442352) or soybean trypsin inhibitor. We examined the effect of 
TxA on expression and activity of PAR(2) and trypsin IV messenger RNA in the 
ileum and cultured colonocytes. We injected activating peptide (AP), trypsins, 
tryptase, and p23 in wild-type mice, some pretreated with the neurokinin 1 
receptor antagonist SR140333.
RESULTS: TxA increased fluid secretion, myeloperoxidase activity in fluid and 
tissue, and histologic damage. PAR(2) deletion decreased TxA-induced ileitis, 
reduced luminal fluid secretion by 20%, decreased tissue and fluid 
myeloperoxidase by 50%, and diminished epithelial damage, edema, and neutrophil 
infiltration. DPPI deletion reduced secretion by 20% and fluid myeloperoxidase 
by 55%. In wild-type mice, FUT-175 or MPI-0442352 inhibited secretion by 24%-28% 
and tissue and fluid myeloperoxidase by 31%-71%. Soybean trypsin inhibitor 
reduced secretion to background levels and tissue myeloperoxidase by up to 50%. 
TxA increased expression of PAR(2) and trypsin IV in enterocytes and colonocytes 
and caused a 2-fold increase in Ca(2+) responses to PAR(2) AP. AP, tryptase, and 
trypsin isozymes (trypsin I/II, trypsin IV, p23) caused ileitis. SR140333 
prevented AP-induced ileitis.
CONCLUSIONS: PAR(2) and its activators are proinflammatory in TxA-induced 
enteritis. TxA stimulates existing PAR(2) and up-regulates PAR(2) and activating 
proteases, and PAR(2) causes inflammation by neurogenic mechanisms.
