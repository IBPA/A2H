Aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefoperazone and latamoxef (moxalactam) were evaluated 
in a hamster model for antibiotic-associated colitis. Aztreonam, a novel 
monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic specifically directed against aerobic 
Gram-negative bacteria with limited activity against Gram-positive and anaerobic 
bacteria did not cause haemorrhagic caecitis and death in hamsters when 
administered intraperitioneally or orally. Quantitative caecal cultures showed 
no changes in the anaerobic caecal microflora of hamsters treated 
intraperitoneally with aztreonam and only a temporary decrease in anaerobic 
Gram-negative bacilli in hamsters treated orally. Clostridium difficile and its 
cytotoxin were not present in these animals. Parenteral administration of 
ceftazidime also did not affect the anaerobic caecal microflora or cause 
caecitis. However, when given orally, ceftazidime suppressed the anaerobic 
caecal microflora and a lethal C. difficile-induced caecitis developed. 
Latamoxef or cefoperazone given parenterally resulted in caecitis and death in 
five days with marked changes in the anaerobic caecal microflora and C. 
difficile present in the caecal contents of these animals. The lethal 
haemorrhagic caecitis observed in this study was indistinguishable from that 
seen in the clindamycin-induced colitis model in the hamster. The possible 
correlation of these findings to gastrointestinal disturbances as a complication 
of antibiotic therapy in humans is discussed.
