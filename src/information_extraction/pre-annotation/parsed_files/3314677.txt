A DAP- auxotroph mutant of Escherichia coli DP50 requiring DAP and thymidine for 
growth was used as the receptor strain in genetic engineering. It failed to be 
implanted in axenic mice. However, when an inoculum containing more than 10(7) 
bacteria/ml was used, the DAP+ reverse mutant devoid of requirement for DAP 
became implanted. When axenic mice were previously associated with Clostridium 
difficile containing DAP in the cell wall, the strain DAP- became implanted even 
when the inoculum was too small to permit implantation in axenic mice. 
Conversely, C. butyricum and C. perenne, whose cell walls also contain DAP, did 
not allow the establishment of a DAP- mutant. In animals associated with complex 
human flora without enterobacteria, neither of the 2 DAP- and DAP+ mutants 
became implanted.
