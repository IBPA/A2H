Pathobionts play a critical role in disease development, but the immune 
mechanisms against pathobionts remain poorly understood. Here, we report a 
critical role for interleukin-22 (IL-22) in systemic protection against 
bacterial pathobionts that translocate into the circulation after infection with 
the pathogen Clostridium difficile. Infection with C. difficile induced IL-22, 
and infected Il22(-/-) mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in 
extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in 
mutant and wild-type mice. Pathobionts exhibited increased resistant against 
complement-mediated phagocytosis, and their intravenous administration resulted 
in high animal mortality. Selective removal of translocated commensals rescued 
Il22(-/-) mice, and IL-22 administration enhanced the elimination of 
pathobionts. Mechanistically, IL-22 augmented bacterial phagocytosis by 
increasing the expression and bacterial binding of complement C3. Our study 
demonstrates an unexpected role for IL-22 in controlling the elimination of 
pathobionts that enter the systemic circulation through the regulation of the 
complement system.
