Treatment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 2H3-hm1 cells with Clostridium 
difficile toxin B (2 ng/ml), which reportedly depolymerizes the actin 
cytoskeleton, blocked [3H]serotonin release induced by 2,4-dinitrophenyl-bovine 
serum albumin, carbachol, mastoparan, and reduced ionophore A23187-stimulated 
degranulation by about 55-60%. In lysates of RBL cells, toxin B 14C-glucosylated 
two major and one minor protein. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
and immunoblotting, RhoA and Cdc42 were identified as protein substrates of 
toxin B. In contrast to toxin B, Clostridium botulinum transferase C3 that 
selectively inactivates RhoA by ADP-ribosylation did not inhibit degranulation 
up to a concentration of 150 microg/ml. Antigen-stimulated tyrosine 
phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein was inhibited by toxin B as well as by the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Depolymerization of the 
microfilament cytoskeleton of RBL cells by C. botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin 
D resulted in an increased [3H]serotonin release induced by antigen, carbachol, 
mastoparan, or by calcium ionophore A23187, but without affecting toxin 
B-induced inhibition of degranulation. The data indicate that toxin B inhibits 
activation of RBL cells by glucosylation of low molecular mass GTP-binding 
proteins of the Rho subfamily (most likely Cdc42) by a mechanism not involving 
the actin cytoskeleton.
