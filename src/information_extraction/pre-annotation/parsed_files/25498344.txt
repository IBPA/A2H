Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The 
mechanisms underlying C. difficile expansion after microbiota disturbance are 
just emerging. We assessed the gene expression profile of C. difficile within 
the intestine of gnotobiotic mice to identify genes regulated in response to 
either dietary or microbiota compositional changes. In the presence of the gut 
symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, C. difficile induces a pathway that 
metabolizes the microbiota fermentation end-product succinate to butyrate. The 
low concentration of succinate present in the microbiota of conventional mice is 
transiently elevated upon antibiotic treatment or chemically induced intestinal 
motility disturbance, and C. difficile exploits this succinate spike to expand 
in the perturbed intestine. A C. difficile mutant compromised in succinate 
utilization is at a competitive disadvantage during these perturbations. 
Understanding the metabolic mechanisms involved in microbiota-C. difficile 
interactions may help to identify approaches for the treatment and prevention of 
C. difficile-associated diseases.
