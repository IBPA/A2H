Clostridium difficile is a pathogen responsible for diarrhoea and colitis, 
particularly after antibiotic treatment. We evaluated the C. difficile protease 
Cwp84, found to be associated with the S-layer proteins, as a vaccine antigen to 
limit the C. difficile intestinal colonization and therefore the development of 
the infection in a clindamycin-treated hamster model. First, we evaluated the 
immune response and the animal protection against death induced by several 
immunization routes: rectal, intragastric and subcutaneous. Antibody production 
was variable according to the immunization routes. In addition, serum Cwp84 
antibody titres did not always correlate with animal protection after challenge 
with a toxigenic C. difficile strain. The best survival rate was observed with 
the rectal route of immunization. Then, in a second assay, we selected this 
immunization route to perform a larger immunization assay including a Cwp84 
immunized group and a control group. Clostridium difficile intestinal 
colonization and survival rate, as well as the immune response were examined. 
Clostridium difficile hamster challenge resulted in a 26% weaker and slower C. 
difficile intestinal colonization in the immunized group. Furthermore, hamster 
survival in the Cwp84 immunized group was 33% greater than that of the control 
group, with a significant statistical difference.
