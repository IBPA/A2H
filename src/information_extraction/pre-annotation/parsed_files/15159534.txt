Clostridium difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-associated colitis, 
mediates inflammatory diarrhea by releasing toxin A, a potent 308-kDa 
enterotoxin. Toxin A-induced inflammatory diarrhea involves many steps, 
including mucosal release of substance P (SP) corticotropin-releasing hormone 
(CRH) and neutrophil transmigration. Here we demonstrate that, compared with 
wild type, mice genetically deficient in CRH (Crh(-/-)) have dramatically 
reduced ileal fluid secretion, epithelial cell damage, and neutrophil 
transmigration 4 h after intraluminal toxin A administration. This response is 
associated with diminished mucosal activity of the neutrophil enzyme 
myeloperoxidase compared with that of wildtype mice. In wild-type mice, toxin A 
stimulates an increase in intestinal SP content compared with buffer 
administration. In contrast, toxin A administration in Crh(-/-) mice fails to 
result in an increased SP content. Moreover, immunohistochemical experiments 
showed that CRH and SP are colocalized in some enteric nerves of wild-type mice, 
and this colocalization is more evident after toxin A administration. These 
results provide direct evidence for a major proinflammatory role for CRH in the 
pathophysiology of enterotoxin-mediated inflammatory diarrhea and indicate a 
SP-linked pathway.
