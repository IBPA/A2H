Neonatal porcine diarrhea (NPD) is a current problem on pig farms and is caused 
by several enteropathogens. Among them, Clostridioides difficile stands out due 
to its importance in piglets and zoonotic potential. A non-toxigenic strain of 
C. difficile (NTCD), named Z31, was previously tested in hamster and piglet 
experimental models as a strategy to prevent C. difficile infection (CDI). To 
evaluate the capacity of the strain Z31 to prevent CDI and NPD in one-day-old 
piglets on a commercial farm, 90 piglets from 16 litters received 1 × 106 spores 
of Z31 while 84 animals from the same litters served as controls. Animals were 
clinically evaluated, and fecal samples were collected 24 h after administration 
and submitted to A/B toxin detection and isolation of C. difficile. Stool 
samples were also submitted to rotavirus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium 
perfringens detection. Administration of Z31 reduced the incidence of CDI in 
treated animals (7.8%) when compared to the control group (25.0%; P = 0.003). In 
animals that developed CDI, the intensity of diarrhea was lower in those that 
received Z31 than in the control group. Neonatal porcine diarrhea was reduced in 
treated animals when compared to untreated animals (P < 0.001). The present 
study suggests that Z31 can potentially be used to prevent CDI in piglets on 
commercial farms.
