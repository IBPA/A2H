Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infection 
in the U.S. and considered an urgent threat by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC). Only two antibiotics, vancomycin and fidaxomicin, are 
FDA-approved for the treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI), but these 
therapies still suffer from high treatment failure and recurrence. Therefore, 
new chemical entities to treat CDI are needed. Trifluoromethylthio-containing 
N-(1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamides displayed very potent activities [sub-μg/mL 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values] against Gram-positive bacteria. 
Here, we report remarkable antibacterial activity enhancement via halogen 
substitutions, which afforded new anti-C. difficile agents with ultrapotent 
activities [MICs as low as 0.003 μg/mL (0.007 μM)] that surpassed the activity 
of vancomycin against C. difficile clinical isolates. The most promising 
compound in the series, HSGN-218, is nontoxic to mammalian colon cells and is 
gut-restrictive. In addition, HSGN-218 protected mice from CDI recurrence. Not 
only does this work provide a potential clinical lead for the development of C. 
difficile therapeutics but also highlights dramatic drug potency enhancement via 
halogen substitution.
