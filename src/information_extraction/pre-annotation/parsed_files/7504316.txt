We isolated Gram-positive circular bacterium HB1 from intestinal microflora 
showing resistance to colonization by Clostridium difficile in mice (Su et. al., 
1986a,b). We studied its enzymatic capacity to degrade mucin the first potential 
barrier to implantation of strains in the intestine. Its biochemical 
characteristics, terminal metabolites and the electrophoretic profiles of 
proteins and DNA-DNA homology indicated that it was a strain of Clostridium 
cocleatum. This strain displayed numerous glucosidase activities which were 
assumed to play a role in the degradation of mucin oligosaccharide chains in the 
digestive tract. These enzymes included alpha- and beta-galactosidases, 
beta-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, sialidase and 
alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.
