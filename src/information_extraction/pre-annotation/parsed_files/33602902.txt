Clostridioides difficile spores produced during infection are important for the 
recurrence of the disease. Here, we show that C. difficile spores gain entry 
into the intestinal mucosa via pathways dependent on host fibronectin-α5β1 and 
vitronectin-αvβ1. The exosporium protein BclA3, on the spore surface, is 
required for both entry pathways. Deletion of the bclA3 gene in C. difficile, or 
pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis using nystatin, leads to reduced entry 
into the intestinal mucosa and reduced recurrence of the disease in a mouse 
model. Our findings indicate that C. difficile spore entry into the intestinal 
barrier can contribute to spore persistence and infection recurrence, and 
suggest potential avenues for new therapies.
