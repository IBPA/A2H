Clostridium difficile is the primary cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in healthcare 
centres of the developed world. Only a few antibiotics are available for 
treatment, and relapses are common in patients undergoing antibiotic therapy. 
New approaches are required to reduce reliance on antibiotics, the use of which 
represents a primary risk factor for development of C. difficile infections. 
Supplementation of the gut flora with probiotics represents a key area for 
producing more successful treatment options for C. difficile infection (CDI). In 
this study, spores of B. subtilis have been evaluated as a potential probiotic 
treatment against CDI. Using a murine model of infection, we demonstrate that 
oral administration of B. subtilis spores can attenuate the symptoms of 
infection. We further show that (1) suppression of symptoms was better if spores 
were administered post infection, and (2) germination of the spore to a 
vegetative cell may be an integral part of how CDI is suppressed. The results of 
this study highlight the potential of this bacterium as a probiotic treatment 
for CDI.
