We investigated the increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) 
caused by the combined use of antibiotics and an immunosuppressive drug in a 
mouse model. Our data showed that an approximate return to pretreatment 
conditions of gut microbiota occurred within days after cessation of the 
antibiotic treatment, whereas the recovery of gut microbiota was delayed with 
the combined treatment of antibiotics and dexamethasone, leading to an increased 
severity of CDI. An alteration of gut microbiota is a key player in CDI. 
Therefore, our data implied that immunosuppressive drugs can increase the risk 
of CDI through the delayed recovery of altered gut microbiota.
