Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacterium that infects the lower 
intestinal tract of humans and is the most common known cause of diarrhea among 
hospitalized patients. Clostridium difficile colitis is mediated by toxins and 
develops during or following antibiotic administration. We have used a murine 
model of C. difficile infection, which reproduces the major features of the 
human disease, to study the effect of innate immune activation on resistance to 
C. difficile infection. We found that administration of purified 
Salmonella-derived flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist, protects 
mice from C. difficile colitis by delaying C. difficile growth and toxin 
production in the colon and cecum. TLR5 stimulation significantly improves 
pathological changes in the cecum and colon of C. difficile-infected mice and 
reduces epithelial cell loss. Flagellin treatment reduces epithelial apoptosis 
in the large intestine, thereby protecting the integrity of the intestinal 
epithelial barrier during C. difficile infection. We demonstrate that restoring 
intestinal innate immune tone by TLR stimulation in antibiotic-treated mice 
ameliorates intestinal inflammation and prevents death from C. difficile 
colitis, potentially providing an approach to prevent C. difficile-induced 
pathology.
