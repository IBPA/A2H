The Clostridium difficile exotoxin, TcdB, which is a major virulence factor, 
varies between strains of this pathogen. Herein, we show that TcdB from the 
epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain of C. difficile is more lethal, causes more 
extensive brain hemorrhage, and is antigenically variable from TcdB produced by 
previously studied strains of this pathogen (TcdB003). In mouse intoxication 
assays, TcdB from a ribotype 027 strain (TcdB027) was at least four fold more 
lethal than TcdB003. TcdB027 caused a previously undescribed brain hemorrhage in 
mice and this correlated with a heightened sensitivity of brain microvascular 
endothelial cells to the toxin. TcdB003 and TcdB027 also differed in their 
antigenic profiles and did not share cross-neutralizing epitopes in a major 
immunogenic region of the protein. Solid phase humoral mapping of epitopes in 
the carboxy-terminal domains (CTD) of TcdB027 and TcdB003 identified 11 reactive 
epitopes that varied between the two forms of TcdB, and 13 epitopes that were 
shared or overlapping. Despite the epitope differences and absence of 
neutralizing epitopes in the CTD of TcdB027, a toxoid form of this toxin primed 
a strong protective response. These findings indicate TcdB027 is a more potent 
toxin than TcdB003 as measured by lethality assays and pathology, moreover the 
sequence differences between the two forms of TcdB alter antigenic epitopes and 
reduce cross-neutralization by antibodies targeting the CTD.
