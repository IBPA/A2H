BACKGROUND & AIMS: Leptin regulates energy homeostasis and participates in the 
regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Although hyperleptinemia 
is described in experimental colitis, its role in the pathophysiology of 
enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea and inflammation remains unclear. We examined the 
role of leptin in the inflammatory diarrhea induced by toxin A from Clostridium 
difficile, the causative agent of antibiotic-related colitis.
METHODS: Toxin A (10 microg) or buffer were administered in ileal loops of 
leptin-deficient (ob/ob), leptin-resistant (db/db), or wild-type mice and 
enterotoxic responses were measured.
RESULTS: In toxin A-treated wild-type mice, circulating leptin and 
corticosterone levels were increased compared with buffer-injected animals. 
Toxin A also stimulated increased mucosal expression of the Ob-Rb at the 
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level. Ob/ob and db/db mice were partially 
protected against toxin A-induced intestinal secretion and inflammation, and 
this effect was reversed by leptin administration in ob/ob, but not db/db, mice. 
Basal- and toxin A-stimulated plasma corticosterone levels in ob/ob and db/db 
mice were higher compared with toxin A-treated wild-type mice. To assess whether 
the effect of leptin in intestinal inflammation is mediated by corticosteroids 
we performed adrenalectomy experiments in db/db and wild-type mice. Our results 
suggested that the diminished intestinal response to toxin A in db/db mice was 
related only in part to increased levels of corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptin plays an important role in regulating the severity of 
enterotoxin-mediated intestinal secretion and inflammation by activating both 
corticosteroid-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
