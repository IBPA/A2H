Tetracyclines were implicated in the 1950s in induction of protracted diarrhea 
and pseudomembranous colitis. Because the pathogenetic mechanism of these 
illnesses has been questioned recently, we studied tetracycline in hamster 
models of antibiotic-associated colitis. Orogastric administration of 
tetracycline caused diarrhea and death, with evidence of hemorrhagic typhlitis. 
Filtrates of cecal contents were toxic when inoculated into normal hamsters and 
cell culture monolayers, and toxicity was neutralized with Clostridium sordellii 
antitoxin. Tetracycline-resistant C. difficile was cultured from stools of these 
hamsters, but Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. The value of tetracycline 
for treatment or prevention of clindamycin-induced colitis in hamsters was also 
studied, and it was found that daily orogastric administration of tetracycline 
was poorly protective against clindamycin-induced colitis.
