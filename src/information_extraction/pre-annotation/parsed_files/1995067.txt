ADP-ribosylation of a protein in human fibroblasts treated with partially 
purified Clostridium difficile toxin B was previously reported. Here we show 
that the same protein was ADP-ribosylated also in human fibroblasts exposed to 
supernatant from a C. difficile strain producing neither toxin A nor toxin B. 
Furthermore, in Chinese hamster ovary and in Vero cells, showing toxin B-induced 
cytopathogenic effect, the protein was not significantly ADP-ribosylated. The 
results indicate that the ADP-ribosylation is unrelated to the cytopathogenic 
effect of toxin B. It appears to be caused by another unidentified factor from 
C. difficile, and the substrate may correspond to a protein modified 
endogenously in cells exposed to stressful situations. Cellular actin was not 
ADP-ribosylated by toxin B.
