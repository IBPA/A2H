A variety of bacteria are known or suspected of being able to cause enteritis in 
dogs and cats. Campylobacter spp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium 
perfringens, and Salmonella spp are most commonly implicated, but many other 
organisms are likely involved. Poor understanding of the intestinal microflora 
and the fact that many, if not all, of these microorganisms can also be found in 
healthy individuals complicates testing, thereby affecting the use of specific 
treatments and assessment of potential infection control and zoonotic disease 
risks. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic 
options is important for the management of canine and feline enteritis.
