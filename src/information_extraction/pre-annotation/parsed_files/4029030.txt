The studies reported here were designed to ascertain whether or not the new 
beta-lactam antibiotic, temocillin, would produce antibiotic-associated colitis 
in the hamster. The experiments were controlled with clindamycin and cefoxitin, 
which are known to induce antibiotic-associated colitis experimentally and 
clinically. All three antibiotics were administered to groups of animals both 
parenterally and orally. Clindamycin, at 1 mg/hamster, caused a slow onset of 
antibiotic-associated colitis by both routes, with death occurring at between 4 
and 8 days. 80 to 100% of the animals had diarrhoea and showed signs of 
haemorrhage and caecal distension, with the caecal contents being Clostridium 
difficile toxin-positive. The onset of antibiotic-associated colitis after 
administration of cefoxitin was less marked at the 1 mg parenteral dose, with 
only 40% of the hamsters showing signs of colitis. At the higher doses of 
cefoxitin, colitis was more severe and the animals exhibited dramatic weight 
loss, with death occurring at between 3 and 5 days. The majority of animals had 
diarrhoea and were C. difficile toxin-positive; 60 to 80% also showed signs of 
haemorrhage and caecal distension. In contrast, the hamsters receiving 
temocillin remained healthy with no signs of diarrhoea, and showed consistent 
weight gain. No pathological abnormalities were observed and the caecal contents 
were toxin-negative. These results suggest that temocillin therapy in humans is 
unlikely to cause significant disturbance of the gastrointestinal flora.
