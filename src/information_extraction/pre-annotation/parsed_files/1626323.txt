The effect of toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile on human colon carcinoma 
cells (HT-29, epithelial), rhesus monkey kidney cells (MA-104, epithelial) and 
green monkey kidney cells (VERO, fibroblast) was studied. Both toxins caused 
rounding of HT-29 cells and rounding with projections remaining attached to the 
substrate in MA-104 and VERO cells; however, the sensitivity to each toxin 
varies considerably. Toxin A was detected in ng by VERO, pg by HT-29 and 
fractions of pg by MA-104 cells; for toxin B, pg were detected by VERO, ng by 
MA-104 and micrograms by HT-29 cells. HT-29 cells were grown with galactose to 
allow their differentiation to enterocytes, and their sensitivity to the toxins 
during the process was studied. At early stages, the sensitivity to both toxins 
was similar, and as the differentiation proceeded, the response to both toxins 
decreased continuously, and after 16 days no evident morphological effect was 
observed, even with micrograms amounts of either toxin. In contrast to all cell 
lines reported to date, HT-29 and MA-104 epithelial cells are exquisitely 
sensitive to toxin A and less responsive to toxin B. The rounding of HT-29 by 
these toxins depends on the degree of differentiation of the cell.
