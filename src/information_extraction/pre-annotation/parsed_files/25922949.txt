Clostridium difficile is responsible for 15-20% of antibiotic-associated 
diarrheas, and nearly all cases of pseudomembranous colitis. Among the cell wall 
proteins involved in the colonization process, Cwp84 is a protease that cleaves 
the S-layer protein SlpA into two subunits. A cwp84 mutant was previously shown 
to be affected for in vitro growth but not in its virulence in a hamster model. 
In this study, the cwp84 mutant elaborated biofilms with increased biomass 
compared with the parental strain, allowing the mutant to grow more robustly in 
the biofilm state. Proteomic analyses of the 630Î”erm bacteria growing within the 
biofilm revealed the distribution of abundant proteins either in cell surface, 
matrix or supernatant fractions. Of note, the toxin TcdA was found in the 
biofilm matrix. Although the overall proteome differences between the cwp84 
mutant and the parental strains were modest, there was still a significant 
impact on bacterial surface properties such as altered hydrophobicity. In vitro 
and in vivo competition assays revealed that the mutant was significantly 
impaired for growth only in the planktonic state, but not in biofilms or in 
vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that the phenotypes in the cwp84 
mutant come from either the accumulation of uncleaved SlpA, or the ability of 
Cwp84 to cleave as yet undetermined proteins.
