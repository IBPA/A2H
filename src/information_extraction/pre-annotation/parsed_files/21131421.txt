The injection of Clostridium difficile toxin A into the ileal loops caused fluid 
accumulation with the destruction of intestinal epithelial structure and the 
recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Concomitantly, intraileal gene 
expression of CX3CL1/fractalkine (FKN) and its receptor, CX3CR1, was enhanced. 
When treated with toxin A in a similar manner, CX3CR1-deficient (CX3CR1(-/-)) 
mice exhibited exaggerated fluid accumulation, histopathological alterations, 
and neutrophil recruitment, but not macrophage infiltration. Mice reconstituted 
with CX3CR1(-/-) mouse-derived bone marrow cells exhibited exacerbated toxin 
A-induced enteritis, indicating that the lack of the CX3CR1 gene for 
hematopoietic cells aggravated toxin A-induced enteritis. A heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1) inhibitor, tin-protoporphyrin-IX, markedly increased fluid accumulation 
in toxin A-treated wild-type mice, indicating the protective roles of HO-1 in 
this situation. HO-1 expression was detected mainly in F4/80-positive cells 
expressing CX3CR1, and CX3CR1(-/-) mice failed to increase HO-1 expression after 
toxin A treatment. Moreover, CX3CL1/FKN induced HO-1 gene expression by isolated 
lamina propria-derived macrophages or a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, 
through the activation of the ERK signal pathway. Thus, CX3CL1/FKN could induce 
CX3CR1-expressing macrophages to express HO-1, thereby ameliorating toxin 
A-induced enteritis.
