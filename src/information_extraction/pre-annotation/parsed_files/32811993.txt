Severe Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI) is life-threatening and responds 
poorly to treatment. Obesity is associated with development of severe CDI. 
Therefore, to define the mechanisms that exacerbate disease severity, we 
examined CDI pathogenesis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice. Compared to 
control mice, HFD-fed mice failed to clear C. difficile bacteria which resulted 
in protracted diarrhea, weight loss and colonic damage. After infection, 
HFD-induced obese mice had an intestinal bile acid (BA) pool that was dominated 
by primary BAs which are known promoters of C. difficile spore germination, and 
lacked secondary BAs that inhibit C. difficile growth. Concurrently, synthesis 
of primary BAs from liver was significantly increased in C. difficile-infected 
HFD-fed mice. A key pathway that regulates hepatic BA synthesis is via feedback 
inhibition from intestinal Farnesoid X receptors (FXRs). Our data reveal that 
the proportion of FXR agonist BAs to FXR antagonist BAs in the intestinal lumen 
was significantly reduced in HFD-fed mice after CDI. Treatment of HFD-fed mice 
with an FXR agonist Obeticholic acid, resulted in decreased primary BA 
synthesis, fewer C. difficile bacteria and better CDI outcomes. Thus, OCA 
treatment holds promise as a therapy for severe CDI.
