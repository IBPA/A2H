BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause a wide range of 
disease, from mild diarrhea to fulminant systemic disease. The incidence of 
systemic CDI with fatal consequence has increased rapidly in recent years.
METHODS: Using an ultrasensitive cytotoxicity assay, we measured C. difficile 
toxin A (TcdA) and C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) in sera and body fluids of 
piglets and mice exposed to C. difficile to investigate the relationship between 
the presence of toxins in body fluids and systemic manifestations of CDI.
RESULTS: We found that both TcdA and TcdB disseminate systemically, with toxins 
present in the sera and body fluids of infected animals, and toxemia is 
significantly correlated with the development of systemic CDI. The systemic 
administration of neutralizing antibodies against both toxins blocked the 
development of systemic disease in mice. We measured cytokine concentrations in 
the sera of mice and piglets with systemic and nonsystemic CDI and found that 
proinflammatory mediators were considerably elevated in animals with systemic 
CDI.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the existence of a strong correlation between 
toxemia and the occurrence of systemic disease, supporting the hypothesis that 
systemic CDI is most likely due to the toxicity of TcdA and TcdB and the 
induction of proinflammatory cytokines by the toxins.
