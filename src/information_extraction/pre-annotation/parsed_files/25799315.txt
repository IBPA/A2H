The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection has increased in Western world 
in the past 10 years, similar infection rates are also reported in developing 
countries such as China. Current antibiotics treatments have recurrence rates 
between 15% and 30%. IgY antibodies against toxin A of C. difficile could 
protect animal models from the challenge of lethal dose of C. difficile spores. 
However, IgY is sensitive to the low pH environment of the stomach and 
proteinases in the intestine. The objective of this study was to prepare 
colonic-specific delivery system of toxin A antigen-specific IgY to block the 
recognition of toxin A to the colon mucosa cells. Egg-laying hens were immunized 
with purified C. difficile toxin A C-terminal domain for 3 times, then egg IgY 
against the recombinant ToxA-C protein was purified from immunized egg yolk and 
frozen dried. IgY-loaded microbeads were prepared using mini fluid bed system; 
the loading efficiency was 21%. The pH and temperature stabilities of the 
microbeads were assayed. The IgY-loaded microbeads coated with 35% Eudragit S100 
had colonic-specific IgY release specificity both in vitro and in vivo, the 
colonic-specific release of biological active IgY was 87.5% in the rat. Our 
study provides a new option for the biological treatment C. difficile infection.
