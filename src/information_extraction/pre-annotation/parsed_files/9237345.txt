A specific monoclonal antibody against toxin A from Clostridium difficile was 
generated that did not show thermolabile binding. Nonspecific murine monoclonal 
antibodies bound toxin A at 4 degrees C, but less effectively at 37 degrees C. 
Nonspecific human monoclonal antibodies did not bind to toxin A at 4 degrees C. 
Cytotoxic properties of purified toxin A were not inhibited by Bandeiraea 
simplicifolia lectin. This points to a carbohydrate moiety on the cell surface 
and a multivalent nonspecific carbohydrate binding ligand on toxin A.
