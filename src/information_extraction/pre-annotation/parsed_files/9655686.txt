We previously reported that the inflammatory effects of Clostridium difficile 
toxin A on rat intestine can be significantly inhibited with a specific 
neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. In this study we investigated the 
localization and expression of NK-1R mRNA and protein in rat intestine by in 
situ hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, 
respectively, after exposure to toxin A. Northern blot analysis showed increased 
mucosal levels of NK-1R mRNA starting 30 min after toxin A administration. In 
situ hybridization showed that toxin A increased NK-1R mRNA expression in 
intestinal epithelial cells after 30, 120, and 180 min. In rats pretreated with 
the NK-1R antagonist CP-96345 the increase in NK-1R mRNA levels after exposure 
to toxin A was inhibited, indicating that NK-1R upregulation is substance P (SP) 
dependent. One hour after exposure to toxin A many of the intestinal epithelial 
cells showed staining for NK-1R compared with controls. Specific 125I-SP binding 
to purified epithelial cell membranes obtained from ileum exposed to toxin A for 
15 min was increased twofold over control and persisted for 4 h. This report 
provides evidence that NK-1R expression is increased in the intestinal 
epithelium shortly after exposure to toxin A and may be important in toxin 
A-induced inflammation.
