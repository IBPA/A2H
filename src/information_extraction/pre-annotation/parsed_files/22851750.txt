We show in this study that toxin production in Clostridium difficile is altered 
in cells which can no longer form flagellar filaments. The impact of 
inactivation of fliC, CD0240, fliF, fliG, fliM, and flhB-fliR flagellar genes 
upon toxin levels in culture supernatants was assessed using cell-based 
cytotoxicity assay, proteomics, immunoassay, and immunoblotting approaches. Each 
of these showed that toxin levels in supernatants were significantly increased 
in a fliC mutant compared to that in the C. difficile 630 parent strain. In 
contrast, the toxin levels in supernatants secreted from other flagellar mutants 
were significantly reduced compared with that in the parental C. difficile 630 
strain. Transcriptional analysis of the pathogenicity locus genes (tcdR, tcdB, 
tcdE, and tcdA) revealed a significant increase of all four genes in the fliC 
mutant strain, while transcription of all four genes was significantly reduced 
in fliM, fliF, fliG, and flhB-fliR mutants. These results demonstrate that toxin 
transcription in C. difficile is modulated by the flagellar regulon. More 
significantly, mutant strains showed a corresponding change in virulence 
compared to the 630 parent strain when tested in a hamster model of C. difficile 
infection. This is the first demonstration of differential flagellum-related 
transcriptional regulation of toxin production in C. difficile and provides 
evidence for elaborate regulatory networks for virulence genes in C. difficile.
