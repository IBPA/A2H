Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is a key predisposing factor for Clostridium 
difficile infections (CDIs), which cause intestinal disease ranging from mild 
diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. Here, we examined the impact of a 
microbiota-derived metabolite, short-chain fatty acid acetate, on an acute mouse 
model of CDI. We found that administration of acetate is remarkably beneficial 
in ameliorating disease. Mechanistically, we show that acetate enhances innate 
immune responses by acting on both neutrophils and ILC3s through its cognate 
receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2). In neutrophils, acetate-FFAR2 
signaling accelerates their recruitment to the inflammatory sites, facilitates 
inflammasome activation, and promotes the release of IL-1β; in ILC3s, 
acetate-FFAR2 augments expression of the IL-1 receptor, which boosts IL-22 
secretion in response to IL-1β. We conclude that microbiota-derived acetate 
promotes host innate responses to C. difficile through coordinate action on 
neutrophils and ILC3s.
