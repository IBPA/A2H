Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in developed countries. The disease 
is mainly mediated via two major exotoxins TcdA and TcdB secreted by the 
bacterium. We have previously developed a novel, potently neutralizing, 
tetravalent and bispecific heavy-chain-only single domain (VHH) antibody to both 
TcdA and TcdB (designated as ABA) that reverses fulminant CDI in mice. Since ABA 
has a short serum half-life, in this study a replication-deficient recombinant 
adenovirus expressing ABA was generated and the long-lasting expression of 
functional ABA was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo Mice transduced with one 
dose of the adenovirus displayed high levels of serum ABA for more than1 month 
and were fully protected against systemic toxin challenges. More importantly, 
the ABA delivered by the adenovirus protected mice from both primary and 
recurrent CDI. Thus, replication-deficient adenoviral vector may be used to 
deliver neutralizing antibodies against the toxins in order to prevent CDI and 
recurrence.
