Human gut microbiota plays critical roles in physiology and disease. Our 
understanding of ecological principles that govern the dynamics and resilience 
of this highly complex ecosystem remains rudimentary. This knowledge gap becomes 
more problematic as new approaches to modifying this ecosystem, such as fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being developed as therapeutic 
interventions. Here we present an ecological framework to understand the 
efficacy of FMT in treating conditions associated with a disrupted gut 
microbiota, using the recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection as a 
prototype disease. This framework predicts several key factors that determine 
the efficacy of FMT. Moreover, it offers an efficient algorithm for the rational 
design of personalized probiotic cocktails to decolonize pathogens. We analyze 
data from both preclinical mouse experiments and a clinical trial of FMT to 
validate our theoretical framework. The presented results significantly improve 
our understanding of the ecological principles of FMT and have a positive 
translational impact on the rational design of general microbiota-based 
therapeutics.
