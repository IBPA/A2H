Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective tool for treating 
Clostridium difficile infection in the setting of dysbiosis of the intestinal 
microbiome. FMT for other forms of human disorders linked to dysbiosis have been 
less effective. The fecal microbiota contains a high density of virus-like 
particles (VLP), up to 90% of which are bacteriophages, thought to have a role 
in regulating gut bacterial populations. We hypothesized that transplantation of 
the phage-containing fecal VLP fraction may reduce bacterial density in the 
dysbiotic setting of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). In an 
experiment using fecal transplantation, we compared the effect of the fecal VLP 
fraction (bacteria removed) against "Whole" FMT (bacteria intact) on the ileal 
microbiome. Recipients were either treated with a 30-day high-fat diet (HFD) as 
a model of dysbiosis to induce SIBO or were on a standard diet (SD). We observed 
that transplantation of fecal VLPs from donors on a HFD was sufficient to alter 
the ileal microbiota, but the effect was dependent on diet of the recipient. In 
recipients on a HFD, ileal bacterial density was reduced. In recipients on a SD, 
the ileal microbiome transitioned toward the composition associated with a HFD. 
In both recipient groups, transplantation of fecal VLP fraction alone produced 
the same outcome as whole FMT. Neither treatment altered expression of 
antimicrobial peptides. These findings demonstrated a potential role of VLPs, 
likely phages, for modifying the gut microbiome during dysbiosis.
