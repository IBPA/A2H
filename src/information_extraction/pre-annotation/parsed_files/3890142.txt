The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been analysed in coecal and 
small-intestinal content of conventional (CONV) and germfree (GF) mice, in 
germfree mice monocontaminated with Escherichia coli (MEC) or Clostridium 
difficile (MCD), and in germfree mice conventionalized by the visitor technique 
(EXG). The total concentrations of SCFAs in coecal content, measured by gas 
chromatography, were (mean (SD), mmol/kg): CONV, 125.2 (32.9); GF, 1.02 (0.39); 
MEC, 6.88 (0.76); MCD, 4.50 (0.12); and EXG, 115.6 (17.4). The concentrations of 
SCFAs were 3- to 25-fold higher in the coecum than in the small intestine in 
CONV, MEC, and EXG mice (p less than 0.05). The fermentation patterns (that is, 
the relative composition of the acids) of E. coli and Cl. difficile were 
distinctively different under defined in vitro conditions and similar to those 
found in intestinal content of monocontaminated animals. Combined gas 
chromatography and mass spectrometry showed that Cl. difficile produced an 
unusual metabolite, 2-methylbutyric acid, in vitro and in vivo. The findings 
indicate that the fermentation patterns are closely related to the bacteria. 
Variations in the bacterial flora may be more important in determining the 
concentrations and patterns of SCFAs in intestinal content than variations in 
the intake of substrate for SCFAs formation as dietary fibre.
