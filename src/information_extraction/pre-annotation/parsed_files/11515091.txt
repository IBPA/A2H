Gnotobiotic Wistar rats were produced using gnotobiotic techniques, which were 
established in the production of a SPF mouse colony, in order to establish a 
barrier-sustained colony. One strain of Escherichia coli, 28 strains of 
Bacteriodaceae (B-strains), three strains of Lactobacillus (L-strains) and a 
chloroform-treated fecal suspension (CHF, Clostridium mixture) were prepared 
from conventional Wistar rats as the microflora source. Two groups of 
limited-flora rats, E. coli plus B-strains and E. coli plus CHF, were produced. 
After confirmation that Clostridium difficile was not detected in the 
CHF-inoculated rats, two groups of limited-flora rats were transferred to an 
isolator and housed together in a cage. These rats were then orally inoculated 
with L-strains. The gnotobiotic rats showed colonization resistance to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the number of E. coli in the feces was 10(5) to 
10(6)/g. The gnotobiotic rats were transferred to a barrier room as a source of 
intestinal flora for SPF colonies. In the SPF rats, basic cecal flora was mainly 
composed of Bacteroidaceae, clostridia, fusiform-shaped bacteria and 
lactobacilli, and did not change over a long period. Their flora became similar 
to that of conventional rats.
