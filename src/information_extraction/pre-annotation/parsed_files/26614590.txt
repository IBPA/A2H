Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea, also 
known as C. difficile associated diarrhea. The two major toxins, toxin A and 
toxin B are produced by most C. difficile bacteria, but some strains, such as 
BI/NAP1/027 isolates, produce a third toxin called binary toxin. The precise 
biological role of binary toxin is not clear but it has been shown to be a 
cytotoxin for Vero cells. We evaluated the toxicity of these toxins in mice and 
hamsters and found that binary toxin causes death in both animals similar to 
toxins A and B. Furthermore, immunization of mice with mutant toxoids of all 
three toxins provided protection upon challenge with native toxins. These 
results support the concept that binary toxin contributes to the pathogenicity 
of C. difficile and provide a method for monitoring the toxicity of binary toxin 
components in vaccines.
