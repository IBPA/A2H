The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was 
determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, 
Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of 
Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus 
mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of 
bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during 
the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V 
cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P 
mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from 
the stools in 14 da.
