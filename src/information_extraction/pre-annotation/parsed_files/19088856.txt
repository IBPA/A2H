BACKGROUND: Bacterial gastroenteritis causes morbidity and mortality in humans 
worldwide. Murine Citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for gastroenteritis 
caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and 
enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. Mucin glycoproteins are the main component of the 
first barrier that bacteria encounter in the intestinal tract.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using Immunohistochemistry, we investigated 
intestinal expression of mucins (Alcian blue/PAS, Muc1, Muc2, Muc4, Muc5AC, 
Muc13 and Muc3/17) in healthy and C. rodentium infected mice. The majority of 
the C. rodentium infected mice developed systemic infection and colitis in the 
mid and distal colon by day 12. C. rodentium bound to the major secreted mucin, 
Muc2, in vitro, and high numbers of bacteria were found in secreted MUC2 in 
infected animals in vivo, indicating that mucins may limit bacterial access to 
the epithelial surface. In the small intestine, caecum and proximal colon, the 
mucin expression was similar in infected and non-infected animals. In the distal 
colonic epithelium, all secreted and cell surface mucins decreased with the 
exception of the Muc1 cell surface mucin which increased after infection 
(p<0.05). Similarly, during human infection Salmonella St Paul, Campylobacter 
jejuni and Clostridium difficile induced MUC1 in the colon.
CONCLUSION: Major changes in both the cell-surface and secreted mucins occur in 
response to intestinal infection.
