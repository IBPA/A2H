The intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile exhibits heterogeneity in 
motility and toxin production. This phenotypic heterogeneity is achieved through 
phase variation by site-specific recombination via the DNA recombinase RecV, 
which reversibly inverts the "flagellar switch" upstream of the flgB operon. A 
recV mutation prevents flagellar switch inversion and results in phenotypically 
locked strains. The orientation of the flagellar switch influences expression of 
the flgB operon post-transcription initiation, but the specific molecular 
mechanism is unknown. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of 
spontaneous suppressor mutants in the non-motile, non-toxigenic recV flg OFF 
background that regained motility and toxin production. The restored phenotypes 
corresponded with increased expression of flagellum and toxin genes. The motile 
suppressor mutants contained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rho, 
which encodes the bacterial transcription terminator Rho factor. Analyses using 
transcriptional reporters indicate that Rho contributes to heterogeneity in 
flagellar gene expression by preferentially terminating transcription of flg OFF 
mRNA within the 5' leader sequence. Additionally, Rho is important for initial 
colonization of the intestine in a mouse model of infection, which may in part 
be due to the sporulation and growth defects observed in the rho mutants. 
Together these data implicate Rho factor as a regulator of gene expression 
affecting phase variation of important virulence factors of C. difficile.
