In people, fecal microbiota transplantation is recognized as the best treatment 
modality for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in people, and its 
value is currently investigated in the treatment of other diseases associated 
with an abnormal gut microbiome. In dogs, intestinal dysbiosis has been 
documented in many acute and chronic digestive diseases as well as in diseases 
of other organ systems. There are only few published studies evaluating the 
benefits of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in canine gastrointestinal 
disorders. They provide evidence that FMT may be beneficial in the treatment of 
acute intestinal diseases and hope that the technique might also be useful for 
the management of chronic enteropathies.
