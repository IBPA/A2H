Mutations in MEFV, the gene encoding pyrin in humans, are associated with the 
autoinflammatory disorder familial Mediterranean fever. Pyrin is an innate 
sensor that assembles into an inflammasome complex in response to Rho-modifying 
toxins, including Clostridium difficile toxins A and B. Cell death pathways have 
been shown to intersect with and modulate inflammasome activation, thereby 
affecting host defense. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages and a murine model 
of peritonitis, we show in this study that receptor-interacting protein kinase 
(RIPK) 3 impacts pyrin inflammasome activation independent of its role in 
necroptosis. RIPK3 was instead required for transcriptional upregulation of Mefv 
through negative control of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway 
and independent of alterations in MAPK and NF-ÎºB signaling. RIPK3 did not affect 
pyrin dephosphorylation associated with inflammasome activation. We further 
demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR was sufficient to promote Mefv expression 
and pyrin inflammasome activation, highlighting the cross-talk between the mTOR 
pathway and regulation of the pyrin inflammasome. Our study reveals a novel 
interaction between molecules involved in cell death and the mTOR pathway to 
regulate the pyrin inflammasome, which can be harnessed for therapeutic 
interventions.
