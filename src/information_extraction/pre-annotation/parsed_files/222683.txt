Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, and C. tertium are very often present 
simultaneously in the feces of conventional diarrheic young hares, whereas these 
three bacterial species are rarely encountered and never present simultaneously 
in the feces of healthy young hares. When a strain of each of the three 
bacterial species was monoassociated with axenic young hares, the appearance of 
pathological disorders was only observed in animals monoassociated with C. 
difficile, when the number of C. difficile exceeded 10(8) per g of fresh feces. 
When a strain of C. perfringens or a strain of C. tertium, or both, was 
associated with C. difficile, diarrhea and death occurred more rapidly than in 
hares monoassociated with C. difficile. C. difficile and C. perfringens became 
established more rapidly when disassociated than when monoassociated with axenic 
hares. The association of C. perfringens and C. tertium with axenic hares did 
not bring about any pathological disorders. It may be concluded that C. 
difficile is the causal agent of neonatal diarrhea in conventional and 
gnotobiotic young hares and that other strains of Clostridium enhance its 
pathogenic effect. C difficile alone or associated with C. perfringens or C. 
tertium does not play any pathogenic role in young rats, mice, or rabbits.
