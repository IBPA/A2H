Storage procedures are known to affect the detectability of Clostridium 
difficile toxins in equine and human feces. We assessed the impact of different 
storage conditions on the detectability of C. difficile toxins in swine feces. 
Specimens were inoculated with toxins, 112 ng/g of toxin A (TcdA) and 16 ng/g of 
toxin B (TcdB) and subjected to the following 3 storage treatments: 4°C, -30°C, 
repetitive freezing at -30°C and thawing. Toxin determination was assessed at 1, 
2, 7, 14, and 21 d with ELISA. A decrease in concentrations of TcdA with time 
was observed for samples stored at 4°C and repetitive freezing-thawing (p 
≤0.05). On day 14, storage at 4°C resulted in decreased TcdA concentration as 
opposed to storage at -30°C and repetitive freezing-thawing (p ≤0.05). On day 
21, storage at 4°C resulted in decreased TcdA detectability compared with 
storage at -30°C (p ≤0.05). The TcdB concentration was unaffected. These results 
on toxin detectability in swine feces should be carefully considered in in vitro 
studies on toxigenic C. difficile. Our results also offer valuable information 
for microbiologists and veterinarians monitoring the presence of virulent C. 
difficile in pigs.
