The increasing incidence of primary and recurring Clostridioides difficile 
infections (CDI), which evade current treatment strategies, reflects the 
changing biology of C difficile. Here, we describe a putative plasmid-mediated 
mechanism potentially driving decreased sensitivity of C difficile to vancomycin 
treatment. We identified a broad host range transferable plasmid in a C 
difficile strain associated with lack of adequate response to vancomycin 
treatment. The transfer of this plasmid to a vancomycin-susceptible C difficile 
isolate decreased its susceptibility to vancomycin inÂ vitro and resulted in more 
severe disease in a humanized mouse model. Our findings suggest plasmid 
acquisition in the gastrointestinal tract to be a possible mechanism underlying 
vancomycin treatment failure in patients with CDI, but further work is needed to 
characterize the mechanism by which plasmid genes determine vancomycin 
susceptibility in C difficile.
