Clostridium difficile impairs Paneth cells, driving intestinal inflammation that 
exaggerates colitis. Besides secreting bactericidal products to restrain C. 
difficile, Paneth cells act as guardians that constitute a niche for intestinal 
epithelial stem cell (IESC) regeneration. However, how IESCs are sustained to 
specify Paneth-like cells as their niche remains unclear. Cytokine-JAK-STATs are 
required for IESC regeneration. We investigated how constitutive STAT5 
activation (Ca-pYSTAT5) restricts IESC differentiation towards niche cells to 
restrain C. difficile infection. We generated inducible transgenic mice and 
organoids to determine the effects of Ca-pYSTAT5-induced IESC lineages on C. 
difficile colitis. We found that STAT5 absence reduced Paneth cells and 
predisposed mice to C. difficile ileocolitis. In contrast, Ca-pYSTAT5 enhanced 
Paneth cell lineage tracing and restricted Lgr5 IESC differentiation towards 
pYSTAT5+Lgr5-CD24+Lyso+ or cKit+ niche cells, which imprinted Lgr5hiKi67+ IESCs. 
Mechanistically, pYSTAT5 activated Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling to determine Paneth 
cell fate. In conclusion, Ca-pYSTAT5 gradients control niche differentiation. 
Lack of pYSTAT5 reduces the niche cells to sustain IESC regeneration and induces 
C. difficile ileocolitis. STAT5 may be a transcription factor that regulates 
Paneth cells to maintain niche regeneration.
