Outbred Mongolian gerbils from a United States commercial source were examined 
for colonization with naturally occurring enterohepatic Helicobacter spp. 
Helicobacter spp. were identified in the cecum and colon by culture and by using 
genus-specific primers in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Nutritionally 
balanced triple-antibiotic wafers (containing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and 
bismuth) used previously to eliminate helicobacter infections in mice were 
administered in an attempt to eradicate the naturally occurring novel 
helicobacters in the gerbils. After 7 days of antibiotic treatment, two of the 
experimental animals died due to Clostridium difficile-associated enterotoxemia. 
However, at 3 weeks after antibiotic cessation, the surviving three animals had 
no Helicobacter spp. in the cecum or colon according to PCR analysis. 
Eradication of Helicobacter spp. using dietary administration of antibiotics was 
complicated by the presence of toxin-producing C. difficile. An alternate method 
to develop helicobacter-free gerbils (such as Caesarian rederivation) may be 
necessary.
