There is currently substantial interest in the therapeutic properties of 
probiotic microorganisms as recent research suggests that oral administration of 
specific bacterial strains may reduce inflammation and alter the nature of 
endogenous microflora in the gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophils are 
multifunctional tissue leukocytes, prominent among the resident cells of the 
gastrointestinal mucosa that promote local immunity. Recent studies with 
genetically altered mice indicate that eosinophils not only participate in 
maintaining gut homeostasis, but that the absence of eosinophils may have 
significant impact on the nature of the endogenous gut microflora and responses 
to gut pathogens, notably Clostridium difficile Furthermore, in human subjects, 
there is an intriguing relationship between eosinophils, allergic inflammation, 
and the nature of the lung microflora, notably a distinct association between 
eosinophil infiltration and detection of bacteria of the phylum Actinobacteria. 
Among topics for future research, it will be important to determine whether 
homeostatic mechanisms involve direct interactions between eosinophils and 
bacteria or whether they involve primarily eosinophil-mediated responses to 
cytokine signaling in the local microenvironment. Likewise, although is it clear 
that eosinophils can and do interact with bacteria in vivo, their ability to 
discern between pathogenic and probiotic species in various settings remains to 
be explored.
