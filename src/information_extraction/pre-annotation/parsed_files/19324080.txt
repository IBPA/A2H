Clostridium difficile causes serious and potentially fatal inflammatory diseases 
of the colon. Two large protein toxins, TcdA and TcdB, have been clearly 
implicated in pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine whether the 
glucosyltransferase activity of the toxins is critical for the induction of 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an important cytokine mediating both 
local and systematic inflammatory response. A dose-dependent TNF-alpha secretion 
was demonstrated in murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 after exposure to TcdA 
or TcdB. TNF-alpha production was blocked by anti-toxin antibodies, indicating 
that the cytokine-driven response is mediated by the toxins. Both toxins 
disrupted the cytoskeleton of host cells, while cytoskeleton disruptions using 
Cytochalasin-D and latrunculin B did not affect TNF-alpha production. The 
TNF-alpha synthesis was inhibited by reagents that target clathrin-dependent 
endocytosis or prevent endosomal acidification, suggesting that the endocytosis 
pathway is necessary for the induction of TNF-alpha. Furthermore, knockout of 
the enzymatic activity by mutating two key amino acids in the catalytic domain 
of TcdA abolished its cytokine-inducing activity. Our studies demonstrated a 
crucial role of the glucosyltransferase activity of C. difficile toxins in the 
induction of TNF-alpha in macrophages.
