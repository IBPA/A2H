Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated nosocomial 
diarrhea in the developed world. When the host-associated colon microbiome is 
disrupted by the ingestion of antibiotics, C. difficile spores can germinate, 
resulting in infection. C. difficile secretes enterotoxin A (TcdA) and cytotoxin 
B (TcdB) that are responsible for disease pathology. Treatment options are 
limited as the bacterium demonstrates resistance to many antibiotics, and even 
with antibacterial therapies, recurrences of C. difficile are common. 
Actotoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies that bind and 
neutralize TcdA and TcdB, respectively. In 2016, the US food and drug 
administration (FDA) approved bezlotoxumab for use in the prevention of C. 
difficile infection recurrence. To ensure the long-term expression of 
antibodies, gene therapy can be used. Here, adeno-associated virus (AAV)6.2FF, a 
novel triple mutant of AAV6, was engineered to express either actotoxumab or 
bezlotoxumab in mice and hamsters. Both antibodies expressed at greater than 
90 μg/mL in the serum and were detected at mucosal surfaces in both models. 
Hundred percent of mice given AAV6.2FF-actoxumab survived a lethal dose of TcdA. 
This proof of concept study demonstrates that AAV-mediated expression of C. 
difficile toxin antibodies is a viable approach for the prevention of recurrent 
C. difficile infections.
