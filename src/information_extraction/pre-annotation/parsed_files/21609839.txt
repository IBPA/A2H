Nosocomial infections with the Gram-positive pathogen Clostridium difficile pose 
a major risk for hospitalized patients and result in significant costs to health 
care systems. Here, we present the chemical synthesis of a PS-II hapten of a 
cell wall polysaccharide of hypervirulent ribotype 027 of C. difficile. Mice 
were immunized with a conjugate consisting of the synthetic hexasaccharide and 
the diphtheria toxoid variant CRM(197). The immunogenicity of the glycan 
repeating unit was demonstrated by the presence of specific IgG antibodies in 
the serum of immunized mice. Murine monoclonal antibodies interact with the 
synthetic hexasaccharide, as determined by microarray analysis. Finally, we 
found that specific IgA antibodies in the stool of hospital patients infected 
with C. difficile recognize the synthetic PS-II hexasaccharide hapten.
