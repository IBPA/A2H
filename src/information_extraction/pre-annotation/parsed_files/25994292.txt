Bifidobacteria constitute a significant part of healthy intestinal microbiota in 
adults and infants and present a promising platform for construction of 
genetically modified probiotic agents for treatment of gastrointestinal 
disorders. In this study, three strains of Bifidobacterium longum were 
constructed that express and secrete biologically active single-chain antibodies 
against human TNF-α and Clostridium difficile exotoxin A. Anti-TNF-α scFv 
antibody D2E7 was produced at the level of 25 μg L(-1) in broth culture and was 
mostly retained in the cytoplasm, while VHH-type antibodies A20.1 and A26.8 
against C. difficile exotoxin A were produced at the levels of 0.3-1 mg L(-1) 
and secreted very efficiently. The biological activity of both antibody types 
was demonstrated in the mammalian cell-based assays. Expression of A20.1 and 
A26.8 was also observed in vivo after intragastric administration of transformed 
B. longum strains to (C57/BL6 × DBA/2)F1 mice. The obtained B. longum strains 
may serve as prototypes for construction of novel probiotic medications against 
inflammatory bowel disease and C. difficile-associated disease.
