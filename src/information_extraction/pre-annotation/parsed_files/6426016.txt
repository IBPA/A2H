Two toxins were isolated from a toxigenic strain of Clostridium difficile. The 
toxins were purified by gel filtration and ion-exchange column chromatography to 
homogeneity as judged from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were 
designated D-1 and D-2. Toxin D-1 was lethal for mice, increased vascular 
permeability, and induced fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops, and 
toxin D-2 displayed cytotoxicity in HeLa cells with a minimum of 1 pg of toxin. 
The molecular weights of toxins D-1 and D-2, as estimated by gel filtration, 
ranged from 550,000 to 600,000 and from 450,000 to 500,000, respectively. These 
toxins were heat labile and inactivated by pronase and trypsin. Amino acid 
analyses of both toxins showed them to be of relatively similar composition. 
Antisera prepared against purified toxin D-1 neutralized all of the biologic 
activities of toxin D-1, whereas it did not affect any of the biologic 
activities of toxin D-2. A sensitive latex-agglutination immunoassay was 
developed for screening for C. difficile toxin D-1 in patients with 
pseudomembranous colitis.
