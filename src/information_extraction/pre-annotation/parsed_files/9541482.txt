Toxin A, a 308,000-Mr enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, mediates 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in humans. Injection of toxin A into 
animal intestine triggers an acute inflammatory response characterized by 
activation of sensory neurons and immune cells of the intestinal lamina propria, 
including mast cells and macrophages, and migration of circulating neutrophils 
in the involved intestinal segment. In this study we show that mice genetically 
deficient in the neurokinin-1 receptor are protected from the secretory and 
inflammatory changes as well as from epithelial cell damage induced by toxin A. 
The protective effect of neurokinin-1R deletion correlates with diminished 
intestinal levels of the cytokine TNF-alpha and its mRNA and the leukocyte 
enzyme myeloperoxidase. These results demonstrate a major requirement for 
substance P receptors in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory diarrhea.
