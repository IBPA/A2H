In order to investigate the regulation of presynaptic phospholipase D (PLD) 
activity by calcium and G proteins, we established a permeabilization procedure 
for rat cortical synaptosomes using Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin (30-100 
microg/ml). In permeabilized synaptosomes, PLD activity was significantly 
stimulated when the concentration of free calcium was increased from 0.1 microM 
to 1 microM. This activation was inhibited in the presence of KN-62 (1 microM), 
an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), but not by the 
protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro 31-8220 (1-10 microM). Synaptosomal PLD activity 
was also stimulated in the presence of 1 microM GTPgammaS. When Rho proteins 
were inhibited by pretreatment of the synaptosomes with Clostridium difficile 
toxin B (TcdB; 1-10 ng/ml), the effect of GTPgammaS was significantly reduced; 
in contrast, brefeldin A (10-100 microM), an inhibitor of ARF activation, was 
ineffective. Calcium stimulation of PLD was inhibited by TcdB, but 
GTPgammaS-dependent activation was insensitive to KN-62. We conclude that 
synaptosomal PLD is activated in a pathway which sequentially involves CaMKII 
and Rho proteins.
