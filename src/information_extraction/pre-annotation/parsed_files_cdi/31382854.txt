Clostridium difficile is a well-documented cause of enterocolitis in several 
species, including humans, with limited documentation in New World nonhuman 
primates. We report several cases of C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous 
enterocolitis, including a case in a Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) 
and several cases in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The histologic 
lesions included a spectrum of severity, with most cases characterized by the 
classic "volcano" lesions described in humans and several other animal species. 
C. difficile was isolated from the colon of the spider monkey, while the 
presence of toxin A or toxin B or of the genes of toxin A or B by polymerase 
chain reaction served as corroborative evidence in several affected marmosets. 
C. difficile should be considered a cause of enterocolitis in these species.
