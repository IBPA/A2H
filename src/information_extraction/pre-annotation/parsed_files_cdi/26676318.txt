Clostridium difficile is an emerging enteropathogen responsible for 
pseudomembranous colitis in humans and diarrhoea in several domestic and wild 
animal species. Despite its known importance, there are few studies about C. 
difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotypes in Brazil and the actual 
knowledge is restricted to studies on human isolates. The aim of the study was 
therefore to compare C. difficile ribotypes isolated from humans and animals in 
Brazil. Seventy-six C. difficile strains isolated from humans (n = 25), dogs (n 
= 23), piglets (n = 12), foals (n = 7), calves (n = 7), one cat, and one manned 
wolf were distributed into 24 different PCR ribotypes. Among toxigenic strains, 
PCR ribotypes 014/020 and 106 were the most common, accounting for 14 (18.4%) 
and eight (10.5%) samples, respectively. Fourteen different PCR ribotypes were 
detected among human isolates, nine of them have also been identified in at 
least one animal species. PCR ribotype 027 was not detected, whereas 078 were 
found only in foals. This data suggests a high diversity of PCR ribotypes in 
humans and animals in Brazil and support the discussion of C. difficile as a 
zoonotic pathogen.
