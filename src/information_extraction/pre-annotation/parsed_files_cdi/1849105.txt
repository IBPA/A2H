In vivo, Clostridium difficile acts by releasing 2 toxins: toxin A, an 
enterotoxin, and toxin B, a cytotoxin. This study was performed to determine: a) 
whether the rat epithelial intestinal cell line IRD 98 responds to Clostridium 
difficile toxin A and B; b) whether the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii has an 
effect on this model. Evaluation of 3H-thymidine incorporation into IRD 98 cells 
exposed to toxin B revealed that DNA synthesis was inhibited for low 
concentrations (10 ng/ml). For higher concentrations, DNA synthesis was not 
modified. Evaluation of 14C-leucine incorporation into IRD 98 cells exposed to 
toxin B revealed that this toxin affected protein synthesis. Whereas cholera 
toxin stimulates adenylate cyclase in IRD 98 cells, cAMP levels in cells exposed 
to various quantities of toxin A was similar to that in control cells. As 
opposed to cholera toxin, which does not affect the cytoskeletal structure of 
IRD 98 cells, 7 micrograms/ml of toxin A and even smaller amounts of toxin B (1 
ng/ml) were found to cause structural alterations by immunofluorescence studies. 
Prior exposition of cells to Saccharomyces boulardii reduced or prevented the 
rounding of cells in the presence of these toxins. IRD 98 cells can thus be 
considered a good model for in vitro investigation of the effects of Clostridium 
difficile toxins A and B, and findings suggest that Saccharomyces boulardii has 
a protective effect against the action of these toxins.
