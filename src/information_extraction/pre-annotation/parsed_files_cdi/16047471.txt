The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Clostridium difficile 
toxin A (TxA) on intestinal epithelial cell migration, apoptosis, and 
transepithelial resistance and to evaluate the effect of glutamine (Gln) and its 
stable derivative, alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gln), on TxA-induced damage. Migration 
was measured in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) 6 and 24 hr after a 
razor scrape of the cell monolayer. Cell proliferation was indirectly measured 
utilizing the tetrazolium salt WST-1. The cells were incubated with TxA (1-100 
ng/ml) in medium without Gln or medium containing Gln or Ala-Gln (1-30 mM). 
Apoptosis was quantified in IEC-6 cells using annexin V assay. Transepithelial 
resistance was measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter across T84 cells seeded 
on a transwell filter. TxA-induced a dose-dependent reduction of migration and 
also caused dose and time-dependent apoptosis in IEC-6 cells. Gln and Aln-Gln 
significantly enhanced IEC-6 cell migration and proliferation. Gln and Ala-Gln 
also prevented the inhibition of migration, apoptosis, and the initial drop in 
transepithelial resistance induced by TxA. In conclusion, both peptides reduced 
toxin-induced epithelial damage and thus might play an adjunctive role in C. 
difficile-induced colitis therapy.
