Enterotoxin A is one of the major virulence factors of Clostridium difficile, 
and the causative agent of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In 
cell culture (NIH-3T3, rat basophilic leukemia cells) toxin A inhibits 
Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 (C3)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation 
of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Rho participates in the 
regulation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. Decrease in ADP-ribosylation of 
Rho occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and precedes the toxin 
A-induced destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Action of toxin A is not due to 
proteolytical degradation of Rho or to an inherent ADP-ribosyltransferase 
activity of toxin A. Toxin A-induced decrease in ADP-ribosylation is observed 
also in cell lysates and with recombinant RhoA protein. A heat stable low 
molecular mass cytosolic factor is essential for the toxin effect on Rho. Thus, 
the enterotoxin (toxin A) resembles the effects of the C. difficile cytotoxin 
(toxin B) on Rho proteins (Just, I., G. Fritz, K. Aktories, M. Giry, M. R. 
Popoff, P. Boquet, S. Hegenbath, and C. Von Eichel-Streiber. 1994. J. Biol. 
Chem. 269:10706-10712). The data indicate that despite different in vivo 
effects, toxin A and toxin B act on the same cellular target protein Rho to 
elicit their toxic effects.
