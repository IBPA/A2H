Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore former, and an 
important nosocomial pathogenic bacterium. C. difficile spores are the 
morphotype of transmission and recurrence of the disease. The formation of 
C. difficile spores and their subsequent germination are essential processes 
during the infection. Recent in vitro and in vivo work has shed light on how 
spores are formed and the timing of in vivo sporulation in a mouse model. 
Advances have also been made in our understanding of the machineries involved in 
spore germination, and how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis affects the metabolism 
of bile salts and thus impacts C. difficile germination in vivo. Studies have 
also attempted to identify how C. difficile spores interact with the host's 
intestinal mucosa. Spore resistance has also been revisited by several groups 
highlighting the extreme resistance of this morphotype to traditional food 
processing regimes and disinfectants used in clinical settings. Therefore, the 
aim of this review is to summarize recent advances on spore 
formation/germination in vitro and in vivo, spore-host interactions, and spore 
resistance that contribute to our knowledge of the role of C. difficile spores 
in the infectious process.
