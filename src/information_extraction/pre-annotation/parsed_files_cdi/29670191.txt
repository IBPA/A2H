Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is now widely used to treat recurrent 
Clostridium difficile infection, but has been less studied as a means to restore 
microbiome diversity and composition following antibiotic or chemotherapy 
treatments. The purpose of our study was to assess the efficacy of FMT to 
reverse antibiotic- and chemotherapy-induced gut dysbiosis in a mouse model. 
C57BL/6J mice were treated with ampicillin for 1 week and/or received a single 
intraperitoneal injection of 5-Fluorouracil. Fresh stool was collected and 
analyzed using shotgun metagenomics and the Illumina sequencing platform. 
Ampicillin caused a significant and immediate decrease in bacterial species 
richness and diversity that persisted for one week. In mice that received FMT, 
disruption of the intestinal microbiota was reversed immediately. Antibiotic and 
chemotherapy administration caused significant alteration in species 
distribution, including a decrease in the relative proportions of Clostridium 
scindens and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and an increase in known pathogenic 
species. In mice receiving FMT, we observed a significant increase in species 
known to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, chemotherapy led to a 
critical decrease in key 'health-promoting' species and to an altered functional 
profile, especially when chemotherapy was administered in tandem with 
antibiotics, and that FMT can ameliorate these effects.
