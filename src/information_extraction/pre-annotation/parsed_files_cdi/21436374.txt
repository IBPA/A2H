Clostridium difficile strains of toxinotypes III (n = 13) and V (n = 45) were 
typed by agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping, capillary gel electrophoresis-based 
PCR ribotyping and PFGE using two different restriction enzymes, SmaI and SacII. 
With conventional agarose gel-based PCR ribotyping, toxinotype III strains were 
distributed among six different PCR ribotypes and toxinotype V strains into 
three different PCR ribotypes. Capillary gel electrophoresis-based ribotyping 
was more discriminatory for toxinotype V strains, with six different ribotypes 
found. With PFGE using SmaI, all toxinotype III strains grouped together into a 
single pulsotype. Using SacII, ribotype 027 strains grouped together with >90 % 
similarity and were <83 % similar to other ribotypes of toxinotype III strains. 
Within ribotype 078, seven (SmaI) and eight (SacII) different pulsotypes were 
found, whilst ribotype 126 strains belonged to one (SmaI) and two (SacII) 
pulsotypes. Within ribotype 066, it was possible to distinguish between pig and 
human isolates. Using SacII, a further distinction could also be made between 
pig isolates from two different farms. PFGE (SmaI and SacII) clustered strains 
according to their toxinotype; however, correlation of PFGE and ribotyping was 
better with SacII. These data suggest that toxinotype III strains are a more 
heterogeneous group than toxinotype V strains and that SacII is more 
discriminatory than SmaI. Alternatively, the use of both enzymes simultaneously 
could improve PFGE typing of C. difficile.
