BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces boulardii is a nonpathogenic yeast used for the 
prevention and treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and 
colitis. However, the mechanism by which S. boulardii exerts its protective 
effects remains unclear.
METHODS: The binding of [3H]toxin A to its brush border receptor preincubated 
with S. boulardii-cultured suspension or filtered conditioned medium was 
measured in vitro. The effect of toxin A on secretion, epithelial permeability, 
and morphology in rat ileal loops in vivo was also examined in rats pretreated 
with S. boulardii.
RESULTS: S. boulardii reduced [3H]toxin A-receptor binding in a dose-dependent 
fashion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of ileal 
brush border exposed to S. boulardii-conditioned medium revealed a diminution of 
all brush border proteins. Treatment of rats with S. boulardii suspension 
reduced fluid secretion and mannitol permeability caused by toxin A.
CONCLUSIONS: S. boulardii may reduce some of the enterotoxic effects of toxin A 
by inhibiting toxin A-receptor binding. This effect appears to be manifested by 
a secreted product of the yeast, possibly a protease.
