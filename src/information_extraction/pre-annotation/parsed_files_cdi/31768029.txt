Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is a leading cause of 
healthcare-associated infections. Although considerable progress has been made 
in the understanding of its genome, the epigenome of C. difficile and its 
functional impact has not been systematically explored. Here, we perform a 
comprehensive DNA methylome analysis of C. difficile using 36 human isolates and 
observe a high level of epigenomic diversity. We discovered an orphan DNA 
methyltransferase with a well-defined specificity, the corresponding gene of 
which is highly conserved across our dataset and in all of the approximately 300 
global C. difficile genomes examined. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene 
negatively impacts sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, 
and these results are consistently supported by multiomics data, genetic 
experiments and a mouse colonization model. Further experimental and 
transcriptomic analyses suggest that epigenetic regulation is associated with 
cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization. These findings provide a 
unique epigenetic dimension to characterize medically relevant biological 
processes in this important pathogen. This study also provides a set of methods 
for comparative epigenomics and integrative analysis, which we expect to be 
broadly applicable to bacterial epigenomic studies.
