The cecal flora of mice is able to eliminate Clostridium difficile from the 
mouse cecum even when C. difficile is the first organism established. We used a 
continuous-flow (CF) culture model of the cecal flora to investigate the 
possibility that competition for nutrients is one mechanism for this antagonism. 
The medium for the CF cultures consisted of homogenates of fecal pellets from 
germfree mice. Carbohydrate analysis showed that mouse flora depleted 74 to 
99.8% of the various carbohydrates from this environment-simulating medium. When 
inoculated into filtrates made from CF cultures of mouse flora, C. difficile 
multiplied slower than the dilution rate of the CF cultures unless glucose, 
N-acetylglucosamine, or N-acetylneuraminic acid was added. C. difficile did not 
synthesize hydrolytic enzymes able to cleave these monosaccharides from 
oligosaccharide side chains. As found previously, veal infusion broth did not 
support the growth of a microflora that could be transferred to gnotobiotic mice 
and fully suppress C. difficile. When mucin or monosaccharides found in mucin 
were added to veal infusion broth, the flora functioned normally in this regard. 
These data suggest that as yet unidentified organisms compete more efficiently 
than C. difficile for monomeric glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acids 
found in colonic contents.
