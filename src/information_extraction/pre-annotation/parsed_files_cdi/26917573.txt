BACKGROUND: The elderly host is highly susceptible to severe disease and 
treatment failure in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We investigated how 
treatment with vancomycin in the aged host influences systemic and intestinal 
humoral responses and select intestinal microbiota.
METHODS: Young (age, 2 months) and aged (age, 18 months) C57BL/6 mice were 
infected with VPI 10463 after exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Vancomycin 
was given 24 hours after infection, and treatment was continued for 5 days. At 
select time points, specimens of serum and intestinal tissue and contents were 
collected for histopathologic analysis, to measure antibody levels and the 
pathogen burden, and to determine the presence and levels of select intestinal 
microbiota and C. difficile toxin.
RESULTS: Levels of disease severity, relapse, and mortality were increased, and 
recovery from infection was slower in aged mice compared to young mice. Serum 
levels of immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin G against C. 
difficile toxin A were depressed in aged mice, and vancomycin treatment reduced 
antibody responses in both age groups. While baseline levels of total bacterial 
load, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Enterobacteriaceae were mostly similar, 
aged mice had a significant change in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio with 
vancomycin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin treatment decreases the systemic humoral response to 
CDI. Increased mortality from and recurrence of CDI in the aged host are 
associated with an impaired humoral response and a greater susceptibility to 
vancomycin-induced alteration of intestinal microbiota.
