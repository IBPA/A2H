In vitro and in vivo adhesive properties of flagella and recombinant flagellin 
FliC and flagellar cap FliD proteins of Clostridium difficile were analyzed. 
FliC, FliD, and crude flagella adhered in vitro to axenic mouse cecal mucus. 
Radiolabeled cultured cells bound to a high degree to FliD and weakly to 
flagella deposited on a membrane. The tissue association in the mouse cecum of a 
nonflagellated strain was 10-fold lower than that of a flagellated strain 
belonging to the same serogroup, confirming the role of flagella in adherence.
