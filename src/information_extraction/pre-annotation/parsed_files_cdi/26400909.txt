Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a worldwide health threat that is 
typically triggered by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the 
natural gut microbiota and allow this Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen to 
thrive. The increased incidence and severity of disease coupled with decreased 
response, high recurrence rates, and emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant 
strains have created an urgent need for new therapies. We describe 
pharmacological targeting of the cysteine protease domain (CPD) within the C. 
difficile major virulence factor toxin B (TcdB). Through a targeted screen with 
an activity-based probe for this protease domain, we identified a number of 
potent CPD inhibitors, including one bioactive compound, ebselen, which is 
currently in human clinical trials for a clinically unrelated indication. This 
drug showed activity against both major virulence factors, TcdA and TcdB, in 
biochemical and cell-based studies. Treatment in a mouse model of CDI that 
closely resembles the human infection confirmed a therapeutic benefit in the 
form of reduced disease pathology in host tissues that correlated with 
inhibition of the release of the toxic glucosyltransferase domain (GTD). Our 
results show that this non-antibiotic drug can modulate the pathology of disease 
and therefore could potentially be developed as a therapeutic for the treatment 
of CDI.
