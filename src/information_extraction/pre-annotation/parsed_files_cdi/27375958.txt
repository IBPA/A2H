Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in the 
United States, adding billions of dollars per year to health care costs. A 
vaccine targeted against the bacterium would be extremely beneficial in 
decreasing the morbidity and mortality caused by C. difficile-associated 
disease; a vaccine directed against a colonization factor would hinder the 
spread of the bacterium as well as prevent disease. Type IV pili (T4Ps) are 
extracellular appendages composed of protein monomers called pilins. They are 
involved in adhesion and colonization in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea, 
and are putative colonization factors in C. difficile. We hypothesized that 
vaccinating mice with pilins would lead to generation of anti-pilin antibodies, 
and would protect against C. difficile challenge. We found that immunizing 
C57Bl/6 mice with various pilins, whether combined or as individual proteins, 
led to low anti-pilin antibody titers and no protection upon C. difficile 
challenge. Passive transfer of anti-pilin antibodies led to high serum 
anti-pilin IgG titers, but to undetectable fecal anti-pilin IgG titers and did 
not protect against challenge. The low antibody titers observed in these 
experiments may be due to the particular strain of mice used. Further 
experiments, possibly with a different animal model of C. difficile infection, 
are needed to determine if an anti-T4P vaccine would be protective against C. 
difficile infection.
