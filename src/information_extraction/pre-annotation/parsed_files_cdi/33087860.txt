Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are powerful modulators of microbiota 
composition and function. These substrates are often derived from diet, such as 
complex polysaccharides from plants or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) during 
breastfeeding. Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve 
as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we 
investigate the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in 
maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and 
purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy 
in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found 
that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar 
resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after 
antibiotic treatment, suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset 
of diet-induced obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident 
Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with 
mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare 
in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being 
selected for during host development and throughout the evolution of the 
host-microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel 
class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the 
microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.
