Complete toxigenicity studies were performed on 341 strains of Campylobacter 
spp., including 23 nonhuman isolates. Toxin profiles based on both cytotonic and 
cytotoxic factors were determined after analyzing responses in Vero, HeLa, CHO 
and Y-1 cells. Suckling mouse assays were consistently negative for all culture 
filtrates tested. Toxin-producing strains were frequently encountered among both 
the human and nonhuman strains of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and C. laridis 
investigated. Strains isolated from outbreaks demonstrated parallels in 
serotype, biotype, and toxigenicity profile, although no clear association could 
be demonstrated. Biphasic culture conditions conducive to the production of both 
toxic factors were delineated for the propagation of test Campylobacter strains. 
Cytotonic effects of Campylobacter culture filtrates were determined in Vero and 
CHO cells, and cyclic AMP accumulation in cells exposed to these culture 
filtrates was compared with that in cells exposed to reference toxigenic strains 
of Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli. Partial neutralization of C. jejuni 
enterotoxin was demonstrated by using antitoxins to cholera toxin and E. coli 
heat-labile enterotoxin. No neutralization of C. jejuni cytotoxin could be 
achieved by using antitoxins to either Clostridium difficile cytotoxin or E. 
coli Verotoxin (0157:H7).
