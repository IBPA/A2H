Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) symptoms range from diarrhea to severe 
toxic megacolon and even death. Due to its rapid acquisition of resistance, 
C. difficile is listed as an urgent antibiotic-resistant threat, and has 
surpassed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the most common 
hospital-acquired infection in the USA. To combat this pathogen, a new 
structural class of pseudo-peptides that exhibit antimicrobial activities could 
play an important role. Herein we report a set of bis-cyclic guanidine compounds 
that show potent antibacterial activity against C. difficile with decent 
selectivity. Eight compounds showed high in vitro potency against C. difficile 
UK6 with MIC values of 1.0 μg mL-1 , and cytotoxic selectivity index (SI) values 
up to 37. Moreover, the most selective compound is also effective in the 
treatment of C. difficile-induced disease in a mouse model of CDI, and appears 
to be a very promising new candidate for the treatment of CDI.
