TNP-2092 is a unique multitargeting drug conjugate with extremely low propensity 
for development of resistance. The in vitro activity of TNP-2092 against a panel 
of urease-producing bacteria was similar to that of rifaximin, a locally acting 
antibiotic approved for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, irritable bowel 
syndrome with diarrhea, and traveler's diarrhea. When given orally, TNP-2092 
exhibited low absorption and the majority of compound was recovered in feces as 
parent. The impact of oral TNP-2092 on gut microbiota was investigated in rats. 
TNP-2092 was administered to rats by oral gavage for 7 days. Feces samples were 
collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Although the total amount of 
bacterial load appeared relatively unchanged before, during, and after 
treatment, significant changes in the relative abundance of certain gut bacteria 
at family and genus levels were observed. Some of the changes are known to be 
associated with improvement of symptoms associated with liver cirrhosis and 
hepatic encephalopathy. The observed effects of TNP-2092 on gut microbiota in 
rats were similar to those of rifaximin. In vivo, TNP-2092 demonstrated potent 
efficacy in a mouse Clostridium difficile infection model, superior to 
metronidazole and vancomycin, with no relapse observed after treatment. TNP-2092 
is currently in clinical development for the treatment of symptoms associated 
with gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
