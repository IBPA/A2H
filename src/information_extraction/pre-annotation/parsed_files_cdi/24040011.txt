Infections caused by Clostridium difficile have increased steadily over the past 
several years. While studies on C. difficile virulence and physiology have been 
hindered, in the past, by lack of genetic approaches and suitable animal models, 
newly developed technologies and animal models allow these processes to be 
studied in detail. One such advance is the generation of a mouse-model of C. 
difficile infection. The development of this system is a major step forward in 
analyzing the genetic requirements for colonization and infection. While 
important, it is equally as important in understanding what differences exist 
between mice and humans. One of these differences is the natural bile acid 
composition. Bile acid-mediated spore germination is an important step in C. 
difficile colonization. Mice produce several different bile acids that are not 
found in humans. These muricholic acids have the potential to impact C. 
difficile spore germination. Here we find that the three muricholic acids 
(α-muricholic acid, β-muricholic acid and ω-muricholic acid) inhibit C. 
difficile spore germination and can impact the growth of vegetative cells. These 
results highlight an important difference between humans and mice and may have 
an impact on C. difficile virulence in the mouse-model of C. difficile 
infection.
