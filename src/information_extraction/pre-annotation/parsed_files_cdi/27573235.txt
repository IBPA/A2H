Gastrointestinal (GI) leakage in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea 
(CDAD) is well known but is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. Serum 
(1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG), a fungal cell wall component used as a biomarker for 
invasive fungal disease, was tested in a CDAD mouse model with and without 
probiotics. Higher serum fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) and 
spontaneous gram-negative bacteremia, GI leakage indicators, were frequently 
found in CDAD mice, which died compared with those which survived. BG, serum 
macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and FITC-dextran but not quantitative blood 
bacterial count differentiated the clinical severity. Interestingly, a specific 
dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 attenuated CDAD and decreased serum BG and 
FITC-dextran, but not other parameters. BG also showed a higher area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve for 7-day mortality than FITC-dextran. 
Fifty-five percent of CDAD mice with BG ≥ 60 pg/ml (the human negative cut-off 
value for invasive fungal disease) at 1 day after C. difficile gavage died 
within 7 days. In conclusion, S: erum BG was elevated in mice with severe CDAD, 
an established model of GI leakage with a strong association with mortality 
rate. BG monitoring in patients with CDAD is of interest as both a potential 
prognostic tool and a therapeutic efficacy indicator.
