Clostridium difficile pathogenesis is mainly due to toxins A and B. However, the 
first step of pathogenesis is the colonization process. We evaluated C. 
difficile surface proteins as vaccine antigens to diminish intestinal 
colonization in a human flora-associated mouse model. First, we used the 
flagellar cap protein FliD of C. difficile, in order to test several 
immunization routes: intranasal, rectal, and intragastric. The rectal route, 
which is the most efficient, was used to vaccine groups of mice with different 
antigen combinations. After immunizations, the mice were challenged with the 
toxigenic C. difficile and a significant statistical difference between the 
control group and the immunized groups was observed in the colonization levels 
of C. difficile.
