Antibiotic treatment is often followed by Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), 
which causes severe diarrhea and other health issues. Oral administration of 
Pediococcus pentosaceus Li05 (Li05) has been shown to have great potential in 
preventing CDI. However, the viability of Li05 is greatly reduced during storage 
and passage through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which limits its biological 
activity. In this study, a gastro-responsive microgel was designed to 
encapsulate and protect Li05 to enhance its efficacy against CDI. The viability 
of Li05 encapsulated within the microgels was significantly enhanced during 
long-term storage and after exposure to simulated GI fluids. Moreover, this 
gastro-responsive microgel led to greater sustained release of the probiotic. In 
a mouse CDI model, we found that encapsulated Li05 was better at inhibiting C. 
difficile infection than nonencapsulated Li05, as demonstrated through analysis 
of the probiotic survival rate, spleen weight, colonic histology, and 
inflammatory cytokine levels. Moreover, the gut microbial diversity was enriched 
by treatment with encapsulated Li05. These results suggest that encapsulating 
Li05 within biopolymer microgels may enhance its ability to prevent and treat 
CDI using functional foods, supplements, or pharmaceuticals.
