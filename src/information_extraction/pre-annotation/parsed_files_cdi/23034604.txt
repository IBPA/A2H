One hypothesis for the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease is that an altered 
or pathogenic microbiota causes inflammation in a genetically susceptible 
individual. Understanding the microbiota's role in the pathogenesis of the 
disease could lead to new IBD treatments aimed at shifting the bacteria in the 
gut back to eubiosis. Probiotics have some efficacy in the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis (UC), but our current repertoire is limited in potency. Fecal 
microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal 
and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory 
Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully 
treating UC. Further clinical studies are justified, and could be complemented 
by mouse models of fecal transplantation, in which variables can be controlled 
and manipulated.
