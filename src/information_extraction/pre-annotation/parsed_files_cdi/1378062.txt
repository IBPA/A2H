Five mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Clostridium difficile toxin B 
have been raised and characterized. Three of them were immunoglobulin M (IgM) 
antibodies (6B10, 6G3, and 10B9), and the other two were of the IgG1 isotype 
(9E5 and 17G2), recognizing specifically two distinct epitopes on the toxin B 
molecule. No MAb was able to neutralize cytotoxic activity significantly. The 
two IgG1 MAbs were purified and applied to various immunodiagnostic assays. MAbs 
coupled to latex beads were used for specific removal of toxin B from cytotoxic 
samples and for agglutination assay. An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay with MAb 9E5 or 17G2 as the capture antibody was established 
for identification of toxin B with a lower detection limit of 5 ng/ml.
