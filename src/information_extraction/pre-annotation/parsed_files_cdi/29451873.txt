In this paper we study antibiotic-induced C. difficile infection (CDI), caused 
by the toxin-producing C. difficile (CD), and implement clinically-inspired 
simulated treatments in a computational framework that synthesizes a generalized 
Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model with SIR modeling techniques. The gLV model uses 
parameters derived from an experimental mouse model, in which the mice are 
administered antibiotics and subsequently dosed with CD. We numerically identify 
which of the experimentally measured initial conditions are vulnerable to CD 
colonization, then formalize the notion of CD susceptibility analytically. We 
simulate fecal transplantation, a clinically successful treatment for CDI, and 
discover that both the transplant timing and transplant donor are relevant to 
the the efficacy of the treatment, a result which has clinical implications. We 
incorporate two nongeneric yet dangerous attributes of CD into the gLV model, 
sporulation and antibiotic-resistant mutation, and for each identify relevant 
SIR techniques that describe the desired attribute. Finally, we rely on the 
results of our framework to analyze an experimental study of fecal transplants 
in mice, and are able to explain observed experimental results, validate our 
simulated results, and suggest model-motivated experiments.
