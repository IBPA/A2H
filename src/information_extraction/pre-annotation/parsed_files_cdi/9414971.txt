BACKGROUND: Antisecretory factor (AF) is a recently identified regulatory 
protein which inhibits the intestinal fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin.
AIMS: To test the effect of AF on: (a) inflammation and hypersecretion induced 
by toxin A from Clostridium difficile; and (b) morphological changes and 
hypersecretion induced by okadaic acid (the blue mussel toxin) in rat intestinal 
mucosa.
METHODS: Morphological changes and fluid accumulation were observed in 
intestinal loops challenged with 1 microgram of toxin A or 3 micrograms of 
okadaic acid administered before or after injection of 0.1 microgram of 
recombinant AF (rAF).
RESULTS: The cytotoxic and inflammatory reaction caused by toxin A was abolished 
after treatment with rAF given either intraveneously or intraluminally prior to 
the toxin or one hour after the toxin. The intestinal fluid response induced by 
toxin A and okadaic acid was reduced 55-80% by rAF. However, the characteristic 
increase in goblet cells at the tips of villi in the okadaic acid treated mucosa 
was not inhibited by rAF.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that AF might be involved in protection against 
inflammation and in counteracting dehydration caused by enterotoxins. Both 
effects are probably mediated via the enteric nervous system.
