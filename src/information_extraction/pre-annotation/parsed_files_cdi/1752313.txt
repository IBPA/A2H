Cats and dogs being treated at two veterinary clinics were investigated for 
gastrointestinal carriage of Clostridium difficile using selective solid and 
enrichment media. Thirty-two (39.5%) of 81 stool samples yielded C. difficile. 
There were significant differences in isolation rates between clinics, 61.0% of 
animals being positive at one clinic compared to 17.5% at the other (Chi-square, 
P less than 0.005). Of 29 animals receiving antibiotics, 15 (52.0%) harboured C. 
difficile while 11 (23.9%) of 46 animals not receiving antibiotics were positive 
(Chi-square, P less than 0.01). There was no difference in carriage rate between 
cats (38.1%) and dogs (40.0%). The environment at both veterinary clinics was 
surveyed for the presence of C. difficile. Fifteen of 20 sites at one clinic 
were positive compared to 6 of 14 sites at the other clinic. Both cytotoxigenic 
and noncytotoxigenic isolates of C. difficile were recovered from animals and 
environmental sites. These findings suggest that household pets may be a 
potentially significant reservoir of infection with C. difficile.
