Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the 
United States. The primary virulence factors are two homologous 
glucosyltransferase toxins, TcdA and TcdB, that inactivate host Rho-family 
GTPases. The glucosyltransferase activity has been linked to a "cytopathic" 
disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to the disruption of tight 
junctions and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TcdB is also a 
potent cytotoxin that causes epithelium necrotic damage through an NADPH oxidase 
(NOX)-dependent mechanism. We conducted a small molecule screen to identify 
compounds that confer protection against TcdB-induced necrosis. We identified an 
enrichment of "hit compounds" with a dihydropyridine (DHP) core which led to the 
discovery of a key early stage calcium signal that serves as a mechanistic link 
between TcdB-induced NOX activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production. Disruption of TcdB-induced calcium signaling (with both DHP and 
non-DHP molecules) is sufficient to ablate ROS production and prevent subsequent 
necrosis in cells and in a mouse model of intoxication.
