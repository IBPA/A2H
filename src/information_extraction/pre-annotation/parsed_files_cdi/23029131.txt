The impact of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) on healthcare is becoming 
increasingly recognized as it represents a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea. A 
rising number of CDI cases and outbreaks have been reported worldwide. Here, we 
developed the pig ileal-ligated loop model for semi-quantitative analysis 
comparing temporal differential proteomes in C. difficile following in vivo 
incubation with in vitro growth using isobaric tags for relative and absolute 
quantification (iTRAQ). Proteins retrieved from the in vitro cultures and the 
loop contents after 4, 8, and 12 h in vivo incubation were subjected to 
in-solution digestion, iTRAQ labeling, two-dimensional liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and statistical analyses. From a total 
of 1152 distinct proteins identified in this study, 705 proteins were available 
for quantitative measures at all time points in both biological and technical 
replicates; 109 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. With 
analysis of clusters of orthologous group and protein-protein network 
interactions, we identified the proteins that might play roles in adaptive 
responses to the host environment, hence enhancing pathogenicity during CDI. 
This report represents the quantitative proteomic analysis of C. difficile that 
demonstrates time-dependent protein expression changes under conditions that 
mimic in vivo infection and identifies potential candidates for diagnostic or 
therapeutic measures.
