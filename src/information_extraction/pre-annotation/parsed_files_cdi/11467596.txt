In this prospective study, feces of dogs with diarrhea were compared with feces 
of normal dogs for the presence of Clostridium difficile, C difficile toxins A 
and B, C perfringens, and C perfingens enterotoxin (CPE). C difficile toxins A, 
B, or both were present in feces of 18 of 87 (21%) dogs with diarrhea and 4 of 
55 (7%) normal dogs (P = 0.03), whereas CPE was present in the feces of 24 of 87 
(28%) dogs with diarrhea and 3 of 55 (5%) normal dogs (P = 0.01). C difficile 
was isolated from 2 of 87 (2%) dogs with diarrhea but was not isolated from the 
feces of 55 normal dogs, possibly because of poor survival of the organism in 
fecal samples. C perfringens was isolated from the feces of 23 of 24 (96%) 
CPE-positive dogs with diarrhea, 52 of 63 (83%) CPE-negative dogs with diarrhea, 
and 39 of 55 (71%) CPE-negative dogs with normal feces. No correlation was found 
between C perfringens spore number and the presence of CPE.
