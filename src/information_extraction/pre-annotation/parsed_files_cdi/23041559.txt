Faecal carriage of Clostridium difficile in healthy animals has been reported 
recently, especially in piglets and calves. However there is limited data about 
carriage in animals just prior to slaughter in Europe. The main objective of 
this study was to determine the presence of C. difficile in pigs and cattle at 
the slaughterhouse. C. difficile was isolated in 6.9% of the cattle at the 
slaughterhouse. None of the pig slaughter samples were positive for C. difficile 
after an enrichment time of 72 h. For complementary data, a short study was 
conducted in piglets and calves at farms. C. difficile was more prevalent in 
piglets (78.3%) than in calves (22.2%) on the farms. Regarding the piglet 
samples, 27.8% of the positive samples were detected without enrichment of 
stools. The PCR ribotype 078 was predominant in farm animals. Samples isolated 
from slaughter cattle presented the widest range in PCR-ribotype variety, and 
the most prevalent PCR ribotype was 118a UCL. The results of this study confirm 
that C. difficile is present in slaughter animals in Belgium with a large 
percentage of toxigenic strains also commonly found in humans.
