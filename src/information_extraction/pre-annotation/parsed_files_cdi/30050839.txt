The gastrointestinal tract of dogs, cats, and other mammals including humans 
harbors millions of beneficial microorganisms that regulate and maintain health. 
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving the 
administration of a fecal infusion from a healthy individual (donor) to a 
patient with disease to help improve health. Despite the effectiveness of FMT to 
treat intestinal disorders in humans, in particular recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infection, there is a paucity of scientific data regarding the 
application of FMT in veterinary patients. Here, we outline key aspects of FMT 
in small animal practice.
