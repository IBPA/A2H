Pigs, particularly piglets, have been identified as reservoir hosts of 
Clostridium difficile. To examine the survival ability of this pathogen in pig 
feces-based manure compost, C. difficile spores, which were prepared to contain 
as few vegetative cells as possible, were artificially inoculated into pig feces 
and incubated at different temperatures. While C. difficile survived in the 
feces incubated at temperatures below 37 °C for over 30 days, cell numbers 
gradually decreased at thermophilic temperatures (over 55 °C; p < 0.05). Next, 
to clarify the prevalence of C. difficile in field manure compost, we isolated 
and characterized C. difficile from the final products of manure compost 
products of 14 pig farms. A total of 11 C. difficile strains were isolated from 
5 of 14 (36% positive rate) samples tested. Of these 11 strains, 82% were 
toxigenic, with ribotype 078 being the most prevalent. Thus, the application of 
composted manure to land therefore poses a possible risk of C. difficile 
transfer to the food chain.
