Experimental transplantations of cadaver bone marrow (BMT) in beagle dogs were 
performed to evaluate the problems and potentials in a preclinical setting. The 
effectiveness of selective decontamination of the gut (SD) and gnotobiotic 
surveillance in preventing infections during longer aplastic periods was 
investigated. Three groups of dogs were compared. Group A: controls. Group B: 
dogs with BMT, without SD and irregular gnotobiotic surveillance. Group C: dogs 
with BMT, with SD and regular gnotobiotic surveillance. The intestinal 
colonization of normal healthy beagles shows similarities as well as 
dissimilarities to the human intestinal microflora. Aerobic potentially 
pathogenic organisms do not colonize the gut of healthy beagles under our 
keeping conditions. SD resulted in a significant decrease in infections with 
Escherichia coli and Plesiomonas. Infections with anaerobes, as well as 
bacterial infections of the respiratory tract were, however, not prevented. The 
intestinal colonization in dogs of group C with Clostridium difficile is another 
obvious effect of SD. The infections encountered during the study indicate the 
importance of the "take" for the clinical significance and outcome of intestinal 
colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms. In order to reduce the drug 
burden of BMT patients, we consider the elimination of routine SD after BMT not 
to be superior to gnotobiotic surveillance and germ-specific short term 
decontamination.
