Many reports have shown that crude extracts of the American cockroach have 
therapeutic effects on inflammation. In a previous study, our research group 
showed that an antimicrobial peptide (Periplanetasin-2) derived from the 
American cockroach via de novo transcriptome analysis inhibited apoptosis of 
human colonocytes and inflammatory responses of the mouse gut caused by 
Clostridium difficile toxin A. Here, we examined whether Periplanetasin-4 
(Peri-4), another antimicrobial peptide identified via de novo transcriptome 
analysis of the American cockroach, could also inhibit the various toxicities 
induced by C. difficile toxin A. We found that Peri-4 significantly reduced the 
cell viability loss and cell apoptosis caused by toxin A in vitro. Peri-4 also 
ameliorated the severe inflammatory responses seen in the toxin A-induced mouse 
enteritis model, rescuing the villus disruption and interleukin-6 production 
induced by luminal injection of toxin A into the mouse gut. Mechanistically, we 
found that Peri-4 could reduce toxin A-induced reactive oxygen species 
production to inhibit the activations of p38MAPK and p21Cip1/Waf1 , which are 
critical for the cell damages induced by toxin A. These results collectively 
suggest that the Peri-4 may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating toxin 
A-induced pseudomembranous colitis. Copyright © 2017 European Peptide Society
