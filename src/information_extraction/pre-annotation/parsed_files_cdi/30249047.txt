Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Clostridium difficile infection cause 
gastrointestinal (GI) distension and, in severe cases, toxic megacolon with risk 
of perforation and death. Herpesviruses have been linked to severe GI 
dilatation. MHV-68 is a model for human gamma herpesvirus infection inducing GI 
dilatation in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-deficient mice but is benign in wildtype 
mice. MHV-68 also causes lethal vasculitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in 
interferon gamma receptor-deficient (IFNγR-/-) mice, but GI dilatation has not 
been reported. In prior work the Myxomavirus-derived anti-inflammatory serpin, 
Serp-1, improved survival, reducing vasculitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in 
MHV-68-infected IFNγR-/- mice with significantly increased IL-10. IL-10 has been 
investigated as treatment for GI dilatation with variable efficacy. We report 
here that MHV-68 infection produces severe GI dilatation with inflammation and 
gut wall degradation in 28% of INFγR-/- mice. Macrophage invasion and smooth 
muscle degradation were accompanied by decreased concentrations of T helper 
(Th2), B, monocyte, and dendritic cells. Plasma and spleen IL-10 were 
significantly reduced in mice with GI dilatation, while interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and INFγ increased. Treatment 
of gamma herpesvirus-infected mice with exogenous IL-10 prevents severe GI 
inflammation and dilatation, suggesting benefit for herpesvirus-induced 
dilatation.
