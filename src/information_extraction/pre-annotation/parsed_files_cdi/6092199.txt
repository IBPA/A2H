An assay was devised to quantitate acute intestinal inflammation based on the 
assessment of myeloperoxidase activity. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme found in 
neutrophils and, in much smaller quantities, in monocytes and macrophages. 
Myeloperoxidase was solubilized with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and 
myeloperoxidase activity was measured with a dianisidine-H2O2 assay. In 
neutrophil suspensions, myeloperoxidase activity was directly related to cell 
number down to as few as 500 cells. Myeloperoxidase activity was assayed in two 
animal models of inflammation: acetic acid-induced colitis in rats and 
Clostridium difficile enterotoxin-induced enteritis in hamsters. In both models, 
the activity of myeloperoxidase solubilized from the inflamed tissue was 
directly proportional to the number of neutrophils seen in histologic sections. 
Histologic evaluation of neutrophil accumulation was performed by counting the 
number of neutrophils in a histologic section 0.18 mm long and 5 micron thick. 
In both animal models, myeloperoxidase activity was linearly related to 
neutrophil number from 400 and 4000 cells/mm. Myeloperoxidase activity from 
chronically inflamed colon, in which both neutrophils and histiocytes were 
present, was directly related to neutrophil content. Histiocytes did not 
contribute significantly to myeloperoxidase activity. The determination of 
myeloperoxidase activity in the intestine is a simple biochemical assay that can 
be used to quantitate inflammation.
