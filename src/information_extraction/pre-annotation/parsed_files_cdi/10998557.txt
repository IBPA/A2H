Clostridium difficile enteritis is caused by toxin A (TA) which stimulates 
substance P release and subsequent receptor activation. This receptor 
stimulation results in secretion, inflammation, and structural damage. However, 
it is unclear as to which subset of neurons is required to initiate substance P 
release following toxin stimulation. Five centimeter ileal segments were 
surgically denervated. After 10 days, three ileal loops were constructed in each 
rat: the denervated loop was injected intraluminally with 5 microg of TA and two 
intact loops were injected with TA or vehicle, respectively. Ileal secretion, 
myeloperoxidase activity, and histology were then assessed. Denervated ileal 
loops injected with TA had a 75% reduction in ileal secretion (P < 0.001), 92% 
reduction in myeloperoxidase activity (P < 0.01) and 96% reduction in histologic 
damage (P < 0.001) compared to innervated loops. There were no significant 
differences between the denervated loops injected with TA and those injected 
with vehicle. Extrinsic surgical denervation results in protection of ileal 
loops from TA enteritis. Furthermore, these results exclude the participation of 
intrinsic enteric nerves in TA-induced ileal damage. Finally, this suggests that 
extrinsic primary sensory neurons mediate the effects of intraluminal TA in the 
ileum.
