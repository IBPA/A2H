Currently, aldosterone is believed to be involved in the development of 
cardiovascular injury as a potential cardiovascular risk hormone. However, its 
exact cellular mechanisms remain obscure. This study was undertaken to examine 
the effect of aldosterone on superoxide production in cultured rat aortic 
endothelial cells with possible involvement of the small GTP-binding (G) protein 
Rac1. The aldosterone levels showed a time-dependent (6-24 h) and dose-dependent 
(10(-8) to 10(-6) m) increase in superoxide generation, whose effect was 
abolished by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eplerenone), Src inhibitor 
(PP2), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase 
inhibitor (apocynin). Aldosterone activated NADP(H) oxidase and Rac1, whose 
effects were abolished by eplerenone. The aldosterone-induced superoxide 
generation was abolished either by nonselective small G protein inhibitor 
(Clostridium difficile toxin A) or dominant-negative Rac1. Dominant-negative 
Rac1 also inhibited aldosterone-induced ACE gene expression. Thus, the present 
study is the first to demonstrate that aldosterone induces superoxide generation 
via mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated activation of NAD(P)H-oxidase and Rac1 
in endothelial cells, thereby contributing to the development of 
aldosterone-induced vascular injury.
