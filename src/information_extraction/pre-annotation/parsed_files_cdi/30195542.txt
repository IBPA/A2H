The presence and genetic diversity of Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens 
along the slaughtering process of pigs reared in a free-range system was 
assessed. A total of 270 samples from trucks, lairage, slaughter line and 
quartering were analyzed, and recovered isolates were toxinotyped and genotyped. 
C. difficile and C. perfringens were retrieved from 14.4% and 12.6% of samples, 
respectively. The highest percentage of positive samples for C. difficile was 
detected in trucks (80%) whereas C. perfringens was more prevalent in cecal and 
colonic samples obtained in the slaughter line (85% and 45%, respectively). C. 
difficile isolates (n = 105) were classified into 17 PCR ribotypes (including 
010, 078, and 126) and 95 AFLP genotypes. C. perfringens isolates (n = 85) 
belonged to toxinotypes A (94.1%) and C (5.9%) and were classified into 80 AFLP 
genotypes. The same genotypes of C. difficile and C. perfringens were isolated 
from different pigs and occasionally from environmental samples, suggesting a 
risk of contaminated meat products.
