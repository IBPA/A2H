Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of hospital- and 
antimicrobial-associated diarrhea in hospitalized humans however the role of C. 
difficile in diarrhea in dogs has not been defined. A prospective study of C. 
difficile colonization in dogs and cats was conducted in a veterinary teaching 
hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Rectal swabs were taken from patients upon 
admission to the ICU and every third day of hospitalization until discharge or 
death. C. difficile was isolated from 73/402 (18%) animals; 69% of isolates were 
toxigenic. Community-associated colonization was identified in 39/366 (11%) of 
animals that were sampled at the time of admission, while C. difficile was 
subsequently isolated from 27 of the remaining 327 (8.3%) animals that had a 
negative admission swab. C. difficile was isolated from seven other dogs during 
hospitalization, but the origin was unclear because the admission swab was not 
collected. Administration of antimicrobials prior to admission and 
administration of immunosuppressive drugs during hospitalization were risk 
factors for hospital-associated colonization (P=0.006, OR 4.05, 95% CI 
1.4-10.8). Acquisition of C. difficile during hospitalization in the ICU was 
associated with the development of diarrhea (P=0.004). Two ribotypes, one 
toxigenic and one non-toxigenic, predominated.
