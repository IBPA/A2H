A total of 70 puppies and their dams, distributed in 14 litters, were submitted 
to weekly fecal examinations for C. difficile during the first 10 weeks after 
birth. During the study, 94.3% of the puppies and 42.9% of the dams harboured C. 
difficile at least once in their feces. We calculated that 58% of the puppies 
carried toxigenic C. difficile at least once during the survey. In the puppies, 
C. difficile carriage rates ranging from 3.1% to 67.1% were observed at 
different moments of the observation period. In comparison, C. difficile 
carriage rate was 1.4% in a control group of healthy dogs more than 3 months 
old. Discrepancies in the toxigenic phenotype of the C. difficile strains 
isolated in the same litter showed that the neonate dogs were transiently 
infected with different strains, and that the dam is often not the source of 
infection with C. difficile. We could not demonstrate any pathogenicity of C. 
difficile for neonate dogs.
