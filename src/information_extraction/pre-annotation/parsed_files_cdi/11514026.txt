The mechanism by which Clostridium difficile toxin A causes substance P (SP) 
release and subsequent inflammation in the rat ileum is unknown. Pretreatment 
with the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonist, capsazepine, before 
toxin A administration significantly inhibited toxin A-induced SP release and 
intestinal inflammation. Intraluminal administration of the VR1 agonist 
capsaicin caused intestinal inflammation similar to the effects of toxin A. 
Pretreatment with capsazepine before capsaicin administration also significantly 
inhibited capsaicin-induced intestinal inflammation. These results suggest that 
intraluminal toxin A causes SP release from primary sensory neurons via 
stimulation of VR1 receptors resulting in intestinal inflammation.
