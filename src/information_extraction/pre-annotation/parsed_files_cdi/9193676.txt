The influence of different ADP-ribosylating and glucosylating cytotoxins on 
stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in rat basophilic 
leukemia (RBL) cells was studied. Treatment of RBL cells with Clostridium 
botulinum C2 toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylated monomeric G-actin and 
caused complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells, 
inhibited Fc epsilon RI receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of various 
proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects at 
100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2I. C2 toxin (10 ng/ml C2I and 20 ng/ml C2II) 
increased antigen- or calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated [3H]serotonin 
release maximally by about 3 fold. Clostridium botulinum C3, which 
ADP-ribosylated Rho in intact RBL cells, had no effect on protein tyrosine 
phosphorylation and stimulated secretion. In contrast, the cytotoxic Clostridium 
difficile toxin B (ToxB), which glucosylated the Rho-subtype family members RhoA 
and Cdc42, blocked or reduced antigen- or calcium ionophore-mediated 
[3H]serotonin release, respectively, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 
110 kDa protein. The data indicate that different actin pools control tyrosine 
phosphorylation and secretion in RBL cells and suggest that Rho subfamily 
proteins regulate secretion independently of the actin cytoskeleton.
