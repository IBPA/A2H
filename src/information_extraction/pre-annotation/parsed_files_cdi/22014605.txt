Clostridium difficile is increasingly recognized as an important enteropathogen 
in both humans and animals. The finding of C. difficile in air samples in 
hospitals suggests a role for aerial dissemination in the transmission of human 
C. difficile infection. The present study was designed to investigate the 
occurrence of airborne C. difficile in, and nearby a pig farm with a high 
prevalence of C. difficile. Airborne colony counts in the farrowing pens peaked 
on the moments shortly after or during personnel activity in the pens (P=0.043 
(farrowing pens 1, 2), P=0.034 (farrowing pen 2)). A decrease in airborne C. 
difficile colony counts was observed parallel to aging of the piglets. Airborne 
C. difficile was detected up to 20 m distant from the farm. This study showed 
widespread aerial dissemination of C. difficile on a pig farm that was 
positively associated with personnel activity.
