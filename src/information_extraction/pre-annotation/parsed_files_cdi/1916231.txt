Nine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to Clostridium difficile toxin A were produced. 
The isotype of one mAb (37B5) was IgG2b, kappa, and that of the other eight mAbs 
was IgM, kappa. Immunoblot analysis after non-denatured PAGE showed that with 
the exception of one mAb (112G6) all mAbs gave a positive reaction with the 540 
kDa band of toxin A. Immunoblot analysis showed that four mAbs (2E15, 3B4, 37B5 
and 49C4) gave a positive reaction with the 240 kDa major band of toxin A. In 
neutralisation tests with these mAbs for enterotoxicity, mouse lethality, 
haemagglutination activity and cytotoxicity, 37B5 neutralised enterotoxicity in 
a rabbit ileal loop response test but did not neutralise any other biological 
activities. None of the other eight mAbs showed any neutralising activities at 
all.
