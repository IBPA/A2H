We earlier showed that lovastatin potentiated the chemopreventive effects of 
sulindac against colon neoplasia in a rodent model and augments apoptosis 
induced by 5-FU and cisplatin in human colon cancer cells. In the present study, 
we investigated effects of lovastatin in spontaneously immortalized rat 
intestinal epithelial cells, IEC-18 and their K-ras transformed clones. 
Lovastatin induced morphologic changes (cell rounding and detachment) and 
apoptosis that were not influenced by K-ras mutations, but were prevented by 
geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate or by mevalonate. Clostridium difficile toxin B, 
which directly inactivates rho, induced similar morphologic changes and 
apoptosis. Cycloheximide prevented these effects of lovastatin, but not C. 
difficile toxin B. Lovastatin decreased the amounts of membrane bound rhoA and 
rhoB. Cycloheximide and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate prevented lovastatin 
induced morphologic changes and apoptosis but did not inhibit lovastatin-induced 
changes in membrane translocation of rho. Our data suggest that lovastatin 
induces morphologic changes and apoptosis by inhibiting geranylgeranylation of 
small GTPases of the rho family and thereby inactivating them. Restoration of 
membrane translocation of rho is not necessary for preventing lovastatin-induced 
morphologic changes or apoptosis.
