Different studies have suggested that the sand of public playgrounds could have 
a role in the transmission of infections, particularly in children. Furthermore, 
free access of pets and other animals to the playgrounds might increase such a 
risk. We studied the presence of Clostridium difficile in 20 pairs of sandboxes 
for children and dogs located in different playgrounds within the Madrid region 
(Spain). Clostridium difficile isolation was performed by enrichment and 
selective culture procedures. The genetic (ribotype and amplified fragment 
length polymorphism [AFLP]) diversity and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates 
was also studied. Overall, 52.5% (21/40) of samples were positive for the 
presence of C. difficile. Eight of the 20 available isolates belonged to the 
toxigenic ribotypes 014 (n = 5) and 106 (n = 2), both regarded as epidemic, and 
CD047 (n = 1). The other 12 isolates were non-toxigenic, and belonged to 
ribotypes 009 (n = 5), 039 (n = 4), and 067, 151 and CD048 (one isolate each). 
Nevertheless, all isolates (even those of a same ribotype) were classified into 
different AFLP genotypes indicating non-relatedness. In conclusion, our results 
revealed the presence of epidemic ribotypes of C. difficile in children's and 
dog's sandboxes located nearby, which constitutes a major health risk.
