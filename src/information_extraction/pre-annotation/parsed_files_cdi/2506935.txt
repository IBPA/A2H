The purification and characterization of three new proteins called C1, C2, and 
C3 from Clostridium difficile are described. Their estimated molecular mass were 
about 350 (C1), 270 (C2) and 140 (C3) kDa, consisting of subunits of 39 (C1), 43 
(C2) and 41 (C3) kDa, respectively. Immunodiffusion revealed that the three 
proteins contained similar but not identical antigenic determinants to toxin A. 
Each protein induced a cytotonic effect on hamster ovaric cells; the combined 
proteins, had a specific activity on cells 5-times higher than that of toxin A. 
In rat intestinal loops, they induced a clear fluid secretion, while toxin A 
elicited a haemorrhagic fluid response. The cytotonic activities of all three 
proteins were abolished by antiserum against toxin A, while antiserum against 
toxin B inhibited only the activity of the 270 kDa protein. In contrast to toxin 
A, the cytotoxicity of the three proteins was inactivated by trypsin. Thus, the 
chemical, antigenic and biological properties of these proteins differed from 
those of toxin A and toxin B.
