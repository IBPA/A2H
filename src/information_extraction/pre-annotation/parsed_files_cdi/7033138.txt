Antibiotic-associated enterocolitis was induced in guinea pigs by the 
intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin. The colonic and cecal mucosa and feces 
of acutely ill animals were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on 
5% sheep blood agar plates and on a selective and differential medium for 
Clostridium difficile. All morphologically distinct colony types were isolated 
in pure culture and identified. A sterile cell-free filtrate of each isolate was 
tested for ability to induce morphological changes in cultured monolayers of 
mouse adrenal cells. The filtrate of a predominant isolate, Bacillus pumilus, 
induced an alteration of cellular morphology; the sterile filtrate of other 
isolates were unreactive. Toxin contained in cell-free filtrates of B. pumilus 
caused a syndrome identical to clindamycin-associated enterocolitis when 
injected intracecally into guinea pigs. The toxin had a molecular weight of 
6,500 daltons as determined by molecular sieve chromatography and was 
inactivated with pronase, lipase, and trypsin. The minimal inhibitory 
concentrations of clindamycin and vancomycin for B. pumilus were 50 
micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms/ml, respectively.
