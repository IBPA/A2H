Clostridium difficile disease has recently increased to become a dominant 
nosocomial pathogen in North America and Europe, although little is known about 
what has driven this emergence. Here we show that two epidemic ribotypes (RT027 
and RT078) have acquired unique mechanisms to metabolize low concentrations of 
the disaccharide trehalose. RT027 strains contain a single point mutation in the 
trehalose repressor that increases the sensitivity of this ribotype to trehalose 
by more than 500-fold. Furthermore, dietary trehalose increases the virulence of 
a RT027 strain in a mouse model of infection. RT078 strains acquired a cluster 
of four genes involved in trehalose metabolism, including a PTS permease that is 
both necessary and sufficient for growth on low concentrations of trehalose. We 
propose that the implementation of trehalose as a food additive into the human 
diet, shortly before the emergence of these two epidemic lineages, helped select 
for their emergence and contributed to hypervirulence.
