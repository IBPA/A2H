Recent reports suggest increased incidence and severity of Clostridium 
difficile-associated diseases. These facts have raised the need for additional 
clarification of pathogenesis and for a search for new therapeutic strategies. 
This study evaluated the effects of the polysaccharide fucoidin, an L-selectin 
blocker, on toxin-A-induced mouse enteritis. Fucoidin (25 mg/kg) or saline (0.1 
ml) were injected systemically (ocular plexus) 5 min prior to local challenge 
with toxin A (5 microg/ileal loop) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 
Intestinal fluid volume/length and ileal loop weight/length ratios were 
calculated 3 h later. Ileal tissues were collected for histopathology and 
measurement of myeloperoxidase and adenosine deaminase activity. Fucoidin 
significantly (P < 0.05) prevented the toxin-A-induced increase in weight/length 
and volume/length ratios and reduced mucosal disruption, as shown in 
histopathology. Fucoidin also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced toxin-A-induced 
myeloperoxidase and adenosine deaminase activities. In conclusion, fucoidin 
reduces tissue injury and inflammation in toxin-A-induced mouse enteritis.
