Intestinal epithelial cell culture is important for biological, functional, and 
immunological studies. Since enterocytes have a short in vivo life span due to 
anoikis, we aimed to establish a novel and reproducible method to prolong the 
survival of mouse and human cells. Cells were isolated following a standard 
procedure, and cultured on ordered-cow's collagen membranes. A prolonged cell 
life span was achieved; cells covered the complete surface of bio-membranes and 
showed a classical enterocyte morphology with high expression of enzymes 
supporting the possibility of cryopreservation. Apoptosis was dramatically 
reduced and cultured enterocytes expressed cytokeratin and LGR5 (low frequency). 
Cells exposed to LPS or flagellin showed the induction of TLR4 and TLR5 
expression and a functional phenotype upon exposure to the probiotic 
Bifidobacterium bifidum or the pathogenic Clostridium difficile. The secretion 
of the homeostatic (IL-25 and TSLP), inhibitory (IL-10 and TGF-β), or 
pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNF) were induced. In conclusion, this 
novel protocol using cow's collagen-ordered membrane provides a simple and 
reproducible method to maintain intestinal epithelial cells functional for 
cell-microorganism interaction studies and stem cell expansion. J. Cell.
