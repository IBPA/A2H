Worldwide, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) carry a number of zoonotic pathogens. 
Many studies have identified rat-level risk factors for pathogen carriage. The 
objective of this study was to examine associations between abundance, 
microenvironmental and weather features and Clostridium difficile, 
antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage in urban rats. We assessed city blocks for 
rat abundance and 48 microenvironmental variables during a trap-removal study, 
then constructed 32 time-lagged temperature and precipitation variables and 
fitted multivariable logistic regression models. The odds of C. difficile 
positivity were significantly lower when mean maximum temperatures were high 
(≥ 12.89°C) approximately 3 months before rat capture. Alley pavement condition 
was significantly associated with AMR E. coli. Rats captured when precipitation 
was low (< 49.40 mm) in the 15 days before capture and those from blocks that 
contained food gardens and institutions had increased odds of testing positive 
for MRSA. Different factors were associated with each pathogen, which may 
reflect varying pathogen ecology including exposure and environmental survival. 
This study adds to the understanding of how the microenvironment and weather 
impacts the epidemiology and ecology of zoonotic pathogens in urban ecosystems, 
which may be useful for surveillance and control activities.
