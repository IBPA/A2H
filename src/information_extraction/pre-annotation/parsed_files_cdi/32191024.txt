Clostridiodes (Clostridium) difficile is an anaerobic Gram-positive, 
spore-forming nosocomial, gastrointestinal pathogen causing C. 
difficile-associated disease with symptoms ranging from mild cases of 
antibiotic-associated diarrhea to fatal pseudomembranous colitis. We developed 
murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for a conserved cell surface 
antigen, lipoteichoic acid (LTA)of C. difficile. The mAbs were characterized in 
terms of their thermal stability, solubility, and their binding to LTA by 
surface plasmon resonance and competitive ELISA. Synthetic LTA molecules were 
prepared in order to better define the minimum epitope required to mimic the 
natural antigen, and three repeat units of the polymer were required for optimal 
recognition. One of the murine mAbs was chimerized with human constant region 
domains and was found to recognize the target antigen identically to the mouse 
version. These mAbs may be useful as therapeutics (standalone, in conjunction 
with known antitoxin approaches, or as delivery vehicles for antibody drug 
conjugates targeting the bacterium), as diagnostic agents, and in infection 
control applications.
