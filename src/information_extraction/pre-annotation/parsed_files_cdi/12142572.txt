This study assessed the mechanism(s) by which the autoregulatory vasodilation of 
rat pial artery in response to acute hypotension during the acute phase of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was markedly blunted. Increased superoxide 
production from the cerebral vessels in response to NAD(P)H at 24 hours after 
SAH + NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (10 mg/kg) was inhibited by 
intracisternal administration of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (10 
micromol/L) and Rac inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B (1 ng/mL) and a 
flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (10 micromol/L). The expression of 
gp91phox was enhanced by SAH + l-NAME from 12 to 24 hours, which was inhibited 
by genistein and toxin B, but not the p22phox. Increased membrane translocation 
of Rac after SAH + l-NAME was attenuated by both genistein and toxin B, whereas 
increased tyrosine kinase activity was blocked by genistein, but not by toxin B. 
The blunted autoregulatory vasodilation to acute hypotension was effectively 
recovered by genistein and C. difficile toxin B as well as by 
diphenyleneiodonium. In conclusion, SAH during acute stage causes an increase in 
NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide formation in cerebral vessels, which is due 
to activation of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent increased expression of 
gp91phox mRNA and translocation of Rac protein, thereby resulting in a 
significant reduction of autoregulatory vasodilation.
