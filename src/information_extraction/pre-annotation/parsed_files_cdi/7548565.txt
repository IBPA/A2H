Clostridia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and 
animals. Some of the most common clostridial infections are those of the gut. 
The primary infections in humans are Clostridium perfringens food poisoning and 
Clostridium difficile-mediated antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. Less 
common but important infections include non-food poisoning C. perfringens 
nosocomial diarrhea and C. perfringens type C necrotizing jejunitis (pig-bel). 
C. perfringens is also the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in 
animals, although Clostridium septicum causing braxy in sheep, Clostridium 
colinum causing ulcerative enteritis is avian species, and Clostridium 
spiroforme causing enterotoxemia in rabbits are important exceptions.
