Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, and major 
cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Related studies have identified numerous factors 
that influence virulence traits such as the production of the two primary 
toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), as well as sporulation, motility, and 
biofilm formation. However, multiple putative transcriptional regulators are 
reportedly encoded in the genome, and additional factors are likely involved in 
virulence regulation. Although the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) 
has been studied extensively in Gram-negative bacteria, little is known about 
its function in Gram-positive bacteria, although homologs have been identified 
in the genome. This study revealed that disruption of the lone lrp homolog in C. 
difficile decelerated growth under nutrient-limiting conditions, increased TcdA 
and TcdB production. Lrp was also found to negatively regulate sporulation while 
positively regulate swimming motility in strain R20291, but not in strain 630. 
The C. difficile Lrp appeared to function through transcriptional repression or 
activation. In addition, the lrp mutant was relatively virulent in a mouse model 
of infection. The results of this study collectively demonstrated that Lrp has 
broad regulatory function in C. difficile toxin expression, sporulation, 
motility, and pathogenesis.
