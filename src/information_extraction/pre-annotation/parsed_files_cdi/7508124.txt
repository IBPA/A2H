Toxin A from Clostridium difficile mediates acute inflammatory enterocolitis in 
experimental animals, while cholera toxin causes noninflammatory secretory 
diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an antagonist to 
the peptide substance P, a constituent of primary sensory neurons known to 
participate in inflammatory responses, would inhibit toxin A-mediated enteritis 
in the rat ileum. Pretreatment of rats with CP-96,345 (2.5 mg per kg of body 
weight), a substance P antagonist, dramatically inhibited fluid secretion (P < 
0.01) and mannitol permeability (P < 0.01) in ileal loops exposed to toxin A. 
The protective effects, which were dose dependent, caused a significant 
reduction of inflammation in the lamina propria, reduction of the necrosis of 
intestinal epithelial cells, and complete inhibition of toxin A-mediated release 
of rat mast cell protease II, a specific product of rat mucosal mast cells. An 
inactive enantiomer of the substance P antagonist, CP-96,344, had no effect. In 
contrast, pretreatment with CP-96,345 had no inhibitory effect on the intestinal 
effects caused by administration of cholera toxin into the ileal loops. From 
these data, we conclude that the peptide substance P is involved in the 
secretory and inflammatory effects of toxin A but not of cholera toxin.
