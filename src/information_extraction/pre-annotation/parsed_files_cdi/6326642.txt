The effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was 
studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial 
populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect 
exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of 
the environment. Since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, 
we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. 
Faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained 
prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. These faecal samples were inoculated 
into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. The dominant floras of the 
human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. The faecal 
floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change 
resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. The drastic 
or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors 
against Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. 
The large variability between animals in the barrier effect against Clostridium 
difficile masked any possible role of the bran. Study of the transit of Bacillus 
spores in the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of 
differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according 
to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.
