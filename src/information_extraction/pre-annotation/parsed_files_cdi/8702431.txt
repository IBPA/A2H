Antigen (Ag)-stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activation and secretion were 
almost abolished by pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells for 
4 h with 5 ng/ml Clostridium difficile Toxin B which is known to inhibit Rho 
family proteins (Rho, Cdc42, Rac). The concentration-dependent inhibition of PLD 
activation was well correlated with the level of glucosylation of Rho family 
proteins. In streptolysin O-permeabilized RBL cells, Toxin B suppressed [3H] 
phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) formation in response to guanosine 
5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA) by 67 and 43%, respectively. The synergistic PLD activation by GTP gamma S 
and PMA was also reduced by Toxin B by 67%. These results suggest that the IgE 
receptor-coupled PLD activation is largely mediated by Rho proteins.
