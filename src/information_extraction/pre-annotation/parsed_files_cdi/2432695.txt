Exposure of isolated rat pancreatic acini to increasing concentrations (10 ng - 
800 ng/ml) of toxin B from Clostridium difficile produced a biphasic effect on 
the rate of secretion of amylase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen. Whereas 
doses of toxin B from 10-30 ng/ml increased enzyme secretion by 15-20%, doses 
between 30 ng and 60 ng/ml showed a regression of this effect, whereafter the 
rate of secretion of amylase, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen increased with 
increasing concentrations of the toxin. Toxin B concentration of 800 ng/ml 
enhanced amylase, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen secretion by 119%, 185% and 
195%, respectively, when compared with the basal level. Stimulation of enzyme 
secretion by toxin B was not affected by the presence of either actinomycin-D or 
cycloheximide, at a concentration which inhibited acinar RNA or protein 
synthesis by 80-90%. Although toxin B as well as CCK8, carbachol and secretin by 
themselves caused significant stimulation in amylase, trypsinogen and 
chymotrypsinogen secretion from isolated pancreatic acini, toxin B together with 
either CCK8, carbachol or secretin produced no further augmentation in enzyme 
secretion than what was observed with the secretagogues alone. It is concluded 
that toxin B of Cl. difficile exerts a direct effect on pancreatic acinar cells 
as evidenced by stimulation of enzyme secretion.
