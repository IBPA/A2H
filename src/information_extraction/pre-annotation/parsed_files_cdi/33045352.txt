Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a principal cause of 
hospital-acquired infections and fatalities worldwide. The need for new, more 
potent anticlostridial agents is far from being met. Drug repurposing can be 
utilized as a rapid and cost-efficient method of drug development. The current 
study was conducted to evaluate the activity of ronidazole, a veterinary 
antiprotozoal drug, as a potential treatment for CDI. Ronidazole inhibited the 
growth of clinical C. difficile isolates (including NAP1 and toxigenic strains) 
at a very low concentration (0.125 µg/mL) and showed superior killing kinetics 
compared with metronidazole, an anticlostridial agent from the same chemical 
category. In addition, ronidazole did not inhibit growth of several commensal 
organisms naturally present in the human intestine that play a protective role 
in preventing CDIs. Furthermore, ronidazole was found to be non-toxic to human 
gut cells and permeated a monolayer of colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) at a 
slower rate than metronidazole. Finally, ronidazole outperformed metronidazole 
when both were tested at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily in a mouse model of CDI. 
Overall, ronidazole merits further investigation as a potential treatment for 
CDIs.
