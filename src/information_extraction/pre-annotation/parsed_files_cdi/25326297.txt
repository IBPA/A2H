Clostridium difficile is an important enteric pathogen of humans and the cause 
of diarrhea and enteritis in neonatal pigs. Outside Australia, prevalence in 
piglets can be up to 73%, with a single PCR ribotype (RT), 078, predominating. 
We investigated the prevalence and genotype of C. difficile in Australian pig 
herds. Rectal swabs (n = 229) were collected from piglets aged <7 days from 21 
farms across Australia. Selective culture for C. difficile was performed and 
isolates characterized by PCR for toxin genes and PCR ribotyping. C. difficile 
was isolated from 52% of samples by direct culture on chromogenic agar and 67% 
by enrichment culture (P = 0.001). No association between C. difficile recovery 
or genotype and diarrheic status of either farm or piglets was found. The 
majority (87%; 130/154) of isolates were toxigenic. Typing revealed 23 different 
RTs, several of which are known to cause disease in humans, including RT014, 
which was isolated most commonly (23%; 36/154). RT078 was not detected. This 
study shows that colonization of Australian neonatal piglets with C. difficile 
is widespread in the herds sampled.
