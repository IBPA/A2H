BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic condition and the most common 
form of inflammatory bowel disease. The goal of standard treatment is mainly to 
induce and maintain remission with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive agents, 
and/or colectomy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used 
successfully to treat relapsing or refractory Clostridium difficile infection. 
The alteration of microbiota in mouse models of UC as well as in patients 
suggested the possibility of treating UC with FMT.
AIMS: To study the effects of FMT on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC 
model in mice.
METHODS: Littermates of BALB/c and C57BL/6J were randomized into four groups: 
normal control , treatment with DSS for 7 days (DSS - FMT), treatment with DSS 
followed by FMT for another 8 days (DSS + FMT), and treatment with DSS and FMT 
followed by another 5 days for recovery (remission). Body weight, survival rate, 
and DAI scores of mice in each group were recorded. Changes in distal colon were 
studied by histopathology. Alterations of spleen and lamina propria regulatory 
lymphocytes, major bacterial species in feces and inflammatory cytokines in 
colon were also studied.
RESULTS: C57BL/6J mice experienced more significant weight loss than BALB/c mice 
after DSS treatment, regardless of whether the two strains of mice were 
co-housed or not. FMT caused reversal of DAI scores in BALB/c but not in 
C57BL/6J mice. In BALB/c mice, FMT also reduced colon inflammation that was 
paralleled by decreased inflammatory cytokine levels, altered bacterial 
microbiota, and regulatory lymphocyte proportions.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT is effective in a mouse model of UC through its modulation on 
gut microbiota and the host immune system.
