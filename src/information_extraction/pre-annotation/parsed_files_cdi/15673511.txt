Molecular typing of Clostridium difficile isolates from animals and humans may 
be useful for evaluation of the possibility for interspecies transmission. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate C. difficile isolates from domestic 
animals and humans using PCR ribotyping. Isolates were also tested using PCR for 
the presence of genes encoding toxins A and B. One hundred and thirty-three 
isolates of C. difficile from dogs (n = 92), horses (n = 21) and humans (n = 
20), plus one each from a cat and a calf, were evaluated. Overall, 23 ribotypes 
were identified. Of these, nine were identified from dogs, 12 from horses, seven 
from humans and one each from the cat and calf. In dogs, humans and horses, one 
or two different ribotypes predominated. Overall, 25 % of isolates from humans 
were indistinguishable from isolates from one or more animal species. Genes 
encoding C. difficile toxins A and B were detected in all human, equine and 
bovine isolates, and in 69 % of canine isolates. While different ribotypes 
appear to predominate in different mammalian species, several indistinguishable 
strains may be found in multiple species. This suggests that there is a 
potential for interspecies transmission of C. difficile and epidemiological 
studies are warranted.
