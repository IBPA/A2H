Clostridium difficile TcdB harbors a glucosyltransferase that targets host Rho 
GTPases. However, the role of the enzyme activity in the induction of host 
intestinal disease has not been demonstrated. In this study, we established a 
mouse acute intestinal disease model by cecum injection of wild type and 
glucosyltransferase-deficient TcdB and a chronic model by delivering toxin 
intraluminally via engineered surrogate host Bacillus megaterium. We 
demonstrated, for the first time, that the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdB 
is essential for inducing disease symptoms and intestinal pathological responses 
that resemble human disease, highlighting the importance of targeting toxin 
glucosyltransferase activity for future therapy.
