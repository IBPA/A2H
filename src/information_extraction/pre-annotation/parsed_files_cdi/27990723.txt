AIMS: To determine the presence of Clostridium difficile on fattening pig farms 
in north-eastern Spain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-seven farms were sampled. Pools of pig faecal 
samples (n = 210), samples of intestinal content from common farm pest species 
(n = 95) and environment-related samples (n = 93) were collected. Isolates were 
tested for toxin genes of C. difficile, and typed by PCR-ribotyping and 
toxinotyping. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobial agents 
were determined using Etest. Thirty-four isolates were obtained from 12 farms, 
and 30 (88·2%) had toxin genes. Seven ribotypes were identified. Ribotype 078 
and its variant 126 were predominant (52·9%). The same ribotypes were isolated 
from different animal species on the same farm. None of the isolates were 
resistant to metronidazole or vancomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile was common within the pig farm environment. 
Most of the positive samples came from pest species or were pest-related 
environmental samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pest species were colonized with toxigenic 
and antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile strains of the same ribotypes that are 
found in humans and pigs. Rodents and pigeons may transmit toxigenic and 
antimicrobial-resistant C. difficile strains that are of the same ribotypes as 
those occuring in humans.
