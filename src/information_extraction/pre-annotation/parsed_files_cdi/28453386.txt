Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common causes of 
healthcare-associated infections but an even bigger problem for the aging 
population. Advanced age leads to higher incidence, higher mortality, and higher 
recurrences. In our study, recently published in the Journal of Infectious 
Diseases, we investigated the effect of aging on CDI using a mouse model. We 
were able to demonstrate that aging leads to worse clinical outcomes, as well as 
lead to changes in microbiota composition and lower antibody production against 
C. difficile toxin A, but not toxin B. An association between advanced age and 
lower antibody production against C. difficile is a new finding which would 
explain the effect of aging on CDI outcome. Vancomycin, an anti-C. difficile 
antibiotic, led to similar changes in antibody response, suggesting a connection 
between microbiome and antibody response in the context of aging, which would 
require a much more nuanced look at the treatment of CDI.
