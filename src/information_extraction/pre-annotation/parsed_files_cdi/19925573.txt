BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the 
underlying causes are poorly understood.
HYPOTHESIS: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and Clostridium difficile 
Toxin A and B are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs.
ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty-five sled dogs.
METHODS: Freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 
80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. Samples were visually scored for diarrhea, 
mucus, blood, and melena. CPE and C. difficile Toxin A and B were detected by 
ELISA. Samples were cultured for C. perfringens, C. difficile, Campylobacter, 
Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157; Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. were 
detected via immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal 
mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. Salmonella was isolated 
from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. C. 
perfringens and C. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before 
racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. Dogs were more likely to 
test positive for CPE during than before racing (18.8 versus 5.5%, P = .021); 
however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly 
associated with hematochezia or diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sled dogs participating in long distance 
racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not 
associated with common enteropathogens. It is possible that diarrhea and 
hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal 
tract.
