New therapies are needed to prevent and treat Clostridium difficile infection 
and to limit the rise in antibiotic resistance. Besides toxins, several surface 
components have been characterized as colonization factors and have been shown 
as immunogenic. This review will focus on passive and active immunization 
strategies targeting C. difficile surface components to combat C. difficile. 
Concerning passive immunization, the first strategies used antisera raised 
against the entire bacterium to prevent infection in the hamster model. Then, 
surface components such as the flagellin and the S-layer proteins were used for 
immunization and the passive transfer of antibodies was protective in animal 
models. Passive immunotherapy with polyvalent immunoglobulins was used in humans 
and bovine immunoglobulin concentrates were evaluated in clinical trials. 
Concerning active immunization, vaccine assays targeting surface components were 
tested mainly in animal models, mouse models of colonization and hamster models 
of infection. Bacterial extracts, spore proteins and surface components of 
vegetative cells such as cell wall proteins, flagellar proteins, and 
polysaccharides were used as vaccine targets. Vaccine assays were performed by 
parenteral and mucosal routes of immunization. Both gave promising results and 
pave the way to development of new vaccines.
