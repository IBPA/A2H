Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory 
disease worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the inflammasome adaptor Pyrin, 
but how FMF mutations alter signaling in FMF patients is unknown. Herein, we 
establish Clostridium difficile and its enterotoxin A (TcdA) as Pyrin-activating 
agents and show that wild-type and FMF Pyrin are differentially controlled by 
microtubules. Diverse microtubule assembly inhibitors prevented Pyrin-mediated 
caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1Î² and IL-18 from mouse macrophages and 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Remarkably, Pyrin inflammasome 
activation persisted upon microtubule disassembly in PBMCs of FMF patients but 
not in cells of patients afflicted with other autoinflammatory diseases. We 
further demonstrate that microtubules control Pyrin activation downstream of 
Pyrin dephosphorylation and that FMF mutations enable microtubule-independent 
assembly of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase 
recruitment domain (ASC) micrometer-sized perinuclear structures (specks). The 
discovery that Pyrin mutations remove the obligatory requirement for 
microtubules in inflammasome activation provides a conceptual framework for 
understanding FMF and enables immunological screening of FMF mutations.
