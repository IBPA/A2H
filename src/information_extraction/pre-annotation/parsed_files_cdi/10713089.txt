Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 monomeric GTPases are well known regulators of the actin 
cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone 
secretion in endocrine cells. Here, we examine their possible implication in 
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Using subcellular 
fractionation procedures, we found that RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Cdc42 are present 
in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only Rac1 was associated with highly 
purified synaptic vesicles. To determine the synaptic function of these GTPases, 
toxins that impair Rho-related proteins were microinjected into Aplysia neurons. 
We used lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inactivates Rac; toxin B 
from Clostridium difficile, which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42; and C3 
exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from 
Escherichia coli, which mainly affect Rho. Analysis of the toxin effects on 
evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the Rho family, most 
likely Rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. 
Strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin B could 
be completely removed in <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. 
Further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin 
suggests that Rac1 protein regulates a late step in Ca(2+)-dependent 
neuroexocytosis.
