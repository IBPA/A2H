Zoonotic transmission of Clostridium difficile has been largely hypothesised to 
occur after direct or indirect contact with contaminated animal faeces. Recent 
studies have reported the presence of the bacterium in the natural environment, 
including in soils and rivers. If C. difficile spores are scattered in the 
environment, they can easily enter the respiratory tract of dogs, and therefore, 
dog nasal discharge could be a direct route of transmission not previously 
investigated. This study reports for the first time the presence of C. difficile 
in the respiratory tracts of dogs. The bacterium was isolated from 6 (17.1%) out 
of 35 nasal samples, with a total of 4 positive dogs (19%). C. difficile was 
recovered from both proximal and distal nasal cavities. All isolates were 
toxigenic and belonged to PCR-ribotype 014, which is one of the most predominant 
types in animals and in community-acquired C. difficile infections in recent 
years. The findings of this study demonstrate that the nasal cavity of dogs is 
contaminated with toxigenic C. difficile, and therefore, its secretions could be 
considered as a new route by which bacteria are spread and transmitted.
