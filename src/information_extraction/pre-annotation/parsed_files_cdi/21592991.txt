A pig ligated loop model was used to analyze the in vivo transcriptome response 
of Clostridium difficile. Bacterial RNA from the loops was retrieved at 
different times and was used for microarray analysis. Several 
virulence-associated genes and genes involved in sporulation cascade were 
differentially expressed (DE). In concordance with observed upregulation of 
toxin genes in microarray, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay estimation of total 
toxin showed high amounts of toxin in the loops. Several genes that were absent 
in primary annotation of C. difficile 630 but annotated in a secondary 
annotation were found to be DE. Pathway comparison of DE genes in vitro and in 
vivo showed that when several pathways were expressed in all conditions, several 
of the C. difficile pathways were uniquely expressed only in vivo. The pathways 
observed to be modulated only in this study could be targets of new therapeutic 
agents against C. difficile infection.
