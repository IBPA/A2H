The mechanisms by which Clostridium difficile causes diarrhoea are unknown. The 
expression of putative virulence factors by 44 Clostridium difficile strains 
isolated from patients with and without diarrhoea was studied. Toxins A and B 
were tested in CHO and MRC-5 cells, respectively; adherence was measured in two 
substrates: HEp-2 cells and polystyrene plates. The in vitro expression of 
toxins A and B by strains isolated from patients with diarrhoea was not 
significantly different from that by strains isolated from patients without 
diarrhoea. The ability of adherence to both HEp-2 cells and polystyrene by 
strains isolated from patients with diarrhoea was not significantly different 
when compared with strains isolated from patients without diarrhoea; however, 
strains isolated from adults with diarrhoea seem to adhere to a greater extent 
to both substrates than strains isolated from adults without diarrhoea. Twenty 
three strains which did not produce toxins A and B were tested for 
enterotoxicity in rat small intestine. Eight such strains induced fluid 
accumulation and seven of them were isolated from children. Adherence to cells 
and to polystyrene might be an important virulence factor in strains causing 
diarrhoea in adults; whereas the production of toxins other than A and B might 
be an important pathogenic mechanism in strains causing diarrhoea in children.
