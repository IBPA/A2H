Clostridium difficile has been documented as a major cause of uncontrolled 
outbreaks of enteritis in neonatal pigs and antibiotic-associated infections in 
clinical settings. It belongs to the natural cohort of early colonisers of the 
gastrointestinal tract of pigs and can be detected in faeces up to two weeks 
post-partum. In older pigs, it often remains under the detection limit. Most 
neonatal pigs show no clinical signs of disease although C. difficile and its 
toxins can be detected at high levels in faeces. Increased mortality rates 
associated with C. difficile on pig farms are, so far, considered "spontaneous" 
and the predisposing factors are mostly not defined. The infection caused by C. 
difficile is multifactorial and it is likely that the repertoire of maternal 
factors, host physiology, the individually developing gut microbiota, 
co-infections and environmental stress define the conditions for disease 
development. In this addendum to our recently published work on CDI in neonatal 
piglets, we discuss the "early-life events" that influence C. difficile spread 
and infection in neonatal piglets.
